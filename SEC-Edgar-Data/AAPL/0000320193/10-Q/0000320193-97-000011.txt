APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)


1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the 
Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim
results have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature
unless specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 27, 1996, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended September 27, 1996 (the 1996 Form 10-K).


2.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations. The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the Company's 
adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a net 
charge of $179 million after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 1996. In the second quarter of 1997, the Company announced and 
began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing 
objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $155 million charge in the 
second quarter for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. The 
restructuring actions consist of terminating approximately 3,500 full-time 
employees, approximately 2,100 of whom have been terminated from the second
quarter of 1996 through March 28, 1997, excluding employees who were hired by
SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data 
center facility, respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases 
as a result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, 
buildings and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations 
and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts for 
projects and technologies that are not central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash 
expenditures of $79 million and noncash asset write-downs of $28 million from 
the second quarter of 1996 through March 28, 1997. The Company expects that 
the remaining $227 million accrued balance at March 28, 1997 will result in 
cash expenditures of approximately $170 million over the next twelve months
and $11 million thereafter. The Company expects that most of the contemplated 
restructuring actions related to the plan will be completed within the next 
six months and will be financed through current working capital and continued 
short-term borrowings.

3.	On February 4, 1997, the Company acquired all of the 
outstanding shares of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"). NeXT, headquartered in 
Redwood City, California, had developed, marketed and supported 
software that enables customers to easily and quickly implement business 
applications on the Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-
wide client/server networks. The total purchase price was $424 million and 
was comprised of cash payments of $319 million and the issuance of 1.5 
million shares of the Company's common stock to the NeXT shareholders 
valued at approximately $25 million according to the terms of the purchase 
agreement; the issuance of approximately 1.8 million options to 
purchase the Company's common stock to the NeXT optionholders valued at 
approximately $16 million based on the difference between the exercise price 
of the options and the market value of the Company's stock on the date the 
options were  granted; cash payments of $56 million to the NeXT debtholders; 
and cash payments of $8 million for closing and related costs. The acquisition 
was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results 
pertaining to NeXT subsequent to the date of acquisition have been included 
in the Company's consolidated operating results. The excess purchase price
over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was $422 million of 
which $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and 
development and $47 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible 
assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged to 
operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other intangible assets are 
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 2 to 7 years. The purchase price 
allocation is based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of the acquired 
net assets and in-process research and development and may be subject to 
adjustment as management completes its evaluation of the technology 
acquired and additional information becomes available during 1997.

	The following unaudited proforma summary combines the 
consolidated results of operations of the Company and NeXT as if the 
acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the three and six months 
ended March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996, after giving effect to certain 
adjustments, including in-process research and development, 
amortization of intangible assets, lower interest income as a result of lower 
cash investment balances, and lower interest expense as a result of the 
settlement of the NeXT debt, and related income tax effects. The proforma 
summary does not necessarily reflect the results of operations as they would 
have been had the Company and NeXT been combined as of the beginning of 
such periods.

4.	In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share"
("FAS 128"). Under the provisions of FAS 128, primary earnings per share will
be replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully diluted earnings per 
share will be replaced with  diluted earnings per share for companies with 
potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and convertible 
debt. FAS 128 is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December
15, 1997 and will require restatement of all comparative per share amounts. 
The basic loss per share will be no different than the primary loss per share 
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as 
neither consider outstanding options or convertible debt. If and when the 
Company becomes profitable, it will be required to present both basic and 
diluted earnings per share.  Basic earnings per share, which does not consider 
potentially dilutive securities, will be greater than the replaced primary 
earnings per share which did consider those securities. In addition, diluted 
earnings per share will not differ materially from the replaced fully 
diluted earnings per share.

Overview

During the second quarter of 1997, the Company continued to experience 
declines in net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer 
market. Faced with this continued decline in demand and the resulting 
continued operating losses, coupled with intense price competition 
throughout the industry, the Company announced and began to effect 
supplemental restructuring actions, including significant additional 
headcount reductions, in order to reduce costs and return the Company to 
sustainable profitability. In addition, the Company completed its acquisition 
of NeXT. The Company plans to develop and market a new operating system 
("OS") based on its Mac OS and NeXT software technologies.

Net Sales

Q2 97 compared with Q2 96

Net sales decreased 27% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 33% and 44%, respectively, in the second quarter of 
1997, compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a decline in 
worldwide demand for most product families, especially the Performa(R) and 
Power Macintosh(R) lines of consumer-oriented products, which the Company 
believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the 
Company's strategic direction, financial condition, future prospects 
and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures 
in the marketplace. In addition, Macintosh unit sales were negatively 
affected as a result of the Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders 
of Power Macintosh products due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities 
of certain components and product transition constraints. The average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased 9% in the second quarter of 
1997 compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a shift in mix 
toward the Company's newer and higher priced PowerBook(R) and Power Macintosh
products, partially offset by continued pricing actions, including 
rebates, across the Performa and other product lines in an effort to stimulate 
demand. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product 
increased 22% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 
1996, as a result of a shift in mix toward the Company's newer and higher
priced products, partially offset by continued pricing actions, including 
rebates, across most product lines in an effort to stimulate demand.  The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit and per peripheral 
unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of 
factors, including industrywide pricing pressures, increased 
competition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products.

International net sales represented 49% of total net sales in the second 
quarter of 1997 compared with 59% in the same period of 1996. International 
net sales declined 39% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Net sales in both European markets and Japan decreased 
during the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same period in 1996, 
as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an 
increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 9% in the second quarter of 1997, over the 
comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products, partially offset by increases in the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit.

According to industry sources, in the second quarter of 1997 compared with 
the comparable period of 1996, the Company's approximate share of the 
worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 3.1% from 5.8% and 
to 4.0% from 7.3%, respectively. In addition, the Company believes that its 
licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer market increased to 
approximately 0.3% from approximately 0.1%.

Six Months Ended March 28, 1997 compared with Six Months Ended 
March 29, 1996

Net sales decreased 30% in the first six months of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 30% and 34%, respectively, in the first six months of 
1997, compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a decline in 
worldwide demand for most product families, especially the Performa line 
of consumer-oriented products, which the Company believes was due 
principally to customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic 
direction, financial condition, future prospects and the viability of the 
Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. In 
addition, Macintosh unit sales were negatively affected as a result of the 
Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders of Power Macintosh 
products due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain 
components and product transition constraints. The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh unit decreased 3% in the first six months of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to continued pricing 
actions, including rebates, across most product lines in an effort to 
stimulate demand, partially offset by a shift in mix toward higher priced 
PowerBook and Power Macintosh products. The average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral product increased 15% in the first six months of 1997 compared 
with the same period of 1996, as a result of a shift in mix toward the 
Company's newer and higher priced products, partially offset by continued 
pricing actions, including rebates, across most product lines in an effort 
to stimulate demand.

International net sales represented 53% of total net sales in the first six 
months of 1997 compared with 54% in the same period of 1996. International 
net sales declined 31% in the first six months of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased 
during the first six months of 1997 compared with the same period in 1996, 
as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an 
increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 29% in the first six months of 1997, over the 
comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products and a slight decrease in the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the 
average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.

Q2 97 compared with Q1 97 

Net sales decreased 25% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first 
quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 35% in 
the second quarter of 1997 compared with the prior quarter primarily as a 
result of a decline in unit sales of Performa and Power Macintosh 
products, which the Company believes was due principally to customer 
concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition, 
future prospects and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to 
competitive pressures in the marketplace, as well as the seasonal 
decline in unit sales and a reduction in channel inventory levels from the 
first quarter to the second quarter, partially offset by an increase in unit 
sales of PowerBook products as a result of new product introductions which 
satisfied pent-up demand. Power Macintosh unit sales were negatively 
affected as a result of the Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders 
due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain components and 
product transition constraints. Unit sales of peripheral products decreased 
38% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 
1997. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit 
increased 14% and 11%, respectively, in the second quarter of 1997 compared 
with the first quarter of 1997, primarily due to a shift in product mix 
toward the Company's newer and higher priced products.

<PAGE> 

International net sales represented 49% of total net sales in the second 
quarter of 1997, compared with 56% in the first quarter of 1997. International 
net sales decreased 34% in the second quarter compared with the first 
quarter of 1997. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased during 
the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 1997, as a result of 
decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an increase in the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. 

Domestic net sales declined 13% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with 
the prior quarter, due to decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
partially offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh and peripheral unit.

According to industry sources, in the second quarter of 1997 compared with 
the first quarter of 1997, the Company's share of the worldwide and U.S. 
personal computer markets declined to 3.1% from 4.3%, and to 4.0% from 5.2%, 
respectively. In addition, the Company believes that its licensees' share of 
the worldwide personal computer market decreased to approximately 0.3% from 
approximately 0.5%.

In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed 
basis. Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates 
depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders ("backlog") 
can be, and often are, canceled at will. The Company attempts to fill orders 
on the requested delivery schedules. The Company's backlog decreased to 
approximately $409 million at May 2, 1997, from approximately $454 million 
at January 31, 1997, primarily due to a decrease in backlog of PowerBook 
product as a result of satisfying pent-up demand, partially offset by an 
increase in backlog of Power Macintosh product due to the 
Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders, as discussed above.

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at 
any particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its future 
business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation 
of or immediately following introduction of new products because 
of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often 
is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient 
supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of 
the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial 
performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the prior 
year's comparable periods through at least the fourth quarter of 1997, if not 
longer.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net 
sales and its cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated by the 
sale of products is influenced principally by the price set by the 
Company for its products relative to competitive products. The cost of goods 
sold is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, 
direct labor costs. The type and cost of components included in particular 
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk 
drives) are often directly related to the need to market products in 
configurations competitive with other manufacturers. Competition in the 
personal computer industry is intense and, in the short term, frequent 
changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary in 
order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short 
term by actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide 
competitive pressures.




				11
<PAGE> 

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales in the second 
quarter and the first six months of 1997, respectively, when compared 
with the corresponding periods of 1996, primarily as a result of a $616 
million charge in the second quarter of 1996 that related principally to the 
write-down of certain inventory, as well as to the cost to cancel excess 
component orders necessitated by significantly lower than expected 
demand for many of the Company's products, primarily its entry level 
products. Also, the Company separately incurred a $60 million charge in the 
second quarter of 1996 to reflect the estimated cost to correct certain quality 
problems in certain entry level, Performa and PowerBook products. In 
addition, gross margins in the second quarter of 1996, and to a lesser degree 
the first quarter of that year, were adversely affected by aggressive 
pricing actions in Japan in response to extreme competitive actions by other 
companies, as well as pricing actions in the U.S. and Europe across all 
product lines in order to stimulate demand.

Gross margin remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales in the second 
quarter, compared with the first quarter of 1997, primarily due to a shift 
in mix toward higher priced and higher margin PowerBook products, 
offset by continued pricing actions, including rebates, across the Performa 
and other product lines in an effort to stimulate demand. 

The gross margin levels in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first 
quarter of 1997 and the second quarter of 1996, and in the first 6 months of 
1997 compared with the corresponding period of 1996, were also adversely 
affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, 
offset by hedging gains. The Company's operating strategy and 
pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the 
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term 
by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain the 
gross margin levels achieved in the second quarter and in the first six 
months of 1997. Gross margins will remain under significant downward 
pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industrywide 
pricing pressures around the world, increased competition, and compressed 
product life cycles. In response to those downward pressures, the 
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its 
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to 
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate 
demand for certain of its products.

Research and development expenditures decreased slightly in 
amount in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 1997 
and the second quarter of 1996, and during the first six months of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to reduced expenditures 
as a result of the Company initiating certain restructuring actions late in 
the second quarter of 1997. The increases as a percentage of net sales 
resulted from decreases in the levels of net sales.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the 
marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new 
and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The Company believes its research and development 
expenditures will significantly decrease in the third and fourth 
quarters of 1997 compared with the same periods of the prior year and 
compared with the second quarter of 1997, as the Company completes and 
more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan. For 
additional information regarding the restructuring plan, refer to Note 2 of 
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 
I, and to Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition as

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount in the 
second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 1997 and the second 
quarter of 1996, and during the first six months of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996, primarily due to reduced expenditures as a result of 
actions taken under the Company's restructuring plan. In addition, 
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount in the 
second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter due to the higher 
level of advertising and marketing expenditures incurred during the first 
quarter for the holiday buying season. The increases as a percentage of net 
sales resulted from decreases in the levels of net sales.  

The Company believes its selling, general and administrative 
expenditures will significantly decrease in the third and fourth 
quarters of 1997 compared with the same quarters of the prior year and 
compared with the second quarter of 1997, as the Company completes and 
more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan, 
slightly offset by the amortization expense on the intangible assets the 
Company recognized as a result of the acquisition of NeXT. For additional

acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes to the

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased slightly in the second 
quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, primarily as a 
result of higher interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on 
foreign exchange instruments. Interest and other income (expense), 
net, increased in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 
1997, primarily as a result of higher net gains on foreign exchange 
instruments.

Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased in the first six months of 
1997 compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to lower foreign 
currency gains, partially offset by greater interest income.

The Company expects interest income to decrease in the third and fourth 
quarters of 1997 compared with the immediate prior quarters, due to lower 
cash balances as a result of cash used to acquire NeXT, fund the restructuring 
actions over primarily the next two quarters, and fund operations over at 
least the next quarter.

In the second quarter of 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and to B3 and Caa, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. These actions could increase the Company's cost of funds in future 
periods.

At March 28, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $651 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. In
the first six months of 1997, a valuation allowance of $199 million was 
recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which 
may not be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset is 
dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 million of 
future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more likely than not 
that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. income. However, there 
can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. 
income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered 
realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future 
taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's financial results and condition. The 
Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

Overview

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are 
dependent upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, 
and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic 
customer demand patterns, and its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the 
viability of the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number 
of factors that the Company must successfully manage in order to 
achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition. 
Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future 
operating results and financial condition include, without limitation, 
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any 
reaction by the Company to such competitive pressures, including 
pricing actions by the Company; the Company's ability to supply products in 
certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current 
Macintosh operating system ("Mac(R) OS") and to make timely delivery of a 
new and substantially backward-compatible OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate NeXT technologies, processes and employees 
with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully implement its 
strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; 
the effects of significant adverse publicity; and the availability of third-
party software for particular applications.

The Company expects that it will not return to profitability until at least the 
fourth quarter of 1997, if not later.

Restructuring of Operations and New Business Model

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring 
actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its 
competitiveness, and restoring sustained profitability. In the second 
quarter of 1997, the Company announced and began to implement 
supplemental restructuring actions, including significant headcount 
reductions, to meet the foregoing objectives. There are several risks 
inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure. 
These include the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce 
expenditures quickly enough to restore sustained profitability and the risk 
that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate 
and remain competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has been implementing a 
new business model. Implementation of the new business model involves 
several risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the 
Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce 
overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and technology. 
Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing the 
proportion of the Company's products to be manufactured under outsourcing 
arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality or quantity of 
the products manufactured, or lose the flexibility to make timely changes in 
production schedules in order to respond to changing market 
conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely affect 
employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and 
motivate employees. Also, because the new business model contemplates that 
the Company will rely to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing 
arrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control 
over certain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to 
create innovative new products may be reduced. In addition, the new business 
model now includes the acquisition of NeXT. There can be no assurance that the 
technologies acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key 
NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated with 
those at Apple. Finally, even if the new business model is successfully 
implemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively 
					17
<PAGE> 

resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In addition, 
although the Company believes that the actions it is taking and will take 
under its restructuring plan and its acquisition of NeXT should help restore 
marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can be no 
assurance that such actions will be successful.

For the foregoing reasons, there can be no assurance that the new business 
model, including the restructuring actions and the acquisition of NeXT, 
will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing its cost 
structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustained profitability. The Company's future operating results and financial 
condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty in 
effectively managing the transition to the new business model and cost 
structure.

For information regarding the Company's restructuring actions and 
the acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to 
Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.


Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is 
characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid 
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products 
and product enhancements, including the recent introductions of certain 
PowerBook and Power Macintosh products. The success of new product 
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market 
acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with 
product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, 
the effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate 
quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may 
have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. 
Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new 
products will have on its sales or results of operations. In addition, 
although the number of new product introductions may decrease under the 
Company's new business model, the risks and uncertainties associated with 
new product introductions may increase as the Company refocuses its 
product offerings on key growth segments.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of 
a new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of 
shipments for that product, which depends on many factors, some of 
which are not under the control of the Company. These factors may include 
initial large purchases by a small segment of the user population that 
tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority 
of users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by 
users who anticipated new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases of 
other products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to 
the aforementioned factors. These factors may be offset by others, such as 
the deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted 
as "proven" and for which commonly used software products are available; 
and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain 
sufficient supply of products previously in backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with 
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can 
obtain sufficient supply of the new products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further 
complicated by the availability of different product configurations, 
which may include various types of built-in peripherals and software. 
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) 
for various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas 
may be a function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of 
				18
<PAGE> 

European-language versions of software products manufactured by 
U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a 
quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's 
new products outside the United States, even though localized versions of the 
Company's products may be available.

The increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations 
of the Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or 
other faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes 
of products have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were 
significant, the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs 
under product warranties.

The Company recently announced a "dual track" approach to its OS 
development. The Company plans to continue to introduce enhancements to 
the current Mac OS and later introduce a new OS (code named "Rhapsody") 
which is expected to offer advanced functionality based upon the Mac OS 
and NeXT software technologies. However, the NeXT software 
technologies that the Company plans to use in the development of Rhapsody 
were not originally designed to be compatible with the Mac OS. As a result, 
there can be no assurance that the development of Rhapsody will be 
successful. In addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible with 
all existing applications, which could result in a loss of existing customers. 
Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody or the planned 
enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain developer support and market 
acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a 
substantially backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements 
to the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market 
acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse impact 
on the Company's operating results and financial condition.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross 
margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, 
continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, 
price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of 
competitors. The Company's results of operations and financial condition 
have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by 
industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. 
The industry has also been characterized by rapid technological 
advances in software functionality and hardware performance and features 
based on existing or emerging industry standards. Many of the Company's 
competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and 
technological resources, broader product lines and larger installed 
customer bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by overall demand for personal computers and general 
customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product 
features over another.

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Mac 
OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer 
market, which is dominated by makers of computers that run the MS-DOS and 
Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, 
with its perceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving 
force behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the 
past several years. Recent innovations in the Windows platform, including 
those included in Windows 95 and Windows NT, have added features to the 
Windows platform which make the differences between the Mac OS and 
Microsoft's operating systems less significant.  The Company is currently 
taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures 
being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent 
innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results 
and financial condition may be affected by its ability to maintain and 
increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.  

As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh 
platform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other 
personal computer vendors in 1995 and 
				19
<PAGE> 

1996. Several vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh 
operating system. The Company believes that licensing the operating 
system will result in a broader installed base on which software vendors can 
develop and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh 
platform. However, there can be no assurance that the installed base will 
be broadened by the licensing of the operating system or that licensing will 
result in an increase in the number of application software titles or the rate 
at which vendors will bring to market application software based on the Mac 
OS. In addition, as a result of licensing its operating system, the Company 
competes with other companies producing Mac OS-based computer 
systems. The benefits to the Company from licensing the Mac OS to third 
parties may be more than offset by the disadvantages of competing with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS and 
Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward 
developing personal computer products capable of running 
application software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems 
("Cross-Platform Products"). These products include the RISC-based 
PowerPC(TM) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 586-class 
microprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing a Pentium or 
586-class microprocessor. These products enable users to run 
concurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, or 
Windows 95 operating systems. 

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who 
purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system software 
under licensing agreements with Microsoft. However, in order to do so, 
the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements with certain 
Microsoft distributors.

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and 
Motorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of 
specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware 
reference platform. These specifications define a "unified" 
personal computer architecture that gives access to both the Power 
Macintosh platform and the PC environment and utilizes standard 
industry components. The Company's future operating results and financial 
condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this 
agreement and to manage the risk associated with the transition to this 
new hardware reference platform. Microsoft recently announced that it 
would no longer adapt its Windows NT operating system software, which is 
being used more by corporations, to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. 
This decision may adversely affect revenues derived from this new 
hardware reference platform.

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as 
opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the 
availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company 
believes that the availability of third-party application software for the 
Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' 
perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, 
and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software 
for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market. This analysis is based on 
factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the 
anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of 
developing such software products. To the extent the Company's recent 
financial losses and declining demand for the Company's product have caused 
software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal 
computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new 
application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's 
products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and 
upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market. Microsoft 
Corporation is an important developer of application software for the 
Company's products. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing 
application software for the Company's products may be influenced by 
Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows 
operating systems. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also 
dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of 
the PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to 
supply to the Company in adequate numbers 
				20
<PAGE> 

microprocessors that produce superior price/performance results compared 
with those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, the 
developer and producer of the microprocessors used by most personal 
computers using the MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.  In 
addition, the desire of IBM and Motorola to continue producing these 
microprocessors may be influenced by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its 
Windows NT operating system software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. 
IBM produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as well 
as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the 
developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Mac 
OS. Accordingly,IBM's interest in supplying the Company with 
microprocessors for the Company's products may be influenced by IBM's 
perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal 
computers and as a competing operating system vendor.

Several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and Microsoft, 
have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the 
Company's key market segments, including education and publishing. 
Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, 
and technological resources than the Company.

The Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and existing 
hardware and software platforms. There can be no assurance that the 
Company will be able to continue to do so successfully. In addition, the 
Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing 
number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products 
addressing access to, authoring for, or communication over, the Internet. 
Many of these competitors have a significant lead over the Company in 
developing products for the Internet, have significantly greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the 
Company, or both.

Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's operations and 
financial results could be significantly affected by international factors, 
such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic 
conditions in the foreign markets in which the Company distributes its 
products. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, 
the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. 
dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. 
Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases 
when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than 
the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely 
affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. 
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's 
consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates 
on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and 
operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-
based exposures. Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts to hedge its assets, liabilities and firmly 
committed transactions. Currently, hedges of firmly committed 
transactions do not extend beyond one year. The Company also purchases 
foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain other probable but not 
firmly committed transactions. Hedges of probable but not firmly committed 
transactions currently do not extend beyond one year. To reduce the costs 
associated with these ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the 
Company also regularly sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters 
into certain other foreign exchange transactions. All foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all 
transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the Company's 
foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are 
adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  
				21
<PAGE> 

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest 
rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's 
interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general 
level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates 
affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments as well as interest paid on its notes payable to 
banks and long-term debt. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. 
interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, collar, 
and floor transactions. Certain of these transactions are intended to better 
match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments with the fixed-rate 
interest expense on its long-term debt. The Company also enters into these 
transactions in order to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure 
away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. These instruments 
may extend the Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum 
duration of three years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign 
exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the 
risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company 
continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and 
its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis
and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-
related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic 
perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk 
management activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned 
programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact 
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest 
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and 
losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not 
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying 
economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's 
operating results and financial position. The Company generally does not 
engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition is expected to increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of the 
hedging transactions into which the Company's counterparties are willing 
to enter.

Inventory and Supply

The Company provides reserves against any inventories of products that have 
become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand, accrues for any 
cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled, 
and accrues for the estimated costs to correct any product quality problems.  
Although the Company believes its inventory and related reserves are 
adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur 
additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges 
have had, and may again have, a material affect on the Company's 
financial position and results of operations.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory 
well in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are 
volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk 
that the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or 
insufficient inventories of particular products. The Company's operating 
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future 
be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its 
inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by 
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the 
Company or otherwise. As a result of the Company's restructuring actions, 
which include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, both in the second quarter of 
1996, the proportion of the Company's products produced and distributed 
under outsourcing arrangements will increase. While outsourcing 
				22
<PAGE> 

arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the 
direct control the Company has over production. It is uncertain what effect 
such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products 
manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing 
market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its 
inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement. 
Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain 
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains 
at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty 
service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, 
the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated product 
defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with 
contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's 
future operating results and financial condition.

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited 
by the availability of key components. The Company believes that the 
availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of 
microprocessors and ASICS presents the most significant potential for 
constraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production 
and thus have limited availability. The Company and other producers in the 
personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor 
products with other industries that have experienced increased demand 
for such products, due to either increased consumer demand or 
increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular 
phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some 
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry 
(including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of 
these components may be affected if producers were to decide to 
concentrate on the production of common components instead of 
components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product 
supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the 
Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's operating results 
and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the 
Company's products. Currently, the Company's primary means of 
distribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers 
include consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer 
electronics outlets, and computer superstores. The Company's business 
and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial 
condition of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer 
channels were to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's 
products.

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause 
resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. 
Under the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the 
option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most 
instances without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to return 
products to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond 
which they may be assessed fees. The Company has experienced a reduction 
in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty 
concerning the Company's condition and prospects.

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, 
its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including 
certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's 
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may 
subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, 
in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers 
with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its 
useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or 
recycling with the 
				23
<PAGE> 

Company. It is unclear what effect such regulation will have on the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company is currently reevaluating replacement of all its existing 
transaction systems (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated 
system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition could be 
adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and effectively 
manage the transition to this new integrated system, or, alternatively, if 
the Company is unable to effectively manage its existing transaction 
systems.  

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company entered into a 
"Master Logistics Management Services" agreement with Ryder 
Integrated Logistics, Inc. to outsource the Company's domestic operations 
transportation and logistics management. While this outsourcing 
agreement, and other similar agreements entered into to outsource 
the Company's European operations transportation and logistics 
management, may lower the Company's fixed costs of operations, it will also 
reduce the direct control the Company has over its transportation and 
logistics management. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control 
will have on the Company's transportation and logistics 
management.

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its Napa, 
California, data center to MCI Systemhouse ("MCI") and entered into a 
data processing outsourcing agreement with MCI in the fourth quarter of 1996. 
While this outsourcing agreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of 
operations, it will also reduce the direct control the Company has over its 
data processing. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will 
have on the Company's data processing.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial 
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation 
in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the 
Company's common stock price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, decreased to $1,326 
million at March 28, 1997, from $1,559 million at September 27, 1996. The 
Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments decreased to $1,459 million at March 28, 1997, from 
$1,745 million at September 27, 1996. The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balance at March 28, 1997 and September 27, 1996, includes $167 
million and $177 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support 
letters of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase 
commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first six months of 1997 totaled $194 
million, primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and 
inventories, partially offset by the Company's net loss adjusted for non-
cash expenses such as in-process research and development. The 
Company expects to use cash to fund operations over at least the next 
quarter.

The Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity 
investments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less 
for the remainder of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996. 



				24
<PAGE> 

Cash used to acquire NeXT totaled $383 million in the second quarter of 1997. 
The Company expects no additional cash expenditures related to the NeXT 
acquisition. Cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment 
totaled $36 million in the first six months of 1997, and consisted 
primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and 
equipment. The Company expects that the level of capital expenditures for 
the remainder of 1997 will be comparable to the same period of 1996.

In the second quarter of 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and to B3 and Caa, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. The Company was also placed on negative credit watch by Moody's 
Investor Services.  These actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in 
future periods.  In addition, the Company may be required to pledge 
additional collateral with respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of 
credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than in the past.

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term investments, together with continued short-term borrowings from 
banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next 12 
months. In addition to funding an expected net loss for at least the next  
quarter, expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include 
an estimated $170 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, 
most of which will be effected over the next two quarters. Also, the notes 
payable to banks all become due prior to July 1, 1997. No assurance can be 
given that short-term borrowings from banks can be continued, or that 
any additional required financing could be obtained should the 
restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be 
unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, 
results of operations, and financial condition would be materially 
adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute 
for these years have been resolved. On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice 
of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of the Company's federal 
income taxes for the years 1989 through 1991. The Company has filed a 
petition with the United States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax 
deficiencies. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for 
any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 45 of the Company's 1996 Annual Report on 
Form 10-K under the subheading "Litigation" and to page 23 of the 
Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended 
December 27, 1996 under the heading "Legal Proceedings" for a discussion of 
certain purported shareholder class action suits, certain consumer class 
actions relating to monitor-size advertising, and "repetitive stress 
injury" claims.

In February  1997, the Court in the case styled Abraham and Evelyn Kostick 
Trust v. Peter Crisp  et. al.  sustained the Company's demurrer with respect 
to purported class action claims and overruled it with respect to purported 
derivative claims. In April 1997, the Company filed a motion to strike most 
of the substantive allegations of the second amended complaint.

In February 1997, the Court in the case styled Derek Pritchard v. Michael 
Spindler et. al.  sustained the Company's demurrer and dismissed the 
plaintiff's first amended complaint, with prejudice.

In March 1997, the plaintiff in the case styled LS Men's Clothing Defined 
Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et. al.  filed an amended 
complaint expanding the class period from April 4, 1995 to January 15, 1997 
and adding several current and former officers of the Company as defendants. 
The Company intends to file a demurrer seeking dismissal of the 
amended complaint.

In March 1997, the court in the case styled In re Computer Monitor 
Litigation  preliminarily approved a proposed settlement to which the 
Company and all but three of the other defendants in the action are parties 
and provisionally certified a settlement class with respect thereto. A hearing 
regarding final approval of the proposed settlement is scheduled for 
June 30, 1997. If approved, the Company does not anticipate its 
obligations pursuant to the proposed settlement will have a material adverse 
effect on its financial condition as reported in the accompanying 
financial statements.

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of false or 
misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement 
of intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and other matters 
against the Company  and its subsidiaries incident to the operation 
of its business. The liability, if any, associated with these matters was not 
determinable as of the date of this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above will not have a 
material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. However, depending on the amount 
and timing of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is 
possible that the Company's future results of operations or cash flows 
could be materially affected in a particular period.

EXHIBIT 3.3
				  BY-LAWS

				     OF

			     APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

			  (a California corporation)

		     (as amended through April 4, 1997)


				 Article I

				  OFFICES

	Section 1.1:	Principal Office.  The principal executive office for the 
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop, 
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full 
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive 
office from one location to another.

	Section 1.2: 	Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate 
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at 
such place or places within or without the State of California as it deems 
appropriate.


Article II

DIRECTORS

	Section 2.1:	Exercise of Corporate Powers.  Except as otherwise 
provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this 
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in 
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all 
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of 
Directors.

	Section 2.2: 	Number.  The number of directors of the corporation 
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of 
directors shall be seven (7) until changed within the limits specified 
above, by a by-law amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of 
Directors or by the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors may be 
changed, or a definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite 
number, by a duly adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by 
an amendment to this by-law duly adopted by the vote or written consent 
of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; 
provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed number or the 
minimum number of directors to a number less than five (5) cannot be 
adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the 
shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by 
written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares 
entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum number of 
authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated 
minimum number of directors minus one.

	Section 2.3:	Need Not Be Shareholders.  The directors of this 
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.

	Section 2.4:	Compensation.  Directors and members of committees 
may receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed 
or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein 
contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving 
this corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
				30
<PAGE>

	Section 2.5:	Election and Term of Office.  The directors shall be
divided into two classes, designated Class I and Class II.  Each class shall 
consist of one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible.  
The initial term of office of the directors of Class I shall expire at the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991 and the initial term of 
office of the directors of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting to be 
held during fiscal year 1992.  At each annual meeting, commencing with the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991, each of the successors to 
the directors of the class whose term shall have expired at such annual meeting
shall be elected for a term running until the second annual meeting next 
succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor shall have been 
duly elected and qualified.

	Section 2.6:	Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of 
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any 
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the 
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any 
director is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be 
voted for at that meeting. The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office 
of a director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an order of court or 
convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after notice of his or her 
election, he or she does not accept the office. Any vacancy, except for a 
vacancy created by removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may 
be filled by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors 
then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining 
director. Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of 
removal of directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders. The 
shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled 
by the directors. Any such election by written consent requires the consent 
of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling
of any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been 
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the 
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more 
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to 
vote for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be 
held to elect the entire Board of Directors. The term of office of any 
director shall terminate upon such election of a successor. Any director 
may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the 
Board, if any, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or 
the Board of Directors of this corporation, unless the notice specifies 
a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is 
effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the 
resignation becomes effective. A reduction of the authorized number of 
directors shall not remove any director prior to the expiration of such 
director's term of office.

	Section 2.7:	Removal. The entire Board of Directors or any 
individual director may be removed without cause from office by an 
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; 
provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director 
shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in 
writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted 
cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be voted 
cumulatively) at an election at which the same total number of votes were 
cast, or, if such action is taken by written consent, all shares entitled to 
vote were voted, and either the number of directors elected at the most recent 
annual meeting of shareholders, or if greater, the number of directors for 
whom removal is being sought, were then being elected. If any or all 
directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting or 
at a subsequent meeting. If at any time a class or series of shares is 
entitled to elect one or more directors under authority granted by the 
Articles of Incorporation of this corporation, the provisions of this 
Section 2.7 shall apply to the vote of that class or series and not to the 
vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

	Section 2.8:	Powers and Duties.  Without limiting the generality or 
extent of the general corporate powers to be exercised by the Board of 
Directors pursuant to Section 2.1 of these By-Laws, it is hereby provided 
that the Board of Directors shall have full power with respect to the 
following matters:
				31
<PAGE>

		(a)	To purchase, lease, and acquire any and all kinds of 
property, real, personal or mixed, and at its discretion to pay therefor in 
money, in property and/or in stocks, bonds, debentures or other securities 
of this corporation.

		(b)	To enter into any and all contracts and agreements 
which in its judgment may be beneficial to the interests and purposes 
of this corporation.

		(c)	To fix and determine and to vary from time to 
time the amount or amounts to be set aside or retained as reserve funds or as 
working capital of this corporation or for maintenance, repairs, 
replacements or enlargements of its properties.

		(d)	To declare and pay dividends in cash, shares and/or 
property out of any funds of this corporation at the time legally 
available for the declaration and payment of dividends on its shares.

		(e)	To adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of 
its 
meetings and the management of the affairs of this corporation as it may 
deem proper.

		(f)	To prescribe the manner in which and the person or 
persons by whom any or all of the checks, drafts, notes, bills of exchange, 
contracts and other corporate instruments shall be executed.

		(g)	To accept resignations of directors; to declare 
vacant the office of a director as provided in Section 2.6 hereof; and, in 
case of vacancy in the office of directors, to fill the same to the extent 
provided in Section 2.6 hereof.

		(h)	To create offices in addition to those for which

for any purpose or purposes whatsoever may be called at any time 
by the President or by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members 
thereof, or by one or more holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten 
percent (10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to 
Section 10.8.  Upon request in writing sent by registered mail to the Chief 
Executive Officer, President, Vice President or Secretary, or delivered to 
any such officer in person, by any person or persons entitled to call a 
special meeting of shareholders (such request, if sent by a shareholder or 
shareholders, to include the information required by Section 10.13), 
it shall be the duty of such officer, subject to the immediately succeeding 
sentence, to cause notice to be given to the shareholders entitled to vote that
a meeting will be requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, 
the date of which meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be not less 
than 35 days nor more than 60 days after such request or, if applicable, 
determination of the validity of such request pursuant to the immediately 
succeeding sentence.  Within seven days after receiving such a written

notify the requesting party or parties of its finding.

Section 10.4:	Notice of Meetings.  Notice of any meeting of shareholders
shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the 
date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat by the 
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or other person charged with that duty, 
or if there be no such officer or person, or in case of his or her neglect 
or refusal, by any director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the 
place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, 
the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may 
be transacted, or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which 
the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to 
present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be 
presented at the meeting for such action except 
				38
<PAGE>

that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal relating to 
approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of this 
corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of 
this corporation or winding up of this corporation. The notice of any meeting 
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees 
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election. 
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either 
(i) personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, 
charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's 
address appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such 
shareholder to this corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder 
gives no address or no such address appears on the books of this 
corporation, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent by mail or 
other means of written communication addressed to the place where the 
principal executive office of this corporation is located, or if published 
at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which 
such office is located. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the 
time when delivered personally or deposited in the United States mail, 
postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication and 
addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit of delivery or mailing of 
any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed 
by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima 
facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any notice addressed to the 
shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of 
the corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal 
Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to 
deliver the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall 
be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same 
shall be available for the shareholder upon written demand of the 
shareholder at the principal executive office of this corporation for a period 
of one year from the date of the giving of the notice to all other 
shareholders.

	Section 10.5:	Consent to Shareholders' Meetings. The 
transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and 
noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly 
held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or 
by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders 
entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of 
notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the 
minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed 
with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. 
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of 
such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the 
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not 
lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a 
waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by 
law to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is 
expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the 
purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be 
specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of 
contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the 
Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation or 
winding up the affairs of this corporation.

	Section 10.6:	Quorum. The presence in person or by proxy of the 
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares 
shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such 
shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot 
be lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or 
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact 
business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of 
enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other 
than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required 
to constitute a quorum.

	Section 10.7:	Adjourned Meetings. Any shareholders' meeting, 
whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by 
the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present 
in person or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in 
Section 10.6 hereof, in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be 
transacted at such meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 
days or if after adjournment a new 
					39
<PAGE>

record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned 
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote 
at a meeting. Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any 
notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to 
be transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which 
such adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders 
may transact any business which might have been transacted at the 
original meeting.

Section 10.8:	Voting Rights. Only persons in whose names shares 
entitled to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close 
of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is 
given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day 
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be 
fixed for the determination of shareholders of record pursuant to 
Section 2.8(k) hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at 
such meeting. In the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of 
Incorporation or in any applicable statute relating to the election of 
directors or to other particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to 
one vote for each share.

In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to 
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors 
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon 
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of 
Directors, and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the 
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board 
of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders 
authorize or take corporate action by written consent or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice 
to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The 
Board of Directors shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28)
days after the date on which such request is received, adopt a resolution 
fixing the record date.

	Section 10.9:	Action by Written Consents.  Any action which may be 
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a 
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the 
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having 
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to 
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to 
vote thereon were present and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after 
receiving such written consent or consents from shareholders of the 
corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine whether holders of 
outstanding shares as of the record date established pursuant to Section 
10.8 having not less than the minimum number of votes which would be 
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares 
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted have properly consented 
thereto in writing and notify the requesting party of its finding. Unless 
the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in 
writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this 
corporation and any of its directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, 
(iii) reorganization of this corporation or (iv) distributions to shareholders 
upon winding up of this corporation in certain circumstances without a 
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 
10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by such 
approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other 
corporate action approved by shareholders without a meeting by less 
than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who 
have not consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder shall conform 
to the requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.  When 
written consents are given with respect to any shares, they shall be 
given by and accepted from the persons in whose names such shares 
stand on the books of this corporation at the time such respective consents 
are given, or any shareholder's proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or 
a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy 
holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received by this corporation 
prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to 
authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary of this 
corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  Such revocation is 
effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected 
by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all 
shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.
				40
<PAGE>
	Section 10.10: Elections of Directors. In any election of directors, 
the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the 
shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be 
elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes 
withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal
effect.  Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made 
by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.

	Section 10.11: Proxies.  Every person entitled to vote or execute 
consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more 
agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such 
person's duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this 
corporation.  No proxy shall be valid (l) after revocation thereof, unless the 
proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 
10.11 and applicable law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from 
the date thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the 
length of time for which such proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may 
be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation 
stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by 
attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the 
proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker 
unless, before the vote is counted, a written notice of such death or 
incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy which states that 
it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is 
held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following: (l) a 
pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an 
option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such 
person's shares in this corporation to the maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor 
or creditors of this corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued 
credit to this corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if 
the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or 
continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing 
the credit, (4) a person who has contracted to perform services as an 
employee of this corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of 
employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of 
such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of 
employment contracted for, (5) a person designated by or under a close 
corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement.  In addition, 
a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a 
duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of 
events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it. 
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy 
becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to 
purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of this 
corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is paid, 
the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has 
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting 
trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, 
notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares 
without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of 
the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate 
representing such shares. Every form of proxy or written consent, which 
provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect to 
any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked "abstain", 
whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her 
shares on the proposal. A proxy marked "abstain" by the shareholder 
with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for or against 
such proposal.  In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which 
the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which 
is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner 
indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld 
shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.

	Section 10.12: Inspectors of Election. Before any meeting of 
shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than 
nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its 
adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the 
Chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a 
shareholder's proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. 
The number of inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If 
inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more 
shareholders or proxies, the 
				41
<PAGE>

holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall 
determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any 
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the 
Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or 
a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.

	These inspectors shall:

		(a) 	Determine the number of shares outstanding and the 
voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the 
existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of 
proxies;

		(b)	Receive votes, ballots, or consents;

		(c)	Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any 
way arising in connection with the right to vote;

		(d)	Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

		(e)	Determine when the polls shall close;

		(f)	Determine the result; and

		(g)	Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the 
election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.
	
	Section 10.13:  Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals and Director 
Nominations.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as 
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before
a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely 
notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such
nominationor nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a 
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not 
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in 
the event less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of 
the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the 
shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of 
business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of 
the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be in proper 
written form a shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the 
name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nominations 
or propose the business and, as the case may be, of the person or persons to be 
nominated or of the business to be proposed, (ii) a representation that the 
shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation that intends to 
vote such stock at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person 
or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the 
notice, (iii) if applicable, a description of all arrangements or 
understandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any other person or 
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the 
nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such 
other information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to 
be proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a 
proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be 
nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, 
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable, the 
consent of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The 
chairman of a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the 
nomination of any person or the proposal of any business not made in 
compliance with the foregoing procedure.

			APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
		    SENIOR OFFICERS RESTRICTED 
		      PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN

1.	PURPOSE

This annual performance-based incentive plan (the "Performance 
Share Plan" or the "Plan") is designed to reward executive officers of Apple 
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") for achieving 
performance objectives. The Performance Share Plan is intended to 
provide an incentive for superior performance and to motivate 
participating officers toward even higher achievement and business 
results, to tie their goals and interests to those of the Corporation and its 
shareholders, to promote the maintenance of substantial stock 
ownership levels by officers of the Corporation, and to enable the 
Corporation to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers. 
The Performance Share Plan is also intended to secure the full deductibility 
of incentive compensation payable to the Corporation's Chief Executive 
Officer and the four highest compensated executive officers 
(collectively the "Covered Employees") whose compensation is required to be 
reported in the Corporation's proxy statement and all compensation 
payable hereunder to such persons is intended to qualify as "performance-
based compensation" as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

2.	ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

Only (i) those executive officers of the Corporation at the level of senior 
vice president or above and (ii) such other key employees of the Company as 
are recommended by management to and designated by the Compensation 
Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Performance Share 
Plan.  Prior to or at the time performance objectives are established 
for a "Performance Period", as defined below, the Compensation Committee 
(the "Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") will 
designate in writing those executive officers and other key employees 
among those who may be eligible to participate in the Plan who shall in 
fact be participants for such Performance Period (the 
"Participants").  The initial Participants in the Performance Share 
Plan shall be the individuals holding the positions identified in Appendix A.

3.	PLAN YEAR AND PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

(A) PLAN YEAR: The fiscal year of the Performance Share Plan (the "Plan 
Year") shall be the fiscal year beginning on the first day of the 
Company's fiscal year and ending on the last day of the Company's fiscal 
year. The performance period (the "Performance Period") with respect to 
which awards may be payable under the Plan shall be the Plan Year, or, in 
the event the Committee designates an employee to participate in the Plan as 
of a date that is after the beginning of the Plan Year, such shorter period as 
the Committee designates. The initial Plan Year shall commence on 
September 30, 1996 and end on September 26, 1997.

(B) PERFORMANCE GOAL SETTING PERIOD: Within the first ninety (90) 
days of each Performance Period the Committee shall establish in writing, 
with respect to such Performance Period, one or more performance goals, 
a specific target objective or objectives with respect to such performance 
goals and an objective formula or method for computing the amount of 
performance shares payable to each Participant under the Plan if the 
performance goals are attained. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, for any 
				49
<PAGE>

Performance Period, such goals, objectives and compensation formulae 
or methods must be established within that number of days, beginning on the 
first day of such Performance Period, which is no more than twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the total number of days in such Performance Period.  The 
Committee may, but shall not be required to, set performance goals for 
any Participant whose Performance Period is shorter than the Plan Year 
that are different from the performance goals for Participants 
whose Performance Period is the Plan Year, and may, but shall not be 
required to, set such separate performance goals within twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the total number of days remaining in the Plan Year at the 
time such Participants are designated as Participants in the Plan.  Any such 
separate performance goals shall be selected from among the performance 
goals listed in Section 3(C) hereof.

(C) PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT: Performance goals shall be based upon 
one or more of the following business criteria for the Company:

	 -  earnings per share

	 -  share price

	 -  revenue growth

	 -  return on equity

	 -  return on net assets

	 -  timing objectives for delivery of new products

	 -  retention of key employees

The Committee may adopt other performance goals in its sole and 
absolute discretion, provided, however, that in the event the Committee 
determines to adopt performance goals based on criteria other than those 
stated above, the Committee shall obtain shareholder approval of such 
criteria.  All performance goals adopted by the Committee shall be 
preestablished, objective performance goals as described in Reg. Sec. 1.162-
27(e)(2), promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code. Measurements of 
the Company's or a Participant's performance against the performance 
goals established by the Committee shall be objectively determinable and, 
to the extent any performance goal is expressed in standard accounting 
terms, such performance goal shall be determined according to generally 
accepted accounting principles as in existence on the date on which the 
performance goals are established and without regard to any changes in such 
principles after such date.

4.	DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

(A) SHARES COVERED BY THE PLAN: Shares awarded under the 
Performance Share Plan shall be shares of the Company's common stock 
("Shares"). The maximum number of Shares that may be awarded under the 
Plan shall be 2,000,000 in the aggregate and, in any single Plan Year, 300,000 
to any one individual, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6(k). 
Shares that are converted to cash in accordance with Section 5 shall be 
treated as shares awarded under the Plan for purposes of the aggregate and 
individual limits in the previous sentence. Any increase in the number 
of Shares allocated 
				    50
<PAGE>

to the Plan must be approved by the Company's shareholders. Any Shares 
deliverable under the Plan may be made available from authorized but 
unissued Shares or Shares reacquired by the Company, including Shares 
purchased in the open market or in private transactions.

(B) GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES: At the beginning of each Performance 
Period, each Participant will be granted the target number of Shares 
(see Appendix A) that can be earned based on performance with respect to 
that Performance Period (the "Conditional Grant"). At the time the 
Conditional Grant is made on behalf of a Participant, certificates representing 
the target number of Shares will be registered in the name of the 
Participant. During the Performance Period, the certificates representing 
those Shares will be held by the Company. The Committee may specify 
that the Conditional Grant for a Performance Period will be earned if 
the applicable target is achieved for one goal or for any one of a number of 
goals. The Committee may also provide that the Conditional Grant for a 
Performance Period will be earned only if targets are achieved for more 
than one performance goal. The Committee may also provide that the 
Conditional Grant to be earned for a given Performance Period will vary 
based upon different levels of achievement of the applicable 
performance targets.

As soon as practicable after the end of each Performance Period, the 
Committee shall certify in writing to what extent the Company and the 
Participants have achieved the performance goal or goals for such 
Performance Period, including the specific target objective or objectives 
and the satisfaction of any other material terms of the  Plan and the 
Committee shall calculate the amount of each Participant's actual award for 
such Performance Period based upon the performance goals, objectives and 
computation formulae or methods for such Performance Period (the "Actual 
Grant"). The Committee shall have no discretion to increase the maximum 
amount of any Participant's Actual Grant as so determined, but may reduce 
the amount of or totally eliminate such award, as it determines, in its 
absolute and sole discretion, in an amount appropriate to reflect the 
Participant's performance.

No Participant's Actual Grant for any Plan Year shall exceed the number of 
Shares stated in Appendix A.

Only after the Actual Grant has been awarded to a Participant will he or she 
have the rights of a shareholder in the Company with respect to any of the 
Shares covered by the Conditional Grant, including the right to vote the 
Shares and the right to receive any distributions with respect to such 
Shares.

5.	PAYMENT OF AWARDS

Approved performance share awards shall be payable by the Company to 
each Participant in Shares, or, at the election of the Participant, fifty 
percent (50%) in Shares and fifty percent (50%) in cash ("Cash 
Election"), as soon as reasonably practicable after the last day of the 
relevant Performance Period (the "vesting date"), provided that the 
Committee has first certified in writing that the relevant performance goals 
were achieved. In the event that a Participant makes a Cash Election, the 
amount of cash to be awarded shall be determined by the Committee as of each 
vesting date, such that (subject to the performance goals for that 
Performance Period being fully satisfied), the Participant receives fifty 
percent of the total value of the Shares earned as of the vesting date in cash 
and the remainder in Shares, based on the closing price of the Company's 
common stock on the vesting date.  Cash Elections for any Performance 
Period shall be made on a form 
				51
<PAGE>

provided for the purpose by the Committee within sixty (60) days of the 
date an employee is notified by the Committee that he or she has been 
designated as a Participant in the Plan for that Performance Period.  Except in 
the case of an Actual Grant made to a Participant's Beneficiary (as 
hereinafter defined), a participant is precluded from selling or otherwise 
disposing of any interest in Actual Grant Shares until such time as the 
Shares are distributed to the Participant.

If a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company prior to the end of any 
Plan Year, award payment rights will be determined as follows:

A.	Involuntary termination by the Company for cause or voluntary 
termination by a Participant would lead to a Participant's forfeiture of all 
Performance Share Plan awards for that Plan Year. Termination for cause 
is defined as follows: conviction of (i) a felony, (ii) embezzlement from the 
Company or (iii) other business fraud.

B.	Termination on account of death, disability, or involuntary 
termination not for cause by the Company entitles a Participant, or the 
Participant's Beneficiary, to a prorated share of the performance share award.  
Prorated awards are determined based on the number of completed months 
that the Participant was employed in the Performance Period divided by 12 
months (or by such lesser number of months as constitutes the Performance 
Period in the case of a Performance Period that is shorter than the Plan 
Year) and are subject to reduction as provided in Section 4(b). Prorated 
awards shall be paid at the same time as if the Participant had remained 
employed until the end of the Plan Year.

6.	OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(A) TERM OF PLAN: The Performance Share Plan shall become effective 
upon its adoption by the Board, subject to the subsequent approval thereof by 
the shareholders of the Company in accordance with Section 6(b).  It shall 
continue in effect for a term of five (5) years unless sooner terminated under 
Section 7 of the Plan.

(B) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL: No Actual Grants shall be awarded under 
the Performance Share Plan unless and until the material terms (within 
the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code) of the Plan, including the 
business criteria described in the Plan, are disclosed to the Company's 
shareholders and are approved by the shareholders by a majority of votes 
cast in person or by proxy (including abstentions to the extent abstentions 
are counted as voting under applicable state law).

(C) NO PARTICIPATION RIGHTS: No person shall have any legal claim to be 
granted an award under the Performance Share Plan and the 
Committee shall have no obligation to treat Participants uniformly. 
Participation in the Performance Share Plan in any Plan Year does not 
entitle any Participant to participate in the Plan in any other Plan Year. The 
right to receive a targeted number of performance shares in any given year 
does not entitle a Participant to participate with respect to the same 
number of Shares in any subsequent year.

(D) NO RIGHTS TO SPECIFIC PROPERTY: Except as may be otherwise required by 
law, Conditional Grants and Actual Grants under the Performance Share 
Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, 
sale, transfer, assignment, 
				      52
<PAGE>

pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any 
kind, either voluntary or involuntary. No Participant shall have any claim 
with respect to any specific assets of the Company or to stock certificates 
registered in the Participant's name prior to the vesting of the shares 
represented by such certificates.

(E) NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS: Neither the Performance Share Plan nor any 
action taken under the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right 
with respect to continuation of employment by the Company (or any 
subsidiary or affiliated company) or to maintain any Participant's 
compensation at any level, nor shall it interfere in any way with any 
Participant's right or the right of the Company (or any subsidiary or 
affiliated company) to terminate a Participant's employment at any time 
or for any reason.

(F) OTHER BENEFITS: Performance share awards shall not be considered as 
part of a Participant's salary or used for the calculation of any other pay, 
allowance, pension or other benefit unless otherwise permitted by other 
benefit plans provided by the Company or its subsidiaries, or required by law 
or by contractual obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries.

(G) BENEFICIARY: The term "Beneficiary" shall mean the person or 
persons designated by a Participant to whom performance share are to be 
paid pursuant to the terms of the Performance Share Plan in the event 
of the Participant's death. The designation shall be on a form 
provided by the Committee, executed by the Participant, and delivered to the 
Committee. A Participant may change his or her Beneficiary designation at 
any time. If no Beneficiary is designated, the designation is 
ineffective, or in the event the Beneficiary dies before the balance of the 
performance share award is paid, the balance shall be paid to the Participant's
spouse, or if there is no spouse, in equal shares to the Participant's lineal 
descendants, or if there is no surviving spouse or lineal descendant, to the 
Participant's estate.

(H) PERMANENT DISABILITY: For purposes of the Performance Share 
Plan, a permanent disability shall mean a disability which would qualify 
a Participant to receive benefits under the Apple Computer, Inc. Long-Term 
Disability Plan (after satisfying the elimination period thereunder) as now 
or hereafter in effect.

(I) INCAPACITY OF PARTICIPANT OR BENEFICIARY: If the Committee finds 
that any Participant or Beneficiary to whom a performance share award is 
payable under the Performance Share Plan is unable to care for his or her 
affairs because of illness or accident or is under a legal disability, any 
performance share award due (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been 
made by a duly appointed legal representative) at the discretion of the 
Committee, may be paid to the spouse, child, parent or brother or sister of 
such Participant or Beneficiary or to any person whom the Committee has 
determined has incurred expense for such Participant or Beneficiary. Any 
such payment shall be a complete discharge of the obligations of the 
Company under provisions of the Performance Share Plan to the extent 
of such payment.

(J) TAX WITHHOLDING: The Company will withhold from each Actual Grant 
at the time of payment thereof all applicable state, local and federal 
withholding taxes, as required by law, as determined by Apple in its sole 
discretion. Such withholding will be made first from the amount of the 
Participant's Cash Election, if any, and second from the Participant's Shares, 
to the extent required. Alternatively, in lieu of withholding from Shares, the 
Participant may elect to fund the payment of withholding taxes 
determined by Apple to be due by making payment of the full amount of 
the withholding taxes to Apple on or before the due date of the withholding 
taxes.
				     53
<PAGE>

(K) ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

If the outstanding Shares are increased, decreased, or exchanged for 
a different number of kind of shares or other securities, or if additional 
Shares or other securities are distributed with respect to such Shares or 
other securities, through merger, consolidation, sale of all or 
substantially all of the property of the Company, reorganization, 
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse 
stock split or other distribution with respect to such Shares or other 
securities, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment may be made in 
(i) the maximum number and kind of Shares provided for in Section 4(a) of 
the Plan, (ii) the annual individual maximum grant limit provided for in 
Section 4(a), (iii) the number and kind of Shares subject to each then 
outstanding performance share award, and (iv) each Participant's target 
number of Shares as provided in Appendix A.

Adjustments under this Section 6(k) will be made by the Committee, whose 
determination as to what adjustments will be made and the extent thereof 
will be final, binding and conclusive on all interested persons. No fractional 
Share or other interest will be issued under the Plan on account of any of 
such adjustments

(L) CHANGE IN CONTROL: In the event of a change in control (as defined 
below) of the Company, the Committee shall make equitable adjustments to the 
Participant's Performance Shares in a manner intended to preserve their 
economic value as of the date of the change in control, including 
modifications to performance measures and performance goals if necessary; 
provided, however, that if a Participant's employment with the 
Company is terminated without cause in connection with a change in 
control, then any other provision of the Plan to the contrary 
notwithstanding, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the maximum 
annual number of Performance Shares for the year in which the change-in-
control occurs following such termination regardless of whether the 
Performance Goals are achieved. For purposes of this Plan, change in 
control is defined as follows:

A.	When any "person", as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) 
of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a Company 
employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting as a trustee) 
is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 
Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company 
representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of 
the Company's then outstanding securities; or

B.	The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and 
involving either the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company or the merger of the Company with or into another entity.

(M) CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES: Shares shall not be issued with 
respect to an Actual Grant unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares 
pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, 
without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, 
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of 
any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may 
then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of 
counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
				     54
<PAGE>

Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body 
having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be 
necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the 
Company of any liability in respect of the non-issuance of such Shares as to 
which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

(N) GOVERNING LAW: The place of administration of the Performance 
Share Plan shall be in the State of California and the validity, 
construction, interpretation, administration and effect of the 
Performance Share Plan and the rules, regulations and rights relating to the 
Performance Share Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California.

7.	ADMINISTRATION

(A) ADMINISTRATOR: The Plan shall be administered by a Committee 
designated by the Board to administer the Plan, which Committee shall be 
constituted in such a manner as to permit the Plan and grants and awards 
thereunder to comply with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to grants to officers and
in such a manner as to satisfy the Applicable Laws.  All members of the 
Committee shall be persons who qualify as "outside directors" as defined 
under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Until changed by the Board, the Compensation
Committee of the Board shall constitute the Committee hereunder.

(B) POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR: The Committee shall have full power, 
authority and discretion to administer and interpret the provisions of the 
Performance Share Plan and to adopt such rules, regulations, agreements, 
guidelines and instruments for the administration of the Plan and for the 
conduct of its business as the Committee deems necessary or 
advisable. Without limitation of the foregoing, subject to the provisions of 
the Plan and such limitations as are necessary or desirable in order for 
incentive awards paid to Covered Employees to constitute qualified 
performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the 
Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to determine the 
amount of cash to be awarded pursuant to any Cash Election under Section 5 
above; (ii) to determine the employees who shall be Participants in the Plan; 
(iii) to interpret the Plan; (iv) to determine the terms and conditions, 
not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Conditional Grant or 
Actual Grant awarded hereunder (including, but not limited to, any 
restriction or limitation, or any waiver of forfeiture restrictions regarding 
any Grant and/or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such 
factors as the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (v) to 
approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vi) to prescribe, 
amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (vii) 
to modify or amend each Grant (with the consent of the Participant); (viii) 
to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument 
required to effectuate any Grant previously granted by the 
Administrator; and (ix) to make all other determinations deemed 
necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

(C) EFFECT OF DECISIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATOR: All decisions, 
determinations and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and 
binding on all Participants.

8.	AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as 
it may deem advisable; provided that except as otherwise required by law, 
any amendment required to conform the Performance Share Plan to the 
requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code or to conform the Performance 
Share Plan or any grant made thereunder to the requirements for 
exemption under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto ("Rule 16b-3"), 
shall be made by the Committee, and provided that, to the extent necessary 
and desirable to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code (or any other 
applicable law, regulations or rules), the Company shall obtain shareholder 
approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as 
is required, including, without limitation, any amendment to the class 
of individuals who are eligible to participate in the Performance Share 
Plan, to the performance criteria specified in Section 2 hereof or to the 
maximum incentive award payable to any Participant, unless shareholder 
approval is not required in order for incentive awards paid to Covered 
Employees to constitute qualified performance-based compensation 
under Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such amendment, alteration, 
suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair the rights of any 
Plan Participant under any grant theretofore made without his or her 
consent.  Such grants shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan 
had not been amended or terminated, except as may otherwise be required by 
applicable law.

EXHIBIT 10.A.44
				Apple Computer, Inc.
			Non-Employee Director Stock Plan


			   (Effective March 25, 1997)

		1.	Purposes.  The purposes of the Plan are (i) to retain 
the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company 
to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of 
the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such 
individuals by granting such individuals Options to purchase shares 
of Common Stock and (ii) to provide such individuals an opportunity to 
defer payment of a portion of their Director's Fees in accordance with the 
terms and conditions set forth herein. 

		2.	Administration.  
The Administrator will be responsible for administering the Plan.  The 
Administrator will have authority to adopt such rules as it may deem 
appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan, and shall have authority to 
interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and any agreements and 
notices under the Plan and to make determinations pursuant to any Plan 
provision.  Each interpretation, determination or other action made or 
taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on 
all persons.  The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or 
determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and 
reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company's Articles of 
Incorporation and By-Laws as such documents may be amended from time 
to time.

		3.	Shares Available.

		Subject to the provisions of Section 8(b) of the Plan, the 
maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the 
Plan shall not exceed 700,000  shares (the "Section 3 Limit"). Either 
authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock or treasury shares may 
be delivered pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of determining the number 
of shares that remain available for issuance under the Plan, the following 
rules shall apply:

		a)	the number of outstanding Phantom Stock Units and 
shares of Common Stock underlying Options shall be charged against the 
Section 3 Limit; and

		(b)	the Section 3 Limit shall be increased by (A) the 
number of shares subject to an Option which lapses, expires or is otherwise 
terminated without the issuance of such shares, and (B) the number of 
shares tendered to pay the exercise price of an Option.
		
		4.	Options.  Each Non-Employee Director shall receive 
grants of Options under the Plan as follows:

		(a)	Option Grants.

	(i)	Initial Grant.  On the date of a Non-Employee Director's 
initial election or appointment to the Board (or, in the case of Non-Employee 
Directors who were members of the Board on the Effective Date, on the 
Effective Date), such Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee 
Director reelected or reappointed after a period of at least 12 calendar months 
during which he did not serve on the Board) shall be granted an Option to 
purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock.  Such Option shall have a per 
share exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
determined as of the date of grant and shall be subject to the vesting schedule 
provided for in Section 4(b) and the other terms and conditions provided 
for herein. The provisions of this Section 4(a)(i) shall not apply to any 
member of the Board who first becomes a Non-Employee Director by reason of 
such member's ceasing to be an employee of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries.
				      58
<PAGE>

	(ii)	Annual Grants.  At each Annual Meeting occurring after the 
Effective Date and during the term of the Plan, each individual who has 
continuously served as a Non-Employee Director for a period ending on the 
date of such Annual Meeting and who is reelected at such Annual Meeting or 
who will otherwise continue to serve on the Board following such Annual 
Meeting will receive an Option to purchase that number of shares of 
Common Stock equal to the sum of "A" plus "B", where "A" equals 7,500, and 
"B" equals the product obtained by multiplying 3,500 by the number of 
committees of the Board for which the Non-Employee Director is either 
elected or appointed as of the date of the Annual Meeting to serve as 
chairperson for the upcoming year.  The Option shall have a per share 
exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock determined 
as of the date of grant and shall be subject to the vesting schedule 
provided for in Section 4(b) and the other terms and conditions provided 
for herein.

		(b)	Vesting Schedule of Options.  Options awarded pursuant
to the Plan shall vest and become exercisable in equal annual 
installments on each of the first through third anniversaries (each, a 
"Vesting Date") of the date of grant of the Option; provided, however, that if 
(i) a Non-Employee Director is not renominated for election to the Board 
at an Annual Meeting at which such director's term is scheduled to expire, 
(ii) the NonEmployee Director serves as a Non-Employee Director through the 
date of such Annual Meeting and (iii) the next scheduled Vesting Date of any 
Option granted to such NonEmployee Director falls within the three-month 
period following the date of such Annual Meeting, then such Vesting 
Date shall be deemed for purposes of the Plan and each such Option to have 
occurred on the day immediately prior to the date of such Annual Meeting. 
Any fractional share which results from the application of the foregoing 
vesting schedule shall vest in the final vesting installment.  In addition, if 
a Non-Employee Director's service with the Board terminates as a result of such 
Non-Employee Director's death, then, as of the date of death, all Options 
previously granted to such Non-Employee Director shall become fully 
and immediately vested and exercisable.

		(c)	Term of Options. 

	(i)	Ten-Year Term.  Each Option shall expire ten years from its 
date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.

	(ii)  	Exercise Following Termination of Service Due to Death.  If 
a NonEmployee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of such 
NonEmployee Director's death, the Options granted to such Non-Employee 
Director may be exercised by such Non-Employee Director's Beneficiary at 
any time within three years after the date of such termination of service, 
subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 
4(c)(i) above.  At the end of such three-year period, the vested portion 
of the Option shall expire.

	(iii)	Termination of Options if a Non-Employee Director is Removed 
from the Board for Cause.  In the event a Non-Employee Director is removed 
from the Board for "cause," all Options granted to such Non-Employee Director 
(whether or not then vested and exercisable) shall immediately 
terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the effective date of 
such removal from the Board. Whether a Non-Employee Director is removed by 
the Board for "cause" shall be determined by the Board in accordance 
with the By-Laws of the Company.

	(iv)  	Exercise Following Other Terminations of Service.  If a Non-
Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason 
other than death or removal from the Board for cause, then (A) the Non-
Employee Director shall have the right, subject to the terms and conditions 
hereof, to exercise the Option, at any time within ninety days after the date 
of such termination, subject to the earlier expiration of the Option as 
provided for in Section 4(c)(i) above, but only to the extent that such Option 
				      59
<PAGE>

was exercisable by the Non-Employee Director on the date of such 
termination. The unvested portion of the Option shall expire on the date of 
the Non-Employee Director's termination of service with the Board.  At the
end of such ninety-day period, the vested portion of the Option shall expire.

		(d)	Time and Manner of Exercise of Options.

	(i)	Notice of Exercise.  Subject to the other terms and 
conditions hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Options, to 
the extent such Options arevested, by giving written notice of exercise to the 
Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be exercisable 
for a fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later 
of (A) the date on which the Company receives such written notice and (B) 
the date on which the conditions provided in Section 4(d)(ii) are 
satisfied.
		
	(ii)  	Payment.  Subject to the last three sentences of this Section 
4(d)(ii), prior to the issuance of a certificate pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) 
hereof evidencing the shares of Common Stock in respect of which all 
or a portion of an Option shall have been exercised, a Non-Employee 
Director shall have paid to the Company the exercise price of the 
Option for all such shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of such Option.  
Payment may be made by personal check, bank draft or postal or express 
money order (such modes of payment are collectively referred to as "cash") 
payable to the order of the Company in U.S. dollars, or in shares of Common 
Stock already owned by the Non-Employee Director for at least six 
months at the time of exercise valued at their Fair Market Value as of the last 
business day preceding the date of exercise, or in a combination of cash or 
such shares. Payment of the exercise price in shares of Common Stock shall 
be made by delivering to the Company the share certificate(s) representing 
the required number of shares, with the NonEmployee Director signing his 
or her name on the back, or by attaching executed stock powers (the 
signature of the Non-Employee Director must be guaranteed in either 
case).  In addition to the exercise methods described above, a Non-
Employee Director may exercise an Option through a "cashless exercise" 
procedure whereby the Non-Employee Director delivers to the Company an 
irrevocable notice of exercise in exchange for the Company issuing the 
shares of Common Stock subject to the Option to a broker previously 
designated or approved by the Company.  Such broker will 
immediately sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock on behalf of 
the Non-Employee Director to pay the exercise price of the Option and shall 
remit the amount of the exercise price to the Company in cash from the sales 
proceeds and deliver the balance, if any, of the sales proceeds (net of 
commissions) to such NonEmployee Director.  Any shares not sold by the 
broker shall be delivered to the NonEmployee Director in the manner 
contemplated by Section 4(d)(v) below.

	(iii)  	Stockholder Rights.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no 
rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock issuable 
upon exercise of an Option until a certificate evidencing such shares 
shall have been issued to the NonEmployee Director pursuant to 
Section 4(d)(v), and no adjustment shall be made for dividends or 
distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date 
is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become 
the holder of record thereof.	

	(iv)  	Limitation on Exercise.  No Option shall be exercisable unless 
the Common Stock subject thereto has been registered under the Securities 
Act and qualified under applicable state "blue sky" laws in connection 
with the offer and sale thereof, or the Company has determined that an 
exemption from registration under the Securities Act and from qualification 
under such state "blue sky" laws is available.

	(v)  	Issuance of Shares.  Subject to the foregoing conditions, as 
soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of 
exercise and payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of 
shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall 
deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee 
Director's death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the 
principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be 
acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such 
Beneficiary), one or more stock certificates for the appropriate number 
of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with such exercise.  
Shares sold in connection with a "cashless exercise" shall be delivered to 
the broker designated or appointed by the Company in the time and manner 
described in Section 4(d)(ii) above.  Any such shares shall be fully paid and
nonassessable.

		(e)	Restrictions on Transfer.  An Option may not be 
transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or 
by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that the 
Administrator may, subject to such terms and conditions as the 
Administrator shall specify, permit the transfer of an Option to a Non-
Employee Director's family members or to one or more trusts established in 
whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.  The 
Option shall be exercisable, during the NonEmployee Director's lifetime, only 
by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the 
Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous 
sentence.  No assignment or transfer of the Option, or of the rights 
represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or 
otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest 
in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Option, but 
immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Option the same shall 
terminate and be of no force or effect.

		5.	Deferral of 
Director's Fees.

		(a)	Deferral Elections.

	(i)	General Provisions.  Non-Employee Directors may elect to defer 
all or a specified percentage of their Director's Fees with respect to a 
Deferral Period in the manner provided in this Section 5.  A Non-
Employee Director's Deferred Benefit is at all times nonforfeitable.
	
	(ii)  	Deferral Election Forms.  Before the Election Date applicable 
to a Deferral Period, each Non-Employee Director will be provided with a 
Deferral Election Form and a Beneficiary Designation Form.  In 
order for a Non-Employee Director to participate in the deferral portion of 
the Plan for a given Deferral Period, a Deferral Election Form, completed and 
signed by him, must be delivered to the Company on or prior to the applicable 
Election Date.  A Non-Employee Director electing to participate in the 
Plan for a given Deferral Period shall indicate on his Deferral Election Form:

	     	(A)	the percentage of the Director's Fees for the Deferral 
Period to be deferred;

		(B)	if the Deferral Election Form is the first such form 
filed by the Non-Employee Director, the Non-Employee Director's election, 
in accordance with Sections 5(f) and 5(g), as to the timing and manner of 
payment of the Deferred Benefits.  A Non-Employee Director's election as to 
the timing and manner of payment of Deferred Benefits in the initial 
Deferral Election Form shall govern the timing and manner of payment of 
all subsequent deferrals under the Plan and may not be changed or 
revoked without the prior written consent of the Administrator; and 

		(C)	whether amounts deferred for the Deferral Period will 
be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account as Phantom Stock Units in 
accordance with Section 5(b) below or Phantom Cash Amounts in accordance 
with Section 5(c) below.  A Non-Employee Director's election as to the 
method of crediting deferred 
				      61
<PAGE>

amounts for a given Deferral Period may not be subsequently changed or 
revoked.  Director's Fees for a given Deferral Period may be deferred in 
part in Phantom Cash Amounts and in part in Phantom Stock Units.  Any such 
allocation shall be in multiples of 10% (not to exceed 100%) of the amounts 
deferred. 

	(iii)  	Effect of No Deferral Election.  A Non-Employee Director 
who does not submit a completed and signed Deferral Election Form to the 
Company on or prior to the applicable Election Date may not defer his 
Director's Fees for the Deferral Period.

		(b)	Establishment of Deferred Compensation Accounts.  A 
Non-Employee Director's deferrals will be credited to a Deferred Compensation 
Account set up for that Non-Employee Director by the Company in accordance 
with the provisions of this Section 5.

		(c)	Crediting of Phantom Cash Amounts to Deferred 
Compensation Accounts.  The portion of the Director's Fees that a Non-Employee 
Director elects to deferin the form of Phantom Cash Amounts shall be 
credited to the Deferred Compensation Account as of the last business day of 
the fiscal quarter in which such portion of the Director's Fees would 
otherwise have been payable to the Non-Employee Director.  The Phantom 
Cash Amount credited to the Deferred Compensation Account shall thereafter 
be credited with notional interest as of the last day of each month.  The 
annual rate of interest in effect for a Deferral Period shall be the 
"applicable federal rate" for short-term loans with monthly compounding, as 
promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service under Section 1274 of the Internal
Revenue Code for the first month in such Deferral Period. 

		(d)	Crediting of Phantom Stock Units to Deferred 
Compensation Accounts. 

	(i)	Number of Phantom Stock Units.  The portion of the Director's 
Fees that a Non-Employee Director elects to defer in the form of Phantom 
Stock Units shall be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account as of 
the last business day of the fiscal quarter in which such portion of the 
Director's Fees would otherwise have been payable to the Non-Employee 
Director.  The number of Phantom Stock Units to be credited to the 
Deferred Compensation Account shall be determined by dividing (1) the 
amount of the Director's Fees deferred over such quarter by (2) the Fair 
Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of crediting.  Any 
partial Phantom Stock Unit that results from the application of the previous 
sentence shall be rounded up to a whole Phantom Stock Unit.

	(ii)	Dividend Equivalents.  In the event that the Company pays any 
cash or other dividend or makes any other distribution in respect of the 
Common Stock, each Phantom Stock Unit credited to the Deferred 
Compensation Account of a NonEmployee Director will be credited 
with an additional number of Phantom Stock Units (including fractions 
thereof) determined by dividing (A) the amount of cash, or the value (as 
determined by the Administrator) of any securities or other property, paid 
or distributed in respect of one outstanding share of Common Stock by 
(B) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of such 
payment or distribution.  Any partial Phantom Stock Unit that results from 
the application of the previous sentence shall be rounded up to a 
whole Phantom Stock Unit.  Such credit shall be made effective as of the date
of the dividend or other distribution in respect of the Common Stock.

	(iii)	No Rights as Stockholder.  The crediting of Phantom Stock Units 
to a Non-Employee Director's Deferred Compensation Account shall not confer on 
the Non-Employee Director any rights as a stockholder of the Company. 

		(e)	Written Statements of Account. The Company will furnish 
each NonEmployee Director with a statement setting forth the value of 
such Non-Employee Director's Deferred Compensation Account as of the end of 
each Deferral Period and all credits to and 
				      62
<PAGE>

payments from the Deferred Compensation Account during the Deferral Period.  
Such statement will be furnished no later than 60 days after the end of the 
Deferral Period.

		(f)  	Manner of Payment of Deferred Benefit.  Payment 
of the portion of the Deferred Benefits under the Plan credited as Phantom 
Cash Amounts shall be in cash and payment of the portion of the Deferred 
Benefits credited in Phantom Stock Units shall be in shares of Common 
Stock.  Payment shall be made either in a single lump sum or in a series of 
five or fewer annual installments.  The amount of each installment payment to 
a NonEmployee Director shall be determined in accordance with the 
formula B/(N - P), where "B" is the total value of the Deferred 
Compensation Account as of the installment calculation date, "N" is the 
number of installments elected by the Non-Employee Director and "P" is the 
number of installments previously paid to the Non-Employee Director.  If a 
Non-Employee Director's Deferred Benefit is credited in part in Phantom 
Cash Amounts and in part in Phantom Stock Units and the Non-Employee 
Director elects the payment of Deferred Benefits in more than one installment, 
then the formula in the previous sentence shall be applied separately 
with respect to each such portion of the Deferred Compensation Account.

		(g)  	Commencement of Payment of Deferred Benefit.  Payment 
of a NonEmployee Director's Deferred Benefit shall commence as soon as 
practicable (but in no event more than 60 days) after the earlier to occur of:

	(i) 	termination of service as a member of the Board; and

    	(ii)  	the date specified in the Deferral Election Form executed by the 
	NonEmployee Director.

		(h)  	Death.  In the event of a Non-Employee Director's death, 
the NonEmployee Director's entire Deferred Benefit (including any unpaid
 portion thereof corresponding to installments not yet paid at the time 
of death), to the extent not distributed earlier pursuant to Section 5(g), 
will be distributed in a lump sum to the Non-Employee Director's Beneficiary as 
soon as practicable after the date of death, but in no event more than six 
months after the Non-Employee Director's date of death.

		(i)	Restrictions on Transfer.  The Company shall pay all 
Deferred Benefits payable under the Plan only to the Non-Employee 
Director or Beneficiary designated under the Plan to receive such 
amounts.  Neither a Non-Employee Director nor his Beneficiary shall have 
any right to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or 
change any benefits to which he may become entitled under the Plan, and 
any attempt to do so shall be void.  A Deferred Benefit shall not be subject to 
attachment, execution by levy, garnishment, or other legal or 
equitable process for a Non-Employee Director's or Beneficiary's debts or 
other obligations.
		
		6.	Designation of Beneficiary.

		(a)  	Beneficiary Designations.  Each Non-Employee 
Director may designate a Beneficiary to receive any Deferred Benefit due 
under the Plan or to exercise an Option upon the Non-Employee Director's 
death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form.  

		(b)  	Change of Beneficiary Designation.  A Non-
Employee Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by 
executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to 
the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its 
receipt by the Administrator revokes and rescinds any prior Beneficiary 
Designation Form.





				     63

		7.	Change in Control.

		Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the 
event of a Change in Control of the Company, the following provisions 
shall apply:

		(a)	Any Options outstanding as of the date such Change 
in Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable 
and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested.

		(b)	The value of all outstanding Options (to the extent 
not previously exercised) shall be cashed out on the date of the Change in 
Control.  The amount at which such Options shall be cashed out shall be 
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Change in Control Price over (ii) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option.  The cash-out 
proceeds shall be paid to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event of 
death of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary 
thereof.

		(c)	All Deferred Benefits credited to the Non-Employee 
Director's Deferred Compensation Account as of the date of the Change in 
Control shall be paid in cash to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event 
of death of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary 
thereof on the date of the Change in Control.  The cash amount paid for each 
whole or partial Phantom Stock Unit shall be the Change in Control Price.

		(d)	If the Administrator shall receive an opinion 
from a nationally recognized firm of accountants to the Company that the 
cash-out provisions in Section 7(b) above with respect to Options or the 
payment of Phantom Stock Units in cash by the Company in accordance 
with Section 7(c) above will prohibit the utilization of "pooling of interests" 
accounting in connection with the transaction resulting in the Change in 
Control of the Company, then the following shall apply, but only to the 
extent necessary to permit such accounting treatment:  (i) (A) the 
provisions of Section 7(b) shall not apply to the Options,(B) each such 
Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable as of the date such 
opinion is received by the Administrator, and (C) the 
Administrator shall promptly inform each Non-Employee Director of such 
opinion and of the accelerated vesting and exercisability of the Option 
sufficiently prior to the anticipated date of the Change in Control so as to 
permit the Options to be exercised prior to the date of the Change in Control, 
and (ii) the Phantom Stock Units shall be settled in shares of Common Stock 
on the date that such opinion is received by the Administrator.  

		8.	Recapitalization or Reorganization.

		(a)	Authority of the Company and Shareholders.  The 
existence of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or 
power of the Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize 
any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the 
Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation 
of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to 
purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks 
whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof 
or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the 
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all 
or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or 
proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

		(b)	Change in Capitalization.  Notwithstanding any 
other provision of the Plan, in the event of any change in the 
outstanding Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, 
reorganization, merger, consolidation, stock split, combination or exchange of 
shares (a "Change in Capitalization"), (i) such proportionate adjustments as 
may be necessary (in the form determined by the Administrator in its 
sole discretion) to reflect such change shall be made to prevent dilution or 
enlargement of the rights of Non-Employee Directors under the Plan with respect 
to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock authorized to be awarded 
under the Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each 
outstanding Option and the exercise prices in respect thereof, the  
				     64
<PAGE>


number of shares of Common Stock covered by future Option grants and 
the number of Phantom Stock Units credited to a Non-Employee Director's 
Deferred Compensation Account and (ii) the Administrator may make such 
other adjustments, consistent with the foregoing, as it deems appropriate in 
its sole discretion.

		(c)	Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the 
proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each outstanding Option 
will vest and become exercisable on a date prior to the consummation of the 
proposed action that is reasonably sufficient to enable the Non-Employee 
Directors to exercise their Options.  All Deferred Benefits credited to the 
Non-Employee Director's Deferred Compensation Account as of the date of 
the consummation of a proposed dissolution or liquidation shall be paid 
in cash to the NonEmployee Director or, in the event of death of the Non-
Employee Director prior to payment,to the Beneficiary thereof on the date of 
the consummation of such proposed action.  The cash amount paid for each 
whole or partial Phantom Stock Unit shall be the Fair Market Value of a 
share of Common Stock as of the date of the consummation of such proposed 
action.

		9.	Termination and Amendment of the Plan.  

		(a)	Termination.  The Plan shall terminate on the tenth 
anniversary of the Effective Date.  Following the Effective Date, no 
further grants of Options shall be made pursuant to the Plan and no further 
Director's Fees may be deferred by a Non-Employee Director. 

		(b)	General Power of Board.  Notwithstanding anything 
herein to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time 
terminate, modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part; provided, 
however, that no such termination, modification, suspension or 
amendment shall be effective without shareholder approval if such approval 
is required to comply with any applicable law or stock exchange rule; 
and provided further, that the Board may not, without shareholder 
approval, increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the 
Plan except as provided in Section 8(b) above. 

		(c)	When Non-Employee Directors' Consents Required.  
The Board may not alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan without 
the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action 
would (i) adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Options that have 
previously been granted or (ii) result in the distribution to such 
NonEmployee Director of amounts then credited to his Deferred Compensation 
Account in any manner other than as provided in the Plan or could 
reasonably be expected to result in the immediate taxation to such Non-
Employee Director of Deferred Benefits.

		10.	Miscellaneous.

		(a)	No Right to Reelection.  Nothing in the Plan shall 
be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any 
of its members for reelection by the Company's stockholders, nor confer 
upon any Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board 
for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.

		(b)	Unfunded Plan.  

	(i)	Generally.  This Plan is unfunded.  Amounts payable under the 
Plan will be satisfied solely out of the general assets of the Company subject 
to the claims of the Company's creditors.
	
	(ii)	Deferred Benefits.  A Deferred Benefit represents at all times 
an unfunded and unsecured contractual obligation of the Company and each 
Non-Employee Director or Beneficiary will be an unsecured creditor of 
the Company.  No Non-Employee Director, Beneficiary or any other person shall 
have any interest in any fund or in any specific asset of the Company by reason 
of any amount credited to him hereunder, nor shall any Non-Employee Director, 
Beneficiary or any other person have any right to 
				      65
<PAGE>

receive any distribution under the Plan except as, and to the extent, 
expressly provided in the Plan. The Company will not segregate any funds 
or assets for Deferred Benefits or issue any notes or security for the payment 
of any Deferred Benefits.  Any reserve or other asset that the Company may 
establish or acquire to assure itself of the funds to provide benefits under 
the Plan shall not serve in any way as security to any Non-Employee Director, 
Beneficiary or other person for the performance of the Company under 
the Plan.

		(c)	Other Compensation Arrangements.  Benefits 
received by a NonEmployee Director pursuant to the provisions of the Plan 
shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of benefits 
under any other arrangement provided by the Company.

		(d)	Securities Law Restrictions.  The Administrator may 
require each NonEmployee Director purchasing or acquiring shares of 
Common Stock pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing 
that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the shares for investment 
and not with a view to the distribution thereof.  All certificates for shares 
of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-
transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem 
advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common 
Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and 
the Administrator may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such 
certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.  No 
shares of Common Stock shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall 
have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an 
exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.

		(e)	Expenses.  The costs and expenses of administering the 
Plan shall be borne by the Company.

		(f)	Applicable Law.  Except as to matters of federal law, 
the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to 
conflicts of law principles.

		(g)	Effective Date.  The Plan shall be effective as of the 
Effective Date, subject to the approval thereof by the stockholders of the 
Company by no later than the next Annual Meeting to occur after the 
Effective Date.  If such stockholder approval is notobtained by the date of 
such Annual Meeting, (i) all prior Option grants shall be void ab initio 
and of no further force and effect, and (ii) all Director's Fees previously 
deferred under the Plan (together with notional interest credited at the rate 
described in the last sentence of Section 5(c) above) shall be paid to the 
Non-Employee Director in cash within ten days following the date of the 
Annual Meeting.

APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)


1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the 
Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim
results have been included. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature
unless specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual 
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 27, 1996, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended September 27, 1996 (the 1996 Form 10-K).


2.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations. The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the Company's 
adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a net 
charge of $179 million after subsequent adjustments recorded in the fourth 
quarter of 1996. In the second quarter of 1997, the Company announced and 
began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing 
objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $155 million charge in the 
second quarter for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. The 
restructuring actions consist of terminating approximately 3,500 full-time 
employees, approximately 2,100 of whom have been terminated from the second
quarter of 1996 through March 28, 1997, excluding employees who were hired by
SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the purchasers of the Company's 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility and the Napa, California data 
center facility, respectively; canceling or vacating certain facility leases 
as a result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, 
buildings and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations 
and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts for 
projects and technologies that are not central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The restructuring actions under the plan have resulted in cash 
expenditures of $79 million and noncash asset write-downs of $28 million from 
the second quarter of 1996 through March 28, 1997. The Company expects that 
the remaining $227 million accrued balance at March 28, 1997 will result in 
cash expenditures of approximately $170 million over the next twelve months
and $11 million thereafter. The Company expects that most of the contemplated 
restructuring actions related to the plan will be completed within the next 
six months and will be financed through current working capital and continued 
short-term borrowings.

Redwood City, California, had developed, marketed and supported 
software that enables customers to easily and quickly implement business 
applications on the Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-
wide client/server networks. The total purchase price was $424 million and 
was comprised of cash payments of $319 million and the issuance of 1.5 
million shares of the Company's common stock to the NeXT shareholders 
valued at approximately $25 million according to the terms of the purchase 
agreement; the issuance of approximately 1.8 million options to 
purchase the Company's common stock to the NeXT optionholders valued at 
approximately $16 million based on the difference between the exercise price 
of the options and the market value of the Company's stock on the date the 
options were  granted; cash payments of $56 million to the NeXT debtholders; 
and cash payments of $8 million for closing and related costs. The acquisition 
was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results 
pertaining to NeXT subsequent to the date of acquisition have been included 
in the Company's consolidated operating results. The excess purchase price
over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was $422 million of 
which $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and 
development and $47 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible 
assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged to 
operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other intangible assets are 
being amortized on a straight-line basis over 2 to 7 years. The purchase price 
allocation is based on preliminary estimates of the fair value of the acquired 
net assets and in-process research and development and may be subject to 
adjustment as management completes its evaluation of the technology 
acquired and additional information becomes available during 1997.

	The following unaudited proforma summary combines the 
consolidated results of operations of the Company and NeXT as if the 
acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the three and six months 
ended March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996, after giving effect to certain 
adjustments, including in-process research and development, 
amortization of intangible assets, lower interest income as a result of lower 
cash investment balances, and lower interest expense as a result of the 
settlement of the NeXT debt, and related income tax effects. The proforma 
summary does not necessarily reflect the results of operations as they would 
have been had the Company and NeXT been combined as of the beginning of 
such periods.

4.	In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share"
("FAS 128"). Under the provisions of FAS 128, primary earnings per share will
be replaced with basic earnings per share, and fully diluted earnings per 
share will be replaced with  diluted earnings per share for companies with 
potentially dilutive securities such as outstanding options and convertible 
debt. FAS 128 is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December
15, 1997 and will require restatement of all comparative per share amounts. 
The basic loss per share will be no different than the primary loss per share 
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as 
neither consider outstanding options or convertible debt. If and when the 
Company becomes profitable, it will be required to present both basic and 
diluted earnings per share.  Basic earnings per share, which does not consider 
potentially dilutive securities, will be greater than the replaced primary 
earnings per share which did consider those securities. In addition, diluted 
earnings per share will not differ materially from the replaced fully 
diluted earnings per share.

Overview

During the second quarter of 1997, the Company continued to experience 
declines in net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer 
market. Faced with this continued decline in demand and the resulting 
continued operating losses, coupled with intense price competition 
throughout the industry, the Company announced and began to effect 
supplemental restructuring actions, including significant additional 
headcount reductions, in order to reduce costs and return the Company to 
sustainable profitability. In addition, the Company completed its acquisition 
of NeXT. The Company plans to develop and market a new operating system 
("OS") based on its Mac OS and NeXT software technologies.

Net Sales

Q2 97 compared with Q2 96

Net sales decreased 27% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 33% and 44%, respectively, in the second quarter of 
1997, compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a decline in 
worldwide demand for most product families, especially the Performa(R) and 
Power Macintosh(R) lines of consumer-oriented products, which the Company 
believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the 
Company's strategic direction, financial condition, future prospects 
and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures 
in the marketplace. In addition, Macintosh unit sales were negatively 
affected as a result of the Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders 
of Power Macintosh products due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities 
of certain components and product transition constraints. The average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased 9% in the second quarter of 
1997 compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a shift in mix 
toward the Company's newer and higher priced PowerBook(R) and Power Macintosh
products, partially offset by continued pricing actions, including 
rebates, across the Performa and other product lines in an effort to stimulate 
demand. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product 
increased 22% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 
1996, as a result of a shift in mix toward the Company's newer and higher
priced products, partially offset by continued pricing actions, including 
rebates, across most product lines in an effort to stimulate demand.  The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit and per peripheral 
unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of 
factors, including industrywide pricing pressures, increased 
competition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products.

International net sales represented 49% of total net sales in the second 
quarter of 1997 compared with 59% in the same period of 1996. International 
net sales declined 39% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Net sales in both European markets and Japan decreased 
during the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same period in 1996, 
as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an 
increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 9% in the second quarter of 1997, over the 
comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products, partially offset by increases in the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit.

According to industry sources, in the second quarter of 1997 compared with 
the comparable period of 1996, the Company's approximate share of the 
worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 3.1% from 5.8% and 
to 4.0% from 7.3%, respectively. In addition, the Company believes that its 
licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer market increased to 
approximately 0.3% from approximately 0.1%.

Six Months Ended March 28, 1997 compared with Six Months Ended 
March 29, 1996

Net sales decreased 30% in the first six months of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral 
unit sales decreased 30% and 34%, respectively, in the first six months of 
1997, compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a decline in 
worldwide demand for most product families, especially the Performa line 
of consumer-oriented products, which the Company believes was due 
principally to customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic 
direction, financial condition, future prospects and the viability of the 
Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. In 
addition, Macintosh unit sales were negatively affected as a result of the 
Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders of Power Macintosh 
products due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain 
components and product transition constraints. The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh unit decreased 3% in the first six months of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to continued pricing 
actions, including rebates, across most product lines in an effort to 
stimulate demand, partially offset by a shift in mix toward higher priced 
PowerBook and Power Macintosh products. The average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral product increased 15% in the first six months of 1997 compared 
with the same period of 1996, as a result of a shift in mix toward the 
Company's newer and higher priced products, partially offset by continued 
pricing actions, including rebates, across most product lines in an effort 
to stimulate demand.

International net sales represented 53% of total net sales in the first six 
months of 1997 compared with 54% in the same period of 1996. International 
net sales declined 31% in the first six months of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased 
during the first six months of 1997 compared with the same period in 1996, 
as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an 
increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 29% in the first six months of 1997, over the 
comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products and a slight decrease in the average 
aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the 
average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.

Q2 97 compared with Q1 97 

Net sales decreased 25% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first 
quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 35% in 
the second quarter of 1997 compared with the prior quarter primarily as a 
result of a decline in unit sales of Performa and Power Macintosh 
products, which the Company believes was due principally to customer 
concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition, 
future prospects and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to 
competitive pressures in the marketplace, as well as the seasonal 
decline in unit sales and a reduction in channel inventory levels from the 
first quarter to the second quarter, partially offset by an increase in unit 
sales of PowerBook products as a result of new product introductions which 
satisfied pent-up demand. Power Macintosh unit sales were negatively 
affected as a result of the Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders 
due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain components and 
product transition constraints. Unit sales of peripheral products decreased 
38% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 
1997. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and peripheral unit 
increased 14% and 11%, respectively, in the second quarter of 1997 compared 
with the first quarter of 1997, primarily due to a shift in product mix 
toward the Company's newer and higher priced products.

<PAGE> 

International net sales represented 49% of total net sales in the second 
quarter of 1997, compared with 56% in the first quarter of 1997. International 
net sales decreased 34% in the second quarter compared with the first 
quarter of 1997. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased during 
the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 1997, as a result of 
decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an increase in the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. 

Domestic net sales declined 13% in the second quarter of 1997 compared with 
the prior quarter, due to decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
partially offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh and peripheral unit.

According to industry sources, in the second quarter of 1997 compared with 
the first quarter of 1997, the Company's share of the worldwide and U.S. 
personal computer markets declined to 3.1% from 4.3%, and to 4.0% from 5.2%, 
respectively. In addition, the Company believes that its licensees' share of 
the worldwide personal computer market decreased to approximately 0.3% from 
approximately 0.5%.

In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed 
basis. Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates 
depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders ("backlog") 
can be, and often are, canceled at will. The Company attempts to fill orders 
on the requested delivery schedules. The Company's backlog decreased to 
approximately $409 million at May 2, 1997, from approximately $454 million 
at January 31, 1997, primarily due to a decrease in backlog of PowerBook 
product as a result of satisfying pent-up demand, partially offset by an 
increase in backlog of Power Macintosh product due to the 
Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders, as discussed above.

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at 
any particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its future 
business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation 
of or immediately following introduction of new products because 
of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often 
is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient 
supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of 
the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial 
performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the prior 
year's comparable periods through at least the fourth quarter of 1997, if not 
longer.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net 
sales and its cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated by the 
sale of products is influenced principally by the price set by the 
Company for its products relative to competitive products. The cost of goods 
sold is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, 
direct labor costs. The type and cost of components included in particular 
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk 
drives) are often directly related to the need to market products in 
configurations competitive with other manufacturers. Competition in the 
personal computer industry is intense and, in the short term, frequent 
changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary in 
order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short 
term by actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide 
competitive pressures.




				11
<PAGE> 

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales in the second 
quarter and the first six months of 1997, respectively, when compared 
with the corresponding periods of 1996, primarily as a result of a $616 
million charge in the second quarter of 1996 that related principally to the 
write-down of certain inventory, as well as to the cost to cancel excess 
component orders necessitated by significantly lower than expected 
demand for many of the Company's products, primarily its entry level 
products. Also, the Company separately incurred a $60 million charge in the 
second quarter of 1996 to reflect the estimated cost to correct certain quality 
problems in certain entry level, Performa and PowerBook products. In 
addition, gross margins in the second quarter of 1996, and to a lesser degree 
the first quarter of that year, were adversely affected by aggressive 
pricing actions in Japan in response to extreme competitive actions by other 
companies, as well as pricing actions in the U.S. and Europe across all 
product lines in order to stimulate demand.

Gross margin remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales in the second 
quarter, compared with the first quarter of 1997, primarily due to a shift 
in mix toward higher priced and higher margin PowerBook products, 
offset by continued pricing actions, including rebates, across the Performa 
and other product lines in an effort to stimulate demand. 

The gross margin levels in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first 
quarter of 1997 and the second quarter of 1996, and in the first 6 months of 
1997 compared with the corresponding period of 1996, were also adversely 
affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, 
offset by hedging gains. The Company's operating strategy and 
pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the 
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term 
by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain the 
gross margin levels achieved in the second quarter and in the first six 
months of 1997. Gross margins will remain under significant downward 
pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industrywide 
pricing pressures around the world, increased competition, and compressed 
product life cycles. In response to those downward pressures, the 
Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its 
products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to 
effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate 
demand for certain of its products.

Research and development expenditures decreased slightly in 
amount in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 1997 
and the second quarter of 1996, and during the first six months of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to reduced expenditures 
as a result of the Company initiating certain restructuring actions late in 
the second quarter of 1997. The increases as a percentage of net sales 
resulted from decreases in the levels of net sales.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the 
marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new 
and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business 
strategy. The Company believes its research and development 
expenditures will significantly decrease in the third and fourth 
quarters of 1997 compared with the same periods of the prior year and 
compared with the second quarter of 1997, as the Company completes and 
more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan. For 
additional information regarding the restructuring plan, refer to Note 2 of 
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 
I, and to Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition as 
well as Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount in the 
second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 1997 and the second 
quarter of 1996, and during the first six months of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996, primarily due to reduced expenditures as a result of 
actions taken under the Company's restructuring plan. In addition, 
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount in the 
second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter due to the higher 
level of advertising and marketing expenditures incurred during the first 
quarter for the holiday buying season. The increases as a percentage of net 
sales resulted from decreases in the levels of net sales.  

The Company believes its selling, general and administrative 
expenditures will significantly decrease in the third and fourth 
quarters of 1997 compared with the same quarters of the prior year and 
compared with the second quarter of 1997, as the Company completes and 
more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan, 
slightly offset by the amortization expense on the intangible assets the 
Company recognized as a result of the acquisition of NeXT. For additional 
information regarding the Company's restructuring actions and the 
acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased slightly in the second 
quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, primarily as a 
result of higher interest income, partially offset by lower net gains on 
foreign exchange instruments. Interest and other income (expense), 
net, increased in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the first quarter of 
1997, primarily as a result of higher net gains on foreign exchange 
instruments.

Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased in the first six months of 
1997 compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to lower foreign 
currency gains, partially offset by greater interest income.

The Company expects interest income to decrease in the third and fourth 
quarters of 1997 compared with the immediate prior quarters, due to lower 
cash balances as a result of cash used to acquire NeXT, fund the restructuring 
actions over primarily the next two quarters, and fund operations over at 
least the next quarter.

In the second quarter of 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and to B3 and Caa, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. These actions could increase the Company's cost of funds in future 
periods.

At March 28, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from 
deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $651 million 
before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation 
on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is 
realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. In
the first six months of 1997, a valuation allowance of $199 million was 
recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which 
may not be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset is 
dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 million of 
future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more likely than not 
that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. income. However, there 
can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. 
income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered 
realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future 
taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially 
adversely affect the Company's financial results and condition. The 
Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

Overview

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are 
dependent upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, 
and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic 
customer demand patterns, and its ability to effect a change in 
marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the 
viability of the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number 
of factors that the Company must successfully manage in order to 
achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition. 
Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future 
operating results and financial condition include, without limitation, 
continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any 
reaction by the Company to such competitive pressures, including 
pricing actions by the Company; the Company's ability to supply products in 
certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent 
defects or other faults; the Company's ability to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to 
make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current 
Macintosh operating system ("Mac(R) OS") and to make timely delivery of a 
new and substantially backward-compatible OS; the Company's ability to 
successfully integrate NeXT technologies, processes and employees 
with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully implement its 
strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its 
expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees; 
the effects of significant adverse publicity; and the availability of third-
party software for particular applications.

The Company expects that it will not return to profitability until at least the 
fourth quarter of 1997, if not later.

Restructuring of Operations and New Business Model

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring 
actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its 
competitiveness, and restoring sustained profitability. In the second 
quarter of 1997, the Company announced and began to implement 
supplemental restructuring actions, including significant headcount 
reductions, to meet the foregoing objectives. There are several risks 
inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure. 
These include the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce 
expenditures quickly enough to restore sustained profitability and the risk 
that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate 
and remain competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has been implementing a 
new business model. Implementation of the new business model involves 
several risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the 
Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce 
overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and technology. 
Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing the 
proportion of the Company's products to be manufactured under outsourcing 
arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality or quantity of 
the products manufactured, or lose the flexibility to make timely changes in 
production schedules in order to respond to changing market 
conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely affect 
employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and 
motivate employees. Also, because the new business model contemplates that 
the Company will rely to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing 
arrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control 
over certain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to 
create innovative new products may be reduced. In addition, the new business 
model now includes the acquisition of NeXT. There can be no assurance that the 
technologies acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key 
NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated with 
those at Apple. Finally, even if the new business model is successfully 
implemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively 
					17
<PAGE> 

resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In addition, 
although the Company believes that the actions it is taking and will take 
under its restructuring plan and its acquisition of NeXT should help restore 
marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can be no 
assurance that such actions will be successful.

For the foregoing reasons, there can be no assurance that the new business 
model, including the restructuring actions and the acquisition of NeXT, 
will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing its cost 
structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustained profitability. The Company's future operating results and financial 
condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty in 
effectively managing the transition to the new business model and cost 
structure.

For information regarding the Company's restructuring actions and 
the acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to 
Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.


Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is 
characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid 
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products 
and product enhancements, including the recent introductions of certain 
PowerBook and Power Macintosh products. The success of new product 
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market 
acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with 
product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, 
the effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate 
quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may 
have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. 
Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new 
products will have on its sales or results of operations. In addition, 
although the number of new product introductions may decrease under the 
Company's new business model, the risks and uncertainties associated with 
new product introductions may increase as the Company refocuses its 
product offerings on key growth segments.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of 
a new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of 
shipments for that product, which depends on many factors, some of 
which are not under the control of the Company. These factors may include 
initial large purchases by a small segment of the user population that 
tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority 
of users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by 
users who anticipated new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases of 
other products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to 
the aforementioned factors. These factors may be offset by others, such as 
the deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted 
as "proven" and for which commonly used software products are available; 
and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain 
sufficient supply of products previously in backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with 
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can 
obtain sufficient supply of the new products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further 
complicated by the availability of different product configurations, 
which may include various types of built-in peripherals and software. 
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) 
for various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas 
may be a function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of 
				18
<PAGE> 

European-language versions of software products manufactured by 
U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a 
quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's 
new products outside the United States, even though localized versions of the 
Company's products may be available.

The increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations 
of the Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or 
other faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes 
of products have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were 
significant, the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs 
under product warranties.

The Company recently announced a "dual track" approach to its OS 
development. The Company plans to continue to introduce enhancements to 
the current Mac OS and later introduce a new OS (code named "Rhapsody") 
which is expected to offer advanced functionality based upon the Mac OS 
and NeXT software technologies. However, the NeXT software 
technologies that the Company plans to use in the development of Rhapsody 
were not originally designed to be compatible with the Mac OS. As a result, 
there can be no assurance that the development of Rhapsody will be 
successful. In addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible with 
all existing applications, which could result in a loss of existing customers. 
Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody or the planned 
enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain developer support and market 
acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a 
substantially backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements 
to the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market 
acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse impact 
on the Company's operating results and financial condition.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross 
margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, 
continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, 
price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of 
competitors. The Company's results of operations and financial condition 
have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by 
industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. 
The industry has also been characterized by rapid technological 
advances in software functionality and hardware performance and features 
based on existing or emerging industry standards. Many of the Company's 
competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and 
technological resources, broader product lines and larger installed 
customer bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by overall demand for personal computers and general 
customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product 
features over another.

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Mac 
OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer 
market, which is dominated by makers of computers that run the MS-DOS and 
Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, 
with its perceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving 
force behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the 
past several years. Recent innovations in the Windows platform, including 
those included in Windows 95 and Windows NT, have added features to the 
Windows platform which make the differences between the Mac OS and 
Microsoft's operating systems less significant.  The Company is currently 
taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures 
being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent 
innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results 
and financial condition may be affected by its ability to maintain and 
increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.  

As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh 
platform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other 
personal computer vendors in 1995 and 
				19
<PAGE> 

1996. Several vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh 
operating system. The Company believes that licensing the operating 
system will result in a broader installed base on which software vendors can 
develop and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh 
platform. However, there can be no assurance that the installed base will 
be broadened by the licensing of the operating system or that licensing will 
result in an increase in the number of application software titles or the rate 
at which vendors will bring to market application software based on the Mac 
OS. In addition, as a result of licensing its operating system, the Company 
competes with other companies producing Mac OS-based computer 
systems. The benefits to the Company from licensing the Mac OS to third 
parties may be more than offset by the disadvantages of competing with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS and 
Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward 
developing personal computer products capable of running 
application software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems 
("Cross-Platform Products"). These products include the RISC-based 
PowerPC(TM) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 586-class 
microprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing a Pentium or 
586-class microprocessor. These products enable users to run 
concurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, or 
Windows 95 operating systems. 

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who 
purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system software 
under licensing agreements with Microsoft. However, in order to do so, 
the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements with certain 
Microsoft distributors.

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and 
Motorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of 
specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware 
reference platform. These specifications define a "unified" 
personal computer architecture that gives access to both the Power 
Macintosh platform and the PC environment and utilizes standard 
industry components. The Company's future operating results and financial 
condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this 
agreement and to manage the risk associated with the transition to this 
new hardware reference platform. Microsoft recently announced that it 
would no longer adapt its Windows NT operating system software, which is 
being used more by corporations, to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. 
This decision may adversely affect revenues derived from this new 
hardware reference platform.

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as 
opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the 
availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company 
believes that the availability of third-party application software for the 
Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' 
perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, 
and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software 
for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market. This analysis is based on 
factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the 
anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of 
developing such software products. To the extent the Company's recent 
financial losses and declining demand for the Company's product have caused 
software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal 
computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new 
application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's 
products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and 
upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market. Microsoft 
Corporation is an important developer of application software for the 
Company's products. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing 
application software for the Company's products may be influenced by 
Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows 
operating systems. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also 
dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of 
the PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to 
supply to the Company in adequate numbers 
				20

microprocessors that produce superior price/performance results compared 
with those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, the 
developer and producer of the microprocessors used by most personal 
computers using the MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.  In 
addition, the desire of IBM and Motorola to continue producing these 
microprocessors may be influenced by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its 
Windows NT operating system software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. 
IBM produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as well 
as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the 
developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Mac 
OS. Accordingly,IBM's interest in supplying the Company with 
microprocessors for the Company's products may be influenced by IBM's 
perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal 
computers and as a competing operating system vendor.

Several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and Microsoft, 
have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the 
Company's key market segments, including education and publishing. 
Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, 
and technological resources than the Company.

The Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and existing 
hardware and software platforms. There can be no assurance that the 
Company will be able to continue to do so successfully. In addition, the 
Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing 
number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products 
addressing access to, authoring for, or communication over, the Internet. 
Many of these competitors have a significant lead over the Company in 
developing products for the Internet, have significantly greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the 
Company, or both.

Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's operations and 
financial results could be significantly affected by international factors, 
such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic 
conditions in the foreign markets in which the Company distributes its 
products. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, 
the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. 
dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. 
Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases 
when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar 
strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than 
the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely 
affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. 
Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's 
consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates 
on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and 
operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-
based exposures. Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts to hedge its assets, liabilities and firmly 
committed transactions. Currently, hedges of firmly committed 
transactions do not extend beyond one year. The Company also purchases 
foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain other probable but not 
firmly committed transactions. Hedges of probable but not firmly committed 
transactions currently do not extend beyond one year. To reduce the costs 
associated with these ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the 
Company also regularly sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters 
into certain other foreign exchange transactions. All foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all 
transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the Company's 
foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are 
adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  
				21
<PAGE> 

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest 
rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's 
interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general 
level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates 
affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments as well as interest paid on its notes payable to 
banks and long-term debt. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. 
interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, collar, 
and floor transactions. Certain of these transactions are intended to better 
match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments with the fixed-rate 
interest expense on its long-term debt. The Company also enters into these 
transactions in order to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure 
away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. These instruments 
may extend the Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum 
duration of three years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign 
exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the 
risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company 
continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and 
its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis
and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-
related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic 
perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk 
management activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned 
programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact 
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest 
rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and 
losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not 
coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying 
economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's 
operating results and financial position. The Company generally does not 
engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition is expected to increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of the 
hedging transactions into which the Company's counterparties are willing 
to enter.

Inventory and Supply

The Company provides reserves against any inventories of products that have 
become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand, accrues for any 
cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled, 
and accrues for the estimated costs to correct any product quality problems.  
Although the Company believes its inventory and related reserves are 
adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur 
additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges 
have had, and may again have, a material affect on the Company's 
financial position and results of operations.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory 
well in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are 
volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk 
that the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or 
insufficient inventories of particular products. The Company's operating 
results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future 
be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its 
inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by 
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the 
Company or otherwise. As a result of the Company's restructuring actions, 
which include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, both in the second quarter of 
1996, the proportion of the Company's products produced and distributed 
under outsourcing arrangements will increase. While outsourcing 
				22
<PAGE> 

arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the 
direct control the Company has over production. It is uncertain what effect 
such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products 
manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing 
market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its 
inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement. 
Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain 
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains 
at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty 
service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, 
the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated product 
defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with 
contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's 
future operating results and financial condition.

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited 
by the availability of key components. The Company believes that the 
availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of 
microprocessors and ASICS presents the most significant potential for 
constraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production 
and thus have limited availability. The Company and other producers in the 
personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor 
products with other industries that have experienced increased demand 
for such products, due to either increased consumer demand or 
increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular 
phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some 
components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry 
(including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of 
these components may be affected if producers were to decide to 
concentrate on the production of common components instead of 
components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product 
supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the 
Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's operating results 
and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the 
Company's products. Currently, the Company's primary means of 
distribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers 
include consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer 
electronics outlets, and computer superstores. The Company's business 
and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial 
condition of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer 
channels were to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's 
products.

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause 
resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. 
Under the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the 
option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most 
instances without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to return 
products to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond 
which they may be assessed fees. The Company has experienced a reduction 
in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty 
concerning the Company's condition and prospects.

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, 
its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including 
certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's 
operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely 
affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may 
subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, 
in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers 
with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its 
useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or 
recycling with the 
				23
<PAGE> 

Company. It is unclear what effect such regulation will have on the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company is currently reevaluating replacement of all its existing 
transaction systems (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated 
system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition could be 
adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and effectively 
manage the transition to this new integrated system, or, alternatively, if 
the Company is unable to effectively manage its existing transaction 
systems.  

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company entered into a 
"Master Logistics Management Services" agreement with Ryder 
Integrated Logistics, Inc. to outsource the Company's domestic operations 
transportation and logistics management. While this outsourcing 
agreement, and other similar agreements entered into to outsource 
the Company's European operations transportation and logistics 
management, may lower the Company's fixed costs of operations, it will also 
reduce the direct control the Company has over its transportation and 
logistics management. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control 
will have on the Company's transportation and logistics 
management.

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its Napa, 
California, data center to MCI Systemhouse ("MCI") and entered into a 
data processing outsourcing agreement with MCI in the fourth quarter of 1996. 
While this outsourcing agreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of 
operations, it will also reduce the direct control the Company has over its 
data processing. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will 
have on the Company's data processing.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial 
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation 
in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the 
Company's common stock price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, decreased to $1,326 
million at March 28, 1997, from $1,559 million at September 27, 1996. The 
Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments decreased to $1,459 million at March 28, 1997, from 
$1,745 million at September 27, 1996. The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balance at March 28, 1997 and September 27, 1996, includes $167 
million and $177 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support 
letters of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase 
commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first six months of 1997 totaled $194 
million, primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and 
inventories, partially offset by the Company's net loss adjusted for non-
cash expenses such as in-process research and development. The 
Company expects to use cash to fund operations over at least the next 
quarter.

The Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity 
investments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less 
for the remainder of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996. 



				24
<PAGE> 

Cash used to acquire NeXT totaled $383 million in the second quarter of 1997. 
The Company expects no additional cash expenditures related to the NeXT 
acquisition. Cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment 
totaled $36 million in the first six months of 1997, and consisted 
primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and 
equipment. The Company expects that the level of capital expenditures for 
the remainder of 1997 will be comparable to the same period of 1996.

In the second quarter of 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated 
long-term debt were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and 
Poor's Rating Agency and to B3 and Caa, respectively, by Moody's Investor 
Services. The Company was also placed on negative credit watch by Moody's 
Investor Services.  These actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in 
future periods.  In addition, the Company may be required to pledge 
additional collateral with respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of 
credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than in the past.

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and 
short-term investments, together with continued short-term borrowings from 
banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next 12 
months. In addition to funding an expected net loss for at least the next  
quarter, expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include 
an estimated $170 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, 
most of which will be effected over the next two quarters. Also, the notes 
payable to banks all become due prior to July 1, 1997. No assurance can be 
given that short-term borrowings from banks can be continued, or that 
any additional required financing could be obtained should the 
restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be 
unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, 
results of operations, and financial condition would be materially 
adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made 
certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute 
for these years have been resolved. On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice 
of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of the Company's federal 
income taxes for the years 1989 through 1991. The Company has filed a 
petition with the United States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax 
deficiencies. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for 
any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 45 of the Company's 1996 Annual Report on 
Form 10-K under the subheading "Litigation" and to page 23 of the 
Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended 
December 27, 1996 under the heading "Legal Proceedings" for a discussion of 
certain purported shareholder class action suits, certain consumer class 
actions relating to monitor-size advertising, and "repetitive stress 
injury" claims.

In February  1997, the Court in the case styled Abraham and Evelyn Kostick 
Trust v. Peter Crisp  et. al.  sustained the Company's demurrer with respect 
to purported class action claims and overruled it with respect to purported 
derivative claims. In April 1997, the Company filed a motion to strike most 
of the substantive allegations of the second amended complaint.

In February 1997, the Court in the case styled Derek Pritchard v. Michael 
Spindler et. al.  sustained the Company's demurrer and dismissed the 
plaintiff's first amended complaint, with prejudice.

In March 1997, the plaintiff in the case styled LS Men's Clothing Defined 
Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael Spindler et. al.  filed an amended 
complaint expanding the class period from April 4, 1995 to January 15, 1997 
and adding several current and former officers of the Company as defendants. 
The Company intends to file a demurrer seeking dismissal of the 
amended complaint.

In March 1997, the court in the case styled In re Computer Monitor 
Litigation  preliminarily approved a proposed settlement to which the 
Company and all but three of the other defendants in the action are parties 
and provisionally certified a settlement class with respect thereto. A hearing 
regarding final approval of the proposed settlement is scheduled for 
June 30, 1997. If approved, the Company does not anticipate its 
obligations pursuant to the proposed settlement will have a material adverse 
effect on its financial condition as reported in the accompanying 
financial statements.

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of false or 
misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement 
of intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and other matters 
against the Company  and its subsidiaries incident to the operation 
of its business. The liability, if any, associated with these matters was not 
determinable as of the date of this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above will not have a 
material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements. However, depending on the amount 
and timing of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is 
possible that the Company's future results of operations or cash flows 
could be materially affected in a particular period.

EXHIBIT 3.3
				  BY-LAWS

				     OF

			     APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

			  (a California corporation)

		     (as amended through April 4, 1997)


				 Article I

				  OFFICES

	Section 1.1:	Principal Office.  The principal executive office for the 
transaction of the business of this corporation shall be 1 Infinite Loop, 
Cupertino, California 95014.  The Board of Directors is hereby granted full 
power and authority to change the location of the principal executive 
office from one location to another.

	Section 1.2: 	Other Offices.  One or more branch or other subordinate 
offices may at any time be fixed and located by the Board of Directors at 
such place or places within or without the State of California as it deems 
appropriate.


Article II

DIRECTORS

	Section 2.1:	Exercise of Corporate Powers.  Except as otherwise 
provided by these By-Laws, by the Articles of Incorporation of this 
corporation or by the laws of the State of California now or hereafter in 
force, the business and affairs of this corporation shall be managed and all 
corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of 
Directors.

	Section 2.2: 	Number.  The number of directors of the corporation 
shall be not less than five (5) nor more than nine (9).  The exact number of 
directors shall be seven (7) until changed within the limits specified 
above, by a by-law amending this section, duly adopted by the Board of 
Directors or by the shareholders.  The indefinite number of directors may be 
changed, or a definite number fixed without provision for an indefinite 
number, by a duly adopted amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or by 
an amendment to this by-law duly adopted by the vote or written consent 
of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; 
provided, however, that an amendment reducing the fixed number or the 
minimum number of directors to a number less than five (5) cannot be 
adopted if the votes cast against its adoption at a meeting of the 
shareholders, or the shares not consenting in the case of action by 
written consent, are equal to more than 16-2/3% of the outstanding shares 
entitled to vote.  No amendment may change the stated maximum number of 
authorized directors to a number greater than two times the stated 
minimum number of directors minus one.

	Section 2.3:	Need Not Be Shareholders.  The directors of this 
corporation need not be shareholders of this corporation.

	Section 2.4:	Compensation.  Directors and members of committees 
may receive such compensation, if any, for their services as may be fixed 
or determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Nothing herein 
contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving 
this corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
				30
<PAGE>

	Section 2.5:	Election and Term of Office.  The directors shall be
divided into two classes, designated Class I and Class II.  Each class shall 
consist of one-half of the directors or as close an approximation as possible.  
The initial term of office of the directors of Class I shall expire at the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991 and the initial term of 
office of the directors of Class II shall expire at the annual meeting to be 
held during fiscal year 1992.  At each annual meeting, commencing with the 
annual meeting to be held during fiscal year 1991, each of the successors to 
the directors of the class whose term shall have expired at such annual meeting
shall be elected for a term running until the second annual meeting next 
succeeding his or her election and until his or her successor shall have been 
duly elected and qualified.

	Section 2.6:	Vacancies.  A vacancy or vacancies on the Board of 
Directors shall exist in case of the death, resignation or removal of any 
director, or if the authorized number of directors is increased, or if the 
shareholders fail, at any annual meeting of shareholders at which any 
director is elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors to be 
voted for at that meeting. The Board of Directors may declare vacant the office 
of a director if he or she is declared of unsound mind by an order of court or 
convicted of a felony or if, within 60 days after notice of his or her 
election, he or she does not accept the office. Any vacancy, except for a 
vacancy created by removal of a director as provided in Section 2.7 hereof, may 
be filled by a person selected by a majority of the remaining directors 
then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining 
director. Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors by reason of 
removal of directors shall be filled only by approval of shareholders. The 
shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled 
by the directors. Any such election by written consent requires the consent 
of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. If, after the filling
of any vacancy by the directors, the directors then in office who have been 
elected by the shareholders shall constitute less than a majority of the 
directors then in office, any holder or holders of an aggregate of 5% or more 
of the total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to 
vote for such directors may call a special meeting of shareholders to be 
held to elect the entire Board of Directors. The term of office of any 
director shall terminate upon such election of a successor. Any director 
may resign effective upon giving written notice to the Chairman of the 
Board, if any, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Secretary or 
the Board of Directors of this corporation, unless the notice specifies 
a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is 
effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the 
resignation becomes effective. A reduction of the authorized number of 
directors shall not remove any director prior to the expiration of such 
director's term of office.

	Section 2.7:	Removal. The entire Board of Directors or any 
individual director may be removed without cause from office by an 
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote; 
provided that, unless the entire Board of Directors is removed, no director 
shall be removed when the votes cast against removal, or not consenting in 
writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect such director if voted 
cumulatively (without regard to whether such shares may be voted

by the President or by the Board of Directors, or by two or more members 
thereof, or by one or more holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten 
percent (10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to 
Section 10.8.  Upon request in writing sent by registered mail to the Chief 
Executive Officer, President, Vice President or Secretary, or delivered to 
any such officer in person, by any person or persons entitled to call a 
special meeting of shareholders (such request, if sent by a shareholder or 
shareholders, to include the information required by Section 10.13), 
it shall be the duty of such officer, subject to the immediately succeeding

a meeting will be requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, 
the date of which meeting, which shall be set by such officer, to be not less 
than 35 days nor more than 60 days after such request or, if applicable, 
determination of the validity of such request pursuant to the immediately

shall be given in writing not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the

or refusal, by any director or shareholder.  The notice shall state the 
place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, 
the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may 
be transacted, or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which 
the Board of Directors, at the time of the mailing of the notice, intends to 
present for action by the shareholders, but any proper matter may be 
presented at the meeting for such action except 
				38
<PAGE>

that notice must be given or waived in writing of any proposal relating to 
approval of contracts between the corporation and any director of this 
corporation, amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of 
this corporation or winding up of this corporation. The notice of any meeting 
at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of nominees 
intended at the time of the notice to be presented by management for election. 
Written notice shall be given by this corporation to any shareholder, either 
(i) personally or (ii) by mail or other means of written communication, 
charges prepaid, addressed to such shareholder at such shareholder's 
address appearing on the books of this corporation or given by such 
shareholder to this corporation for the purpose of notice. If a shareholder 
gives no address or no such address appears on the books of this 
corporation, notice shall be deemed to have been given if sent by mail or 
other means of written communication addressed to the place where the 
principal executive office of this corporation is located, or if published 
at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which 
such office is located. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at the 
time when delivered personally or deposited in the United States mail, 
postage prepaid, or sent by other means of written communication and 
addressed as hereinbefore provided. An affidavit of delivery or mailing of 
any notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.4, executed 
by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent, shall be prima 
facie evidence of the giving of the notice. If any notice addressed to the 
shareholder at the address of such shareholder appearing on the books of 
the corporation is returned to this corporation by the United States Postal 
Service marked to indicate that the United States Postal Service is unable to 
deliver the notice to the shareholder at such address, all future notices shall 
be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same 
shall be available for the shareholder upon written demand of the 
shareholder at the principal executive office of this corporation for a period 
of one year from the date of the giving of the notice to all other 
shareholders.

	Section 10.5:	Consent to Shareholders' Meetings. The 
transactions of any meeting of shareholders, however called and 
noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly 
held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or 
by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the shareholders 
entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of 
notice or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the 
minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents or approvals shall be filed 
with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. 
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of 
such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the 
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not 
lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a 
waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by 
law to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is 
expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the 
purpose of any regular or special meeting of shareholders need be 
specified in any written waiver of notice, except as to approval of 
contracts between this corporation and any of its directors, amendment of the 
Articles of Incorporation, reorganization of this corporation or 
winding up the affairs of this corporation.

	Section 10.6:	Quorum. The presence in person or by proxy of the 
holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares 
shall not be counted to make up a quorum for a meeting if voting of such 
shares at the meeting has been enjoined or for any reason they cannot 
be lawfully voted at the meeting. The shareholders present at a duly called or 
held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact 
business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of 
enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other 
than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the shares required 
to constitute a quorum.

	Section 10.7:	Adjourned Meetings. Any shareholders' meeting, 
whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by 
the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either present 
in person or represented by proxy thereat, but, except as provided in 
Section 10.6 hereof, in the absence of a quorum, no other business may be 
transacted at such meeting.  When a meeting is adjourned for more than 45 
days or if after adjournment a new 
					39
<PAGE>

record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned 
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote 
at a meeting. Except as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any 
notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to 
be transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which 
such adjournment is taken. At any adjourned meeting the shareholders 
may transact any business which might have been transacted at the 
original meeting.

Section 10.8:	Voting Rights. Only persons in whose names shares 
entitled to vote stand on the stock records of this corporation at the close 
of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is 
given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day 
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held or, if some other day be 
fixed for the determination of shareholders of record pursuant to 
Section 2.8(k) hereof, then on such other day, shall be entitled to vote at 
such meeting. In the absence of any contrary provision in the Articles of 
Incorporation or in any applicable statute relating to the election of 
directors or to other particular matters, each such person shall be entitled to 
one vote for each share.

In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to 
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3, the Board of Directors 
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon 
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of 
Directors, and which date shall not be more than fourteen (14) days after the 
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board 
of Directors. Any shareholder of record seeking to have the shareholders 
authorize or take corporate action by written consent or request a special 
meeting of the shareholders pursuant to Section 10.3 shall, by written notice 
to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The 
Board of Directors shall promptly, but in no event later than twenty eight (28)
days after the date on which such request is received, adopt a resolution 
fixing the record date.

	Section 10.9:	Action by Written Consents.  Any action which may be 
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken without a 
meeting and without prior notice, if a consent in writing, setting forth the 
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares having 
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to 
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to 
vote thereon were present and voted.  Within fourteen (14) days after 
receiving such written consent or consents from shareholders of the 
corporation, the Board of Directors shall determine whether holders of 
outstanding shares as of the record date established pursuant to Section 
10.8 having not less than the minimum number of votes which would be 
necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares 
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted have properly consented 
thereto in writing and notify the requesting party of its finding. Unless 
the consents of all shareholders entitled to vote have been solicited in 
writing, notice of any shareholder approval of (i) contracts between this 
corporation and any of its directors, (ii) indemnification of any person, 
(iii) reorganization of this corporation or (iv) distributions to shareholders 
upon winding up of this corporation in certain circumstances without a 
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given at least 
10 days before the consummation of the action authorized by such 
approval, and prompt notice shall be given of the taking of any other 
corporate action approved by shareholders without a meeting by less 
than unanimous written consent, to those shareholders entitled to vote who 
have not consented in writing.  All notices given hereunder shall conform 
to the requirements of Section 10.4 hereto and applicable law.  When 
written consents are given with respect to any shares, they shall be 
given by and accepted from the persons in whose names such shares 
stand on the books of this corporation at the time such respective consents 
are given, or any shareholder's proxy holder, or a transferee of the shares or 
a personal representative of the shareholder or their respective proxy 
holders, may revoke the consent by a writing received by this corporation 
prior to the time that written consents of the number of shares required to 
authorize the proposed action have been filed with the Secretary of this 
corporation, but may not do so thereafter.  Such revocation is 
effective upon its receipt by the Secretary of this corporation.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, directors may not be elected 
by written consent except by unanimous written consent of all 
shares entitled to vote for the election of directors.
				40
<PAGE>
	Section 10.10: Elections of Directors. In any election of directors, 
the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the 
shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be 
elected by such shares are elected; votes against the directors and votes 
withheld with respect to the election of the directors shall have no legal
effect.  Elections of directors need not be by ballot except upon demand made 
by a shareholder at the meeting and before the voting begins.

	Section 10.11: Proxies.  Every person entitled to vote or execute 
consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more 
agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or such 
person's duly authorized agent and filed with the Secretary of this 
corporation.  No proxy shall be valid (l) after revocation thereof, unless the 
proxy is specifically made irrevocable and otherwise conforms to this Section 
10.11 and applicable law, or (2) after the expiration of eleven months from 
the date thereof, unless the person executing it specifies therein the 
length of time for which such proxy is to continue in force.  Revocation may 
be effected by a writing delivered to the Secretary of this corporation 
stating that the proxy is revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by 
attendance at the meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the 
proxy.  A proxy is not revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker 
unless, before the vote is counted, a written notice of such death or 
incapacity is received by this corporation.  A proxy which states that 
it is irrevocable is irrevocable for the period specified therein when it is 
held by any of the following or a nominee of any of the following: (l) a 
pledgee, (2) a person who has purchased or agreed to purchase or holds an 
option to purchase the shares or a person who has sold a portion of such 
person's shares in this corporation to the maker of the proxy, (3) a creditor 
or creditors of this corporation or the shareholder who extended or continued 
credit to this corporation or the shareholder in consideration of the proxy if 
the proxy states that it was given in consideration of such extension or 
continuation of credit and the name of the person extending or continuing 
the credit, (4) a person who has contracted to perform services as an 
employee of this corporation, if a proxy is required by the contract of 
employment and if the proxy states that it was given in consideration of 
such contract of employment, the name of the employee and the period of 
employment contracted for, (5) a person designated by or under a close 
corporation shareholder agreement or a voting trust agreement.  In addition, 
a proxy may be made irrevocable if it is given to secure the performance of a 
duty or to protect a title, either legal or equitable, until the happening of 
events which, by its terms, discharge the obligation secured by it. 
Notwithstanding the period of irrevocability specified, the proxy 
becomes revocable when the pledge is redeemed, the option or agreement to 
purchase is terminated or the seller no longer owns any shares of this 
corporation or dies, the debt of this corporation or the shareholder is paid, 
the period of employment provided for in the contract of employment has 
terminated or the close corporation shareholder agreement or the voting 
trust agreement has terminated. In addition, a proxy may be revoked, 
notwithstanding a provision making it irrevocable, by a purchaser of shares 
without knowledge of the existence of the provision unless the existence of 
the proxy and its irrevocability appears on the certificate 
representing such shares. Every form of proxy or written consent, which 
provides an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval with respect to 
any proposal, shall also contain an appropriate space marked "abstain", 
whereby a shareholder may indicate a desire to abstain from voting his or her 
shares on the proposal. A proxy marked "abstain" by the shareholder 
with respect to a particular proposal shall not be voted either for or against 
such proposal.  In any election of directors, any form of proxy in which 
the directors to be voted upon are named therein as candidates and which 
is marked by a shareholder "withhold" or otherwise marked in a manner 
indicating that the authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld 
shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.

	Section 10.12: Inspectors of Election. Before any meeting of 
shareholders, the Board of Directors may appoint any persons other than 
nominees for office to act as inspectors of election at the meeting or its 
adjournment. If no inspectors of election are so appointed, the 
Chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or a 
shareholder's proxy shall, appoint inspectors of election at the meeting. 
The number of inspectors shall be either one (l) or three (3).  If 
inspectors are appointed at a meeting on the request of one or more 
shareholders or proxies, the 
				41
<PAGE>

holders of a majority of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall 
determine whether one (l) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any 
person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the 
Chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any shareholder or 
a shareholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.

	These inspectors shall:

		(a) 	Determine the number of shares outstanding and the 
voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the 
existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of 
proxies;

		(b)	Receive votes, ballots, or consents;

		(c)	Hear and determine all challenges and questions in any 
way arising in connection with the right to vote;

		(d)	Count and tabulate all votes or consents;

		(e)	Determine when the polls shall close;

		(f)	Determine the result; and

		(g)	Do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the 
election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.
	
	Section 10.13:  Advance Notice of Shareholder Proposals and Director 
Nominations.  Shareholders may nominate one or more persons for election as 
directors at a meeting of shareholders or propose business to be brought before
a meeting of shareholders, or both, only if such shareholder has given timely 
notice in proper written form of such shareholder's intent to make such
nominationor nominations or to propose such business.  To be timely, a 
shareholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Corporation not 
later than 60 days prior to such meeting; provided, however, that in 
the event less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of 
the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the 
shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of 
business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of 
the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.  To be in proper 
written form a shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) the 
name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nominations 
or propose the business and, as the case may be, of the person or persons to be 
nominated or of the business to be proposed, (ii) a representation that the 
shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation that intends to 
vote such stock at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person 
or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the 
notice, (iii) if applicable, a description of all arrangements or 
understandings between the shareholder and each nominee or any other person or 
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the 
nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such 
other information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to 
be proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a 
proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A promulgated by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be 
nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, 
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation and (v) if applicable, the 
consent of each nominee as director of the Corporation if so elected.  The 
chairman of a meeting of shareholders may refuse to acknowledge the 
nomination of any person or the proposal of any business not made in 
compliance with the foregoing procedure.

the "Regular Annual Meeting") and at such other times as may be designated 
from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Notice of the time 
and place of all regular meetings shall be given in the same manner as for 
special meetings, except that no such notice need be given if (l) the time and

	Section 11.4:	Notice of Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the 
Board of Directors shall be held upon no less than four days' notice by mail 
or 48 hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone or telegraph to each 
director. Notice need not be given to any director who signs a waiver of notice
or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at its

has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. A notice 
or waiver of notice need not specify the purpose of any meeting of the Board. 
If the address of a director is not shown on the records and is not readily 
ascertainable, notice shall be addressed to him at the city or place in which 
the meetings of the directors are regularly held. If the meeting is adjourned

directors and indemnification of agents of this corporation. A majority 
of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn

of the required quorum for such meeting.

Directors may participate in a meeting through use of conference telephone 
or similar communications equipment, so long as all directors participating in 
such meeting can hear one another.  Participation in a meeting pursuant to 
this Section 11.6 constitutes presence in person at such meeting.

before or after the meeting, each of the directors not present signs a

meeting.

permitted by law to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken 
without a meeting, if all members of the Board of Directors shall 
individually or collectively consent in writing to such action.  Such written

by the Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial Officer or the 
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares and 
the class or series of shares owned by the shareholder.  Any or all of the 
signatures on the certificate may be facsimile.  In case any officer, transfer 
agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been 
placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer 
agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by 
this corporation with the same effect as if such person were an officer, 
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

	Section 12.4:	Lost Certificates.  Where the owner of any certificate
for shares of this corporation claims that the certificate has been lost, 
stolen or destroyed, a new certificate shall be issued in place of the original 
certificate if the owner (l) so requests before this corporation has notice

on Friday of such week, and the fiscal months in any one calendar quarter shall 
be comprised of at least four consecutive calendar weeks with one week to be 
added, at management's discretion, to any one month during such fiscal year.

	Section 12.8:	Officer Loans and Guaranties.  If the corporation has 
outstanding shares held of record by 100 or more persons on the date of 
approval by the Board of Directors, the corporation may make loans of money 
or property to, or guarantee the obligations of, any officer of the 
corporation or its parent or subsidiaries, whether or not the officer 
is a director, upon the approval of the Board of Directors alone. Such approval 
by the Board of Directors must be determined by a vote of a majority of 
the disinterested directors, if it is determined that such a loan or 
guaranty may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. In no event 
may an officer owning 2% or more of the outstanding common shares of the 
corporation be extended a loan under this provision.

said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.

	Section 13.2:	By-Law Provisions Contrary to or Inconsistent with 
Provisions of Law.  Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, 
clause or phrase of these By-Laws which, upon being construed in the 
manner provided in Section 13.1 hereof, shall be contrary to or 
inconsistent with any applicable provision of law, shall not apply so

not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these 
By-Laws, it being hereby declared that these By-Laws, and each article,

abridging, limiting or restricting the aforesaid rights of any shareholders, 
then, and in either of such events, all certificates of shares of stock subject
to such abridgments, limitations or restrictions shall have a reference 
thereto endorsed thereon by an officer of this corporation and such 
certificates shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of this 
corporation except in accordance with the terms and provisions of such 
agreement or ByLaw, as the case may be; provided, that no restriction shall 
be binding with respect to shares issued prior to adoption of the 
restriction unless the holders of such shares voted in favor of or consented 
in writing to the restriction.

				Article XVI

			EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS

of this Article XVI, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes 
any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) 
who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or 
officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other 
enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a 
predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at 
the request of such predecessor corporation.

	Section 16.2:	Indemnification of Others.  The corporation shall have the

settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in 
connection with any proceeding (as defined in Section 317(a) of the Code), 
arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the 
corporation.  For purposes of this Article XVI, an "employee" or "agent" 
of the corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any

or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of 
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other

provided by this Article XVI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other 
rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under

made under this Article XVI, except where such indemnification or 
advance is mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court

shareholders or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the 
alleged cause of the action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses 
were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise

expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

This annual performance-based incentive plan (the "Performance 
Share Plan" or the "Plan") is designed to reward executive officers of Apple 
Computer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") for achieving 
performance objectives. The Performance Share Plan is intended to 
provide an incentive for superior performance and to motivate 
participating officers toward even higher achievement and business 
results, to tie their goals and interests to those of the Corporation and its 
shareholders, to promote the maintenance of substantial stock 
ownership levels by officers of the Corporation, and to enable the 
Corporation to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers. 
The Performance Share Plan is also intended to secure the full deductibility 
of incentive compensation payable to the Corporation's Chief Executive 
Officer and the four highest compensated executive officers 
(collectively the "Covered Employees") whose compensation is required to be 
reported in the Corporation's proxy statement and all compensation 
payable hereunder to such persons is intended to qualify as "performance-
based compensation" as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

2.	ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

Only (i) those executive officers of the Corporation at the level of senior 
vice president or above and (ii) such other key employees of the Company as 
are recommended by management to and designated by the Compensation 
Committee shall be eligible to participate in the Performance Share 
Plan.  Prior to or at the time performance objectives are established 
for a "Performance Period", as defined below, the Compensation Committee 
(the "Committee") of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") will 
designate in writing those executive officers and other key employees 
among those who may be eligible to participate in the Plan who shall in 
fact be participants for such Performance Period (the 
"Participants").  The initial Participants in the Performance Share 
Plan shall be the individuals holding the positions identified in Appendix A.

3.	PLAN YEAR AND PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES

(A) PLAN YEAR: The fiscal year of the Performance Share Plan (the "Plan 
Year") shall be the fiscal year beginning on the first day of the 
Company's fiscal year and ending on the last day of the Company's fiscal 
year. The performance period (the "Performance Period") with respect to 
which awards may be payable under the Plan shall be the Plan Year, or, in 
the event the Committee designates an employee to participate in the Plan as 
of a date that is after the beginning of the Plan Year, such shorter period as 
the Committee designates. The initial Plan Year shall commence on 
September 30, 1996 and end on September 26, 1997.

(B) PERFORMANCE GOAL SETTING PERIOD: Within the first ninety (90) 
days of each Performance Period the Committee shall establish in writing, 
with respect to such Performance Period, one or more performance goals, 
a specific target objective or objectives with respect to such performance 
goals and an objective formula or method for computing the amount of 
performance shares payable to each Participant under the Plan if the 
performance goals are attained. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, for any 
				49
<PAGE>

Performance Period, such goals, objectives and compensation formulae 
or methods must be established within that number of days, beginning on the 
first day of such Performance Period, which is no more than twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the total number of days in such Performance Period.  The 
Committee may, but shall not be required to, set performance goals for 
any Participant whose Performance Period is shorter than the Plan Year 
that are different from the performance goals for Participants 
whose Performance Period is the Plan Year, and may, but shall not be 
required to, set such separate performance goals within twenty-five 
percent (25%) of the total number of days remaining in the Plan Year at the 
time such Participants are designated as Participants in the Plan.  Any such 
separate performance goals shall be selected from among the performance 
goals listed in Section 3(C) hereof.

(C) PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT: Performance goals shall be based upon 
one or more of the following business criteria for the Company:

	 -  earnings per share

	 -  share price

	 -  revenue growth

	 -  return on equity

	 -  return on net assets

	 -  timing objectives for delivery of new products

	 -  retention of key employees

The Committee may adopt other performance goals in its sole and 
absolute discretion, provided, however, that in the event the Committee 
determines to adopt performance goals based on criteria other than those 
stated above, the Committee shall obtain shareholder approval of such 
criteria.  All performance goals adopted by the Committee shall be 
preestablished, objective performance goals as described in Reg. Sec. 1.162-
27(e)(2), promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Code. Measurements of 
the Company's or a Participant's performance against the performance 
goals established by the Committee shall be objectively determinable and, 
to the extent any performance goal is expressed in standard accounting 
terms, such performance goal shall be determined according to generally 
accepted accounting principles as in existence on the date on which the 
performance goals are established and without regard to any changes in such 
principles after such date.

4.	DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

(A) SHARES COVERED BY THE PLAN: Shares awarded under the 
Performance Share Plan shall be shares of the Company's common stock 
("Shares"). The maximum number of Shares that may be awarded under the 
Plan shall be 2,000,000 in the aggregate and, in any single Plan Year, 300,000 
to any one individual, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6(k). 
Shares that are converted to cash in accordance with Section 5 shall be 
treated as shares awarded under the Plan for purposes of the aggregate and 
individual limits in the previous sentence. Any increase in the number 
of Shares allocated 
				    50
<PAGE>

to the Plan must be approved by the Company's shareholders. Any Shares 
deliverable under the Plan may be made available from authorized but 
unissued Shares or Shares reacquired by the Company, including Shares 
purchased in the open market or in private transactions.

(B) GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES: At the beginning of each Performance 
Period, each Participant will be granted the target number of Shares 
(see Appendix A) that can be earned based on performance with respect to 
that Performance Period (the "Conditional Grant"). At the time the 
Conditional Grant is made on behalf of a Participant, certificates representing 
the target number of Shares will be registered in the name of the 
Participant. During the Performance Period, the certificates representing 
those Shares will be held by the Company. The Committee may specify 
that the Conditional Grant for a Performance Period will be earned if 
the applicable target is achieved for one goal or for any one of a number of 
goals. The Committee may also provide that the Conditional Grant for a 
Performance Period will be earned only if targets are achieved for more 
than one performance goal. The Committee may also provide that the 
Conditional Grant to be earned for a given Performance Period will vary 
based upon different levels of achievement of the applicable 
performance targets.

As soon as practicable after the end of each Performance Period, the 
Committee shall certify in writing to what extent the Company and the 
Participants have achieved the performance goal or goals for such 
Performance Period, including the specific target objective or objectives 
and the satisfaction of any other material terms of the  Plan and the 
Committee shall calculate the amount of each Participant's actual award for 
such Performance Period based upon the performance goals, objectives and 
computation formulae or methods for such Performance Period (the "Actual 
Grant"). The Committee shall have no discretion to increase the maximum 
amount of any Participant's Actual Grant as so determined, but may reduce 
the amount of or totally eliminate such award, as it determines, in its 
absolute and sole discretion, in an amount appropriate to reflect the 
Participant's performance.

No Participant's Actual Grant for any Plan Year shall exceed the number of 
Shares stated in Appendix A.

Only after the Actual Grant has been awarded to a Participant will he or she 
have the rights of a shareholder in the Company with respect to any of the 
Shares covered by the Conditional Grant, including the right to vote the 
Shares and the right to receive any distributions with respect to such 
Shares.

5.	PAYMENT OF AWARDS

Approved performance share awards shall be payable by the Company to 
each Participant in Shares, or, at the election of the Participant, fifty 
percent (50%) in Shares and fifty percent (50%) in cash ("Cash 
Election"), as soon as reasonably practicable after the last day of the 
relevant Performance Period (the "vesting date"), provided that the 
Committee has first certified in writing that the relevant performance goals 
were achieved. In the event that a Participant makes a Cash Election, the 
amount of cash to be awarded shall be determined by the Committee as of each 
vesting date, such that (subject to the performance goals for that 
Performance Period being fully satisfied), the Participant receives fifty 
percent of the total value of the Shares earned as of the vesting date in cash 
and the remainder in Shares, based on the closing price of the Company's 
common stock on the vesting date.  Cash Elections for any Performance 
Period shall be made on a form 
				51
<PAGE>

provided for the purpose by the Committee within sixty (60) days of the 
date an employee is notified by the Committee that he or she has been 
designated as a Participant in the Plan for that Performance Period.  Except in 
the case of an Actual Grant made to a Participant's Beneficiary (as 
hereinafter defined), a participant is precluded from selling or otherwise 
disposing of any interest in Actual Grant Shares until such time as the 
Shares are distributed to the Participant.

If a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company prior to the end of any 
Plan Year, award payment rights will be determined as follows:

A.	Involuntary termination by the Company for cause or voluntary 
termination by a Participant would lead to a Participant's forfeiture of all 
Performance Share Plan awards for that Plan Year. Termination for cause 
is defined as follows: conviction of (i) a felony, (ii) embezzlement from the 
Company or (iii) other business fraud.

B.	Termination on account of death, disability, or involuntary 
termination not for cause by the Company entitles a Participant, or the 
Participant's Beneficiary, to a prorated share of the performance share award.  
Prorated awards are determined based on the number of completed months 
that the Participant was employed in the Performance Period divided by 12 
months (or by such lesser number of months as constitutes the Performance 
Period in the case of a Performance Period that is shorter than the Plan 
Year) and are subject to reduction as provided in Section 4(b). Prorated 
awards shall be paid at the same time as if the Participant had remained 
employed until the end of the Plan Year.

6.	OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(A) TERM OF PLAN: The Performance Share Plan shall become effective 
upon its adoption by the Board, subject to the subsequent approval thereof by 
the shareholders of the Company in accordance with Section 6(b).  It shall 
continue in effect for a term of five (5) years unless sooner terminated under 
Section 7 of the Plan.

(B) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL: No Actual Grants shall be awarded under 
the Performance Share Plan unless and until the material terms (within 
the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code) of the Plan, including the 
business criteria described in the Plan, are disclosed to the Company's 
shareholders and are approved by the shareholders by a majority of votes 
cast in person or by proxy (including abstentions to the extent abstentions 
are counted as voting under applicable state law).

(C) NO PARTICIPATION RIGHTS: No person shall have any legal claim to be 
granted an award under the Performance Share Plan and the 
Committee shall have no obligation to treat Participants uniformly. 
Participation in the Performance Share Plan in any Plan Year does not 
entitle any Participant to participate in the Plan in any other Plan Year. The 
right to receive a targeted number of performance shares in any given year 
does not entitle a Participant to participate with respect to the same 
number of Shares in any subsequent year.

(D) NO RIGHTS TO SPECIFIC PROPERTY: Except as may be otherwise required by 
law, Conditional Grants and Actual Grants under the Performance Share 
Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, 
sale, transfer, assignment, 
				      52
<PAGE>

pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any 
kind, either voluntary or involuntary. No Participant shall have any claim 
with respect to any specific assets of the Company or to stock certificates 
registered in the Participant's name prior to the vesting of the shares 
represented by such certificates.

(E) NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS: Neither the Performance Share Plan nor any 
action taken under the Plan shall confer upon any Participant any right 
with respect to continuation of employment by the Company (or any 
subsidiary or affiliated company) or to maintain any Participant's 
compensation at any level, nor shall it interfere in any way with any 
Participant's right or the right of the Company (or any subsidiary or 
affiliated company) to terminate a Participant's employment at any time 
or for any reason.

(F) OTHER BENEFITS: Performance share awards shall not be considered as 
part of a Participant's salary or used for the calculation of any other pay, 
allowance, pension or other benefit unless otherwise permitted by other 
benefit plans provided by the Company or its subsidiaries, or required by law 
or by contractual obligations of the Company or its subsidiaries.

(G) BENEFICIARY: The term "Beneficiary" shall mean the person or 
persons designated by a Participant to whom performance share are to be 
paid pursuant to the terms of the Performance Share Plan in the event 
of the Participant's death. The designation shall be on a form 
provided by the Committee, executed by the Participant, and delivered to the 
Committee. A Participant may change his or her Beneficiary designation at 
any time. If no Beneficiary is designated, the designation is 
ineffective, or in the event the Beneficiary dies before the balance of the 
performance share award is paid, the balance shall be paid to the Participant's
spouse, or if there is no spouse, in equal shares to the Participant's lineal 
descendants, or if there is no surviving spouse or lineal descendant, to the 
Participant's estate.

(H) PERMANENT DISABILITY: For purposes of the Performance Share 
Plan, a permanent disability shall mean a disability which would qualify 
a Participant to receive benefits under the Apple Computer, Inc. Long-Term 
Disability Plan (after satisfying the elimination period thereunder) as now 
or hereafter in effect.

(I) INCAPACITY OF PARTICIPANT OR BENEFICIARY: If the Committee finds 
that any Participant or Beneficiary to whom a performance share award is 
payable under the Performance Share Plan is unable to care for his or her 
affairs because of illness or accident or is under a legal disability, any 
performance share award due (unless a prior claim therefore shall have been 
made by a duly appointed legal representative) at the discretion of the 
Committee, may be paid to the spouse, child, parent or brother or sister of 
such Participant or Beneficiary or to any person whom the Committee has 
determined has incurred expense for such Participant or Beneficiary. Any 
such payment shall be a complete discharge of the obligations of the 
Company under provisions of the Performance Share Plan to the extent 
of such payment.

(J) TAX WITHHOLDING: The Company will withhold from each Actual Grant 
at the time of payment thereof all applicable state, local and federal 
withholding taxes, as required by law, as determined by Apple in its sole 
discretion. Such withholding will be made first from the amount of the 
Participant's Cash Election, if any, and second from the Participant's Shares, 
to the extent required. Alternatively, in lieu of withholding from Shares, the 
Participant may elect to fund the payment of withholding taxes 
determined by Apple to be due by making payment of the full amount of 
the withholding taxes to Apple on or before the due date of the withholding 
taxes.
				     53
<PAGE>

(K) ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

If the outstanding Shares are increased, decreased, or exchanged for 
a different number of kind of shares or other securities, or if additional 
Shares or other securities are distributed with respect to such Shares or 
other securities, through merger, consolidation, sale of all or 
substantially all of the property of the Company, reorganization, 
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse 
stock split or other distribution with respect to such Shares or other 
securities, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment may be made in 
(i) the maximum number and kind of Shares provided for in Section 4(a) of 
the Plan, (ii) the annual individual maximum grant limit provided for in 
Section 4(a), (iii) the number and kind of Shares subject to each then 
outstanding performance share award, and (iv) each Participant's target 
number of Shares as provided in Appendix A.

Adjustments under this Section 6(k) will be made by the Committee, whose 
determination as to what adjustments will be made and the extent thereof 
will be final, binding and conclusive on all interested persons. No fractional 
Share or other interest will be issued under the Plan on account of any of 
such adjustments

(L) CHANGE IN CONTROL: In the event of a change in control (as defined 
below) of the Company, the Committee shall make equitable adjustments to the 
Participant's Performance Shares in a manner intended to preserve their 
economic value as of the date of the change in control, including 
modifications to performance measures and performance goals if necessary; 
provided, however, that if a Participant's employment with the 
Company is terminated without cause in connection with a change in 
control, then any other provision of the Plan to the contrary 
notwithstanding, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the maximum 
annual number of Performance Shares for the year in which the change-in-
control occurs following such termination regardless of whether the 
Performance Goals are achieved. For purposes of this Plan, change in 
control is defined as follows:

A.	When any "person", as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) 
of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, a Subsidiary or a Company 
employee benefit plan, including any trustee of such plan acting as a trustee) 
is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 
Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company 
representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of 
the Company's then outstanding securities; or

B.	The occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and 
involving either the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company or the merger of the Company with or into another entity.

(M) CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES: Shares shall not be issued with 
respect to an Actual Grant unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares 
pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, 
without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, 
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of 
any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Shares may 
then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of 
counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
				     54
<PAGE>

Inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body 
having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be 
necessary to the lawful issuance of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the 
Company of any liability in respect of the non-issuance of such Shares as to 
which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.

(N) GOVERNING LAW: The place of administration of the Performance 
Share Plan shall be in the State of California and the validity, 
construction, interpretation, administration and effect of the 
Performance Share Plan and the rules, regulations and rights relating to the 
Performance Share Plan, shall be determined solely in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California.

7.	ADMINISTRATION

(A) ADMINISTRATOR: The Plan shall be administered by a Committee 
designated by the Board to administer the Plan, which Committee shall be 
constituted in such a manner as to permit the Plan and grants and awards 
thereunder to comply with Rule 16b-3 as it applies to grants to officers and
in such a manner as to satisfy the Applicable Laws.  All members of the 
Committee shall be persons who qualify as "outside directors" as defined 
under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Until changed by the Board, the Compensation
Committee of the Board shall constitute the Committee hereunder.

(B) POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR: The Committee shall have full power, 
authority and discretion to administer and interpret the provisions of the 
Performance Share Plan and to adopt such rules, regulations, agreements, 
guidelines and instruments for the administration of the Plan and for the 
conduct of its business as the Committee deems necessary or 
advisable. Without limitation of the foregoing, subject to the provisions of 
the Plan and such limitations as are necessary or desirable in order for 
incentive awards paid to Covered Employees to constitute qualified 
performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the 
Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to determine the 
amount of cash to be awarded pursuant to any Cash Election under Section 5 
above; (ii) to determine the employees who shall be Participants in the Plan; 
(iii) to interpret the Plan; (iv) to determine the terms and conditions, 
not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Conditional Grant or 
Actual Grant awarded hereunder (including, but not limited to, any 
restriction or limitation, or any waiver of forfeiture restrictions regarding 
any Grant and/or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such 
factors as the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion); (v) to 
approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan; (vi) to prescribe, 
amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (vii) 
to modify or amend each Grant (with the consent of the Participant); (viii) 
to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument 
required to effectuate any Grant previously granted by the 
Administrator; and (ix) to make all other determinations deemed 
necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

(C) EFFECT OF DECISIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATOR: All decisions, 
determinations and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and 
binding on all Participants.

8.	AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan, as 
it may deem advisable; provided that except as otherwise required by law, 
any amendment required to conform the Performance Share Plan to the 
requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code or to conform the Performance 
Share Plan or any grant made thereunder to the requirements for 
exemption under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor thereto ("Rule 16b-3"), 
shall be made by the Committee, and provided that, to the extent necessary 
and desirable to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code (or any other 
applicable law, regulations or rules), the Company shall obtain shareholder 
approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as 
is required, including, without limitation, any amendment to the class 
of individuals who are eligible to participate in the Performance Share 
Plan, to the performance criteria specified in Section 2 hereof or to the 
maximum incentive award payable to any Participant, unless shareholder 
approval is not required in order for incentive awards paid to Covered 
Employees to constitute qualified performance-based compensation 
under Section 162(m) of the Code. Any such amendment, alteration, 
suspension or termination of the Plan shall not impair the rights of any 
Plan Participant under any grant theretofore made without his or her 
consent.  Such grants shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan 
had not been amended or terminated, except as may otherwise be required by 
applicable law.

EXHIBIT 10.A.44
				Apple Computer, Inc.
			Non-Employee Director Stock Plan


			   (Effective March 25, 1997)

		1.	Purposes.  The purposes of the Plan are (i) to retain 
the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company 
to serve as members of the Board and to secure for the Company the benefits of 
the incentives inherent in increased Common Stock ownership by such 
individuals by granting such individuals Options to purchase shares 
of Common Stock and (ii) to provide such individuals an opportunity to 
defer payment of a portion of their Director's Fees in accordance with the 
terms and conditions set forth herein. 

		2.	Administration.  
The Administrator will be responsible for administering the Plan.  The 
Administrator will have authority to adopt such rules as it may deem 
appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Plan, and shall have authority to 
interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan and any agreements and 
notices under the Plan and to make determinations pursuant to any Plan 
provision.  Each interpretation, determination or other action made or 
taken by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on 
all persons.  The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or 
determination made in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and 
reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company's Articles of 
Incorporation and By-Laws as such documents may be amended from time 
to time.

		3.	Shares Available.

		Subject to the provisions of Section 8(b) of the Plan, the 
maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the 
Plan shall not exceed 700,000  shares (the "Section 3 Limit"). Either 
authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock or treasury shares may 
be delivered pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of determining the number 
of shares that remain available for issuance under the Plan, the following 
rules shall apply:

		a)	the number of outstanding Phantom Stock Units and 
shares of Common Stock underlying Options shall be charged against the 
Section 3 Limit; and

		(b)	the Section 3 Limit shall be increased by (A) the 
number of shares subject to an Option which lapses, expires or is otherwise 
terminated without the issuance of such shares, and (B) the number of 
shares tendered to pay the exercise price of an Option.
		
		4.	Options.  Each Non-Employee Director shall receive 
grants of Options under the Plan as follows:

		(a)	Option Grants.

	(i)	Initial Grant.  On the date of a Non-Employee Director's 
initial election or appointment to the Board (or, in the case of Non-Employee 
Directors who were members of the Board on the Effective Date, on the 
Effective Date), such Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee 
Director reelected or reappointed after a period of at least 12 calendar months 
during which he did not serve on the Board) shall be granted an Option to 
purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock.  Such Option shall have a per 
share exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock 
determined as of the date of grant and shall be subject to the vesting schedule 
provided for in Section 4(b) and the other terms and conditions provided 
for herein. The provisions of this Section 4(a)(i) shall not apply to any 
member of the Board who first becomes a Non-Employee Director by reason of 
such member's ceasing to be an employee of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries.
				      58
<PAGE>

	(ii)	Annual Grants.  At each Annual Meeting occurring after the 
Effective Date and during the term of the Plan, each individual who has 
continuously served as a Non-Employee Director for a period ending on the 
date of such Annual Meeting and who is reelected at such Annual Meeting or 
who will otherwise continue to serve on the Board following such Annual 
Meeting will receive an Option to purchase that number of shares of 
Common Stock equal to the sum of "A" plus "B", where "A" equals 7,500, and 
"B" equals the product obtained by multiplying 3,500 by the number of 
committees of the Board for which the Non-Employee Director is either 
elected or appointed as of the date of the Annual Meeting to serve as 
chairperson for the upcoming year.  The Option shall have a per share 
exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock determined 
as of the date of grant and shall be subject to the vesting schedule 
provided for in Section 4(b) and the other terms and conditions provided 
for herein.

		(b)	Vesting Schedule of Options.  Options awarded pursuant
to the Plan shall vest and become exercisable in equal annual 
installments on each of the first through third anniversaries (each, a 
"Vesting Date") of the date of grant of the Option; provided, however, that if 
(i) a Non-Employee Director is not renominated for election to the Board 
at an Annual Meeting at which such director's term is scheduled to expire, 
(ii) the NonEmployee Director serves as a Non-Employee Director through the 
date of such Annual Meeting and (iii) the next scheduled Vesting Date of any 
Option granted to such NonEmployee Director falls within the three-month 
period following the date of such Annual Meeting, then such Vesting 
Date shall be deemed for purposes of the Plan and each such Option to have 
occurred on the day immediately prior to the date of such Annual Meeting. 
Any fractional share which results from the application of the foregoing 
vesting schedule shall vest in the final vesting installment.  In addition, if 
a Non-Employee Director's service with the Board terminates as a result of such 
Non-Employee Director's death, then, as of the date of death, all Options 
previously granted to such Non-Employee Director shall become fully 
and immediately vested and exercisable.

		(c)	Term of Options. 

	(i)	Ten-Year Term.  Each Option shall expire ten years from its 
date of grant, subject to earlier termination as provided herein.

	(ii)  	Exercise Following Termination of Service Due to Death.  If 
a NonEmployee Director ceases to be a member of the Board by reason of such 
NonEmployee Director's death, the Options granted to such Non-Employee 
Director may be exercised by such Non-Employee Director's Beneficiary at 
any time within three years after the date of such termination of service, 
subject to the earlier expiration of such Options as provided for in Section 
4(c)(i) above.  At the end of such three-year period, the vested portion 
of the Option shall expire.

	(iii)	Termination of Options if a Non-Employee Director is Removed 
from the Board for Cause.  In the event a Non-Employee Director is removed 
from the Board for "cause," all Options granted to such Non-Employee Director 
(whether or not then vested and exercisable) shall immediately 
terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the effective date of 
such removal from the Board. Whether a Non-Employee Director is removed by 
the Board for "cause" shall be determined by the Board in accordance 
with the By-Laws of the Company.

	(iv)  	Exercise Following Other Terminations of Service.  If a Non-
Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board for any reason 
other than death or removal from the Board for cause, then (A) the Non-
Employee Director shall have the right, subject to the terms and conditions 
hereof, to exercise the Option, at any time within ninety days after the date 
of such termination, subject to the earlier expiration of the Option as 
provided for in Section 4(c)(i) above, but only to the extent that such Option 
				      59
<PAGE>

was exercisable by the Non-Employee Director on the date of such 
termination. The unvested portion of the Option shall expire on the date of 
the Non-Employee Director's termination of service with the Board.  At the
end of such ninety-day period, the vested portion of the Option shall expire.

		(d)	Time and Manner of Exercise of Options.

	(i)	Notice of Exercise.  Subject to the other terms and 
conditions hereof, a Non-Employee Director may exercise any Options, to 
the extent such Options arevested, by giving written notice of exercise to the 
Company; provided, however, that in no event shall an Option be exercisable 
for a fractional share. The date of exercise of an Option shall be the later 
of (A) the date on which the Company receives such written notice and (B) 
the date on which the conditions provided in Section 4(d)(ii) are 
satisfied.
		
	(ii)  	Payment.  Subject to the last three sentences of this Section 
4(d)(ii), prior to the issuance of a certificate pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) 
hereof evidencing the shares of Common Stock in respect of which all 
or a portion of an Option shall have been exercised, a Non-Employee 
Director shall have paid to the Company the exercise price of the 
Option for all such shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of such Option.  
Payment may be made by personal check, bank draft or postal or express 
money order (such modes of payment are collectively referred to as "cash") 
payable to the order of the Company in U.S. dollars, or in shares of Common 
Stock already owned by the Non-Employee Director for at least six 
months at the time of exercise valued at their Fair Market Value as of the last 
business day preceding the date of exercise, or in a combination of cash or 
such shares. Payment of the exercise price in shares of Common Stock shall 
be made by delivering to the Company the share certificate(s) representing 
the required number of shares, with the NonEmployee Director signing his 
or her name on the back, or by attaching executed stock powers (the 
signature of the Non-Employee Director must be guaranteed in either 
case).  In addition to the exercise methods described above, a Non-
Employee Director may exercise an Option through a "cashless exercise" 
procedure whereby the Non-Employee Director delivers to the Company an 
irrevocable notice of exercise in exchange for the Company issuing the 
shares of Common Stock subject to the Option to a broker previously 
designated or approved by the Company.  Such broker will 
immediately sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock on behalf of 
the Non-Employee Director to pay the exercise price of the Option and shall 
remit the amount of the exercise price to the Company in cash from the sales 
proceeds and deliver the balance, if any, of the sales proceeds (net of 
commissions) to such NonEmployee Director.  Any shares not sold by the 
broker shall be delivered to the NonEmployee Director in the manner 
contemplated by Section 4(d)(v) below.

	(iii)  	Stockholder Rights.  A Non-Employee Director shall have no 
rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Common Stock issuable 
upon exercise of an Option until a certificate evidencing such shares 
shall have been issued to the NonEmployee Director pursuant to 
Section 4(d)(v), and no adjustment shall be made for dividends or 
distributions or other rights in respect of any share for which the record date 
is prior to the date upon which the Non-Employee Director shall become 
the holder of record thereof.	

	(iv)  	Limitation on Exercise.  No Option shall be exercisable unless 
the Common Stock subject thereto has been registered under the Securities 
Act and qualified under applicable state "blue sky" laws in connection 
with the offer and sale thereof, or the Company has determined that an 
exemption from registration under the Securities Act and from qualification 
under such state "blue sky" laws is available.



				     60
<PAGE>

	(v)  	Issuance of Shares.  Subject to the foregoing conditions, as 
soon as is reasonably practicable after its receipt of a proper notice of 
exercise and payment of the exercise price of the Option for the number of 
shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, the Company shall 
deliver to the Non-Employee Director (or following the Non-Employee 
Director's death, the Beneficiary entitled to exercise the Option), at the 
principal office of the Company or at such other location as may be 
acceptable to the Company and the Non-Employee Director (or such 
Beneficiary), one or more stock certificates for the appropriate number 
of shares of Common Stock issued in connection with such exercise.  
Shares sold in connection with a "cashless exercise" shall be delivered to 
the broker designated or appointed by the Company in the time and manner 
described in Section 4(d)(ii) above.  Any such shares shall be fully paid and
nonassessable.

		(e)	Restrictions on Transfer.  An Option may not be 
transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of, except by will or 
by the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that the 
Administrator may, subject to such terms and conditions as the 
Administrator shall specify, permit the transfer of an Option to a Non-
Employee Director's family members or to one or more trusts established in 
whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.  The 
Option shall be exercisable, during the NonEmployee Director's lifetime, only 
by the Non-Employee Director or by the individual or entity to whom the 
Option has been transferred in accordance with the previous 
sentence.  No assignment or transfer of the Option, or of the rights 
represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or 
otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, shall vest 
in the assignee or transferee any interest or right in the Option, but 
immediately upon any attempt to assign or transfer the Option the same shall 
terminate and be of no force or effect.

		5.	Deferral of 
Director's Fees.

		(a)	Deferral Elections.

	(i)	General Provisions.  Non-Employee Directors may elect to defer 
all or a specified percentage of their Director's Fees with respect to a 
Deferral Period in the manner provided in this Section 5.  A Non-
Employee Director's Deferred Benefit is at all times nonforfeitable.
	
	(ii)  	Deferral Election Forms.  Before the Election Date applicable 
to a Deferral Period, each Non-Employee Director will be provided with a 
Deferral Election Form and a Beneficiary Designation Form.  In 
order for a Non-Employee Director to participate in the deferral portion of 
the Plan for a given Deferral Period, a Deferral Election Form, completed and 
signed by him, must be delivered to the Company on or prior to the applicable 
Election Date.  A Non-Employee Director electing to participate in the 
Plan for a given Deferral Period shall indicate on his Deferral Election Form:

	     	(A)	the percentage of the Director's Fees for the Deferral 
Period to be deferred;

		(B)	if the Deferral Election Form is the first such form 
filed by the Non-Employee Director, the Non-Employee Director's election, 
in accordance with Sections 5(f) and 5(g), as to the timing and manner of 
payment of the Deferred Benefits.  A Non-Employee Director's election as to 
the timing and manner of payment of Deferred Benefits in the initial 
Deferral Election Form shall govern the timing and manner of payment of 
all subsequent deferrals under the Plan and may not be changed or 
revoked without the prior written consent of the Administrator; and 

		(C)	whether amounts deferred for the Deferral Period will 
be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account as Phantom Stock Units in 
accordance with Section 5(b) below or Phantom Cash Amounts in accordance 
with Section 5(c) below.  A Non-Employee Director's election as to the 
method of crediting deferred 
				      61
<PAGE>

amounts for a given Deferral Period may not be subsequently changed or 
revoked.  Director's Fees for a given Deferral Period may be deferred in 
part in Phantom Cash Amounts and in part in Phantom Stock Units.  Any such 
allocation shall be in multiples of 10% (not to exceed 100%) of the amounts 
deferred. 

	(iii)  	Effect of No Deferral Election.  A Non-Employee Director 
who does not submit a completed and signed Deferral Election Form to the 
Company on or prior to the applicable Election Date may not defer his 
Director's Fees for the Deferral Period.

		(b)	Establishment of Deferred Compensation Accounts.  A 
Non-Employee Director's deferrals will be credited to a Deferred Compensation 
Account set up for that Non-Employee Director by the Company in accordance 
with the provisions of this Section 5.

		(c)	Crediting of Phantom Cash Amounts to Deferred 
Compensation Accounts.  The portion of the Director's Fees that a Non-Employee 
Director elects to deferin the form of Phantom Cash Amounts shall be 
credited to the Deferred Compensation Account as of the last business day of 
the fiscal quarter in which such portion of the Director's Fees would 
otherwise have been payable to the Non-Employee Director.  The Phantom 
Cash Amount credited to the Deferred Compensation Account shall thereafter 
be credited with notional interest as of the last day of each month.  The 
annual rate of interest in effect for a Deferral Period shall be the 
"applicable federal rate" for short-term loans with monthly compounding, as 
promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service under Section 1274 of the Internal
Revenue Code for the first month in such Deferral Period. 

		(d)	Crediting of Phantom Stock Units to Deferred 
Compensation Accounts. 

	(i)	Number of Phantom Stock Units.  The portion of the Director's 
Fees that a Non-Employee Director elects to defer in the form of Phantom 
Stock Units shall be credited to the Deferred Compensation Account as of 
the last business day of the fiscal quarter in which such portion of the 
Director's Fees would otherwise have been payable to the Non-Employee 
Director.  The number of Phantom Stock Units to be credited to the 
Deferred Compensation Account shall be determined by dividing (1) the 
amount of the Director's Fees deferred over such quarter by (2) the Fair 
Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of crediting.  Any 
partial Phantom Stock Unit that results from the application of the previous 
sentence shall be rounded up to a whole Phantom Stock Unit.

	(ii)	Dividend Equivalents.  In the event that the Company pays any 
cash or other dividend or makes any other distribution in respect of the 
Common Stock, each Phantom Stock Unit credited to the Deferred 
Compensation Account of a NonEmployee Director will be credited 
with an additional number of Phantom Stock Units (including fractions 
thereof) determined by dividing (A) the amount of cash, or the value (as 
determined by the Administrator) of any securities or other property, paid 
or distributed in respect of one outstanding share of Common Stock by 
(B) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock as of the date of such 
payment or distribution.  Any partial Phantom Stock Unit that results from 
the application of the previous sentence shall be rounded up to a 
whole Phantom Stock Unit.  Such credit shall be made effective as of the date
of the dividend or other distribution in respect of the Common Stock.

	(iii)	No Rights as Stockholder.  The crediting of Phantom Stock Units 
to a Non-Employee Director's Deferred Compensation Account shall not confer on 
the Non-Employee Director any rights as a stockholder of the Company. 

		(e)	Written Statements of Account. The Company will furnish 
each NonEmployee Director with a statement setting forth the value of 
such Non-Employee Director's Deferred Compensation Account as of the end of 
each Deferral Period and all credits to and 
				      62
<PAGE>

payments from the Deferred Compensation Account during the Deferral Period.  
Such statement will be furnished no later than 60 days after the end of the 
Deferral Period.

		(f)  	Manner of Payment of Deferred Benefit.  Payment 
of the portion of the Deferred Benefits under the Plan credited as Phantom 
Cash Amounts shall be in cash and payment of the portion of the Deferred 
Benefits credited in Phantom Stock Units shall be in shares of Common 
Stock.  Payment shall be made either in a single lump sum or in a series of 
five or fewer annual installments.  The amount of each installment payment to 
a NonEmployee Director shall be determined in accordance with the 
formula B/(N - P), where "B" is the total value of the Deferred 
Compensation Account as of the installment calculation date, "N" is the 
number of installments elected by the Non-Employee Director and "P" is the 
number of installments previously paid to the Non-Employee Director.  If a 
Non-Employee Director's Deferred Benefit is credited in part in Phantom 
Cash Amounts and in part in Phantom Stock Units and the Non-Employee 
Director elects the payment of Deferred Benefits in more than one installment, 
then the formula in the previous sentence shall be applied separately 
with respect to each such portion of the Deferred Compensation Account.

		(g)  	Commencement of Payment of Deferred Benefit.  Payment 
of a NonEmployee Director's Deferred Benefit shall commence as soon as 
practicable (but in no event more than 60 days) after the earlier to occur of:

	(i) 	termination of service as a member of the Board; and

    	(ii)  	the date specified in the Deferral Election Form executed by the 
	NonEmployee Director.

		(h)  	Death.  In the event of a Non-Employee Director's death, 
the NonEmployee Director's entire Deferred Benefit (including any unpaid
 portion thereof corresponding to installments not yet paid at the time 
of death), to the extent not distributed earlier pursuant to Section 5(g), 
will be distributed in a lump sum to the Non-Employee Director's Beneficiary as 
soon as practicable after the date of death, but in no event more than six 
months after the Non-Employee Director's date of death.

		(i)	Restrictions on Transfer.  The Company shall pay all 
Deferred Benefits payable under the Plan only to the Non-Employee 
Director or Beneficiary designated under the Plan to receive such 
amounts.  Neither a Non-Employee Director nor his Beneficiary shall have 
any right to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or 
change any benefits to which he may become entitled under the Plan, and 
any attempt to do so shall be void.  A Deferred Benefit shall not be subject to 
attachment, execution by levy, garnishment, or other legal or 
equitable process for a Non-Employee Director's or Beneficiary's debts or 
other obligations.
		
		6.	Designation of Beneficiary.

		(a)  	Beneficiary Designations.  Each Non-Employee 
Director may designate a Beneficiary to receive any Deferred Benefit due 
under the Plan or to exercise an Option upon the Non-Employee Director's 
death by executing a Beneficiary Designation Form.  

		(b)  	Change of Beneficiary Designation.  A Non-
Employee Director may change an earlier Beneficiary designation by 
executing a later Beneficiary Designation Form and delivering it to 
the Administrator.  The execution of a Beneficiary Designation Form and its 
receipt by the Administrator revokes and rescinds any prior Beneficiary 
Designation Form.





				     63
<PAGE>

		7.	Change in Control.

		Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the 
event of a Change in Control of the Company, the following provisions 
shall apply:

		(a)	Any Options outstanding as of the date such Change 
in Control is determined to have occurred that are not yet exercisable 
and vested on such date shall become fully exercisable and vested.

		(b)	The value of all outstanding Options (to the extent 
not previously exercised) shall be cashed out on the date of the Change in 
Control.  The amount at which such Options shall be cashed out shall be 
equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Change in Control Price over (ii) the 
exercise price of the Common Stock covered by the Option.  The cash-out 
proceeds shall be paid to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event of 
death of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary 
thereof.

		(c)	All Deferred Benefits credited to the Non-Employee 
Director's Deferred Compensation Account as of the date of the Change in 
Control shall be paid in cash to the Non-Employee Director or, in the event 
of death of the Non-Employee Director prior to payment, to the Beneficiary 
thereof on the date of the Change in Control.  The cash amount paid for each 
whole or partial Phantom Stock Unit shall be the Change in Control Price.

		(d)	If the Administrator shall receive an opinion 
from a nationally recognized firm of accountants to the Company that the 
cash-out provisions in Section 7(b) above with respect to Options or the 
payment of Phantom Stock Units in cash by the Company in accordance 
with Section 7(c) above will prohibit the utilization of "pooling of interests" 
accounting in connection with the transaction resulting in the Change in 
Control of the Company, then the following shall apply, but only to the 
extent necessary to permit such accounting treatment:  (i) (A) the 
provisions of Section 7(b) shall not apply to the Options,(B) each such 
Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable as of the date such 
opinion is received by the Administrator, and (C) the 
Administrator shall promptly inform each Non-Employee Director of such 
opinion and of the accelerated vesting and exercisability of the Option 
sufficiently prior to the anticipated date of the Change in Control so as to 
permit the Options to be exercised prior to the date of the Change in Control, 
and (ii) the Phantom Stock Units shall be settled in shares of Common Stock 
on the date that such opinion is received by the Administrator.  

		8.	Recapitalization or Reorganization.

		(a)	Authority of the Company and Shareholders.  The 
existence of the Plan shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or 
power of the Company or the shareholders of the Company to make or authorize 
any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the 
Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation 
of the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to 
purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks 
whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof 
or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the 
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all 
or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or 
proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

		(b)	Change in Capitalization.  Notwithstanding any 
other provision of the Plan, in the event of any change in the 
outstanding Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend, recapitalization, 
reorganization, merger, consolidation, stock split, combination or exchange of 
shares (a "Change in Capitalization"), (i) such proportionate adjustments as 
may be necessary (in the form determined by the Administrator in its 
sole discretion) to reflect such change shall be made to prevent dilution or 
enlargement of the rights of Non-Employee Directors under the Plan with respect 
to the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock authorized to be awarded 
under the Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by each 
outstanding Option and the exercise prices in respect thereof, the  
				     64
<PAGE>


number of shares of Common Stock covered by future Option grants and 
the number of Phantom Stock Units credited to a Non-Employee Director's 
Deferred Compensation Account and (ii) the Administrator may make such 
other adjustments, consistent with the foregoing, as it deems appropriate in 
its sole discretion.

		(c)	Dissolution or Liquidation.  In the event of the 
proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, each outstanding Option 
will vest and become exercisable on a date prior to the consummation of the 
proposed action that is reasonably sufficient to enable the Non-Employee 
Directors to exercise their Options.  All Deferred Benefits credited to the 
Non-Employee Director's Deferred Compensation Account as of the date of 
the consummation of a proposed dissolution or liquidation shall be paid 
in cash to the NonEmployee Director or, in the event of death of the Non-
Employee Director prior to payment,to the Beneficiary thereof on the date of 
the consummation of such proposed action.  The cash amount paid for each 
whole or partial Phantom Stock Unit shall be the Fair Market Value of a 
share of Common Stock as of the date of the consummation of such proposed 
action.

		9.	Termination and Amendment of the Plan.  

		(a)	Termination.  The Plan shall terminate on the tenth 
anniversary of the Effective Date.  Following the Effective Date, no 
further grants of Options shall be made pursuant to the Plan and no further 
Director's Fees may be deferred by a Non-Employee Director. 

		(b)	General Power of Board.  Notwithstanding anything 
herein to the contrary, the Board may at any time and from time to time 
terminate, modify, suspend or amend the Plan in whole or in part; provided, 
however, that no such termination, modification, suspension or 
amendment shall be effective without shareholder approval if such approval 
is required to comply with any applicable law or stock exchange rule; 
and provided further, that the Board may not, without shareholder 
approval, increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the 
Plan except as provided in Section 8(b) above. 

		(c)	When Non-Employee Directors' Consents Required.  
The Board may not alter, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan without 
the consent of any Non-Employee Director to the extent that such action 
would (i) adversely affect his or her rights with respect to Options that have 
previously been granted or (ii) result in the distribution to such 
NonEmployee Director of amounts then credited to his Deferred Compensation 
Account in any manner other than as provided in the Plan or could 
reasonably be expected to result in the immediate taxation to such Non-
Employee Director of Deferred Benefits.

		10.	Miscellaneous.

		(a)	No Right to Reelection.  Nothing in the Plan shall 
be deemed to create any obligation on the part of the Board to nominate any 
of its members for reelection by the Company's stockholders, nor confer 
upon any Non-Employee Director the right to remain a member of the Board 
for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.

		(b)	Unfunded Plan.  

	(i)	Generally.  This Plan is unfunded.  Amounts payable under the 
Plan will be satisfied solely out of the general assets of the Company subject 
to the claims of the Company's creditors.
	
	(ii)	Deferred Benefits.  A Deferred Benefit represents at all times 
an unfunded and unsecured contractual obligation of the Company and each 
Non-Employee Director or Beneficiary will be an unsecured creditor of 
the Company.  No Non-Employee Director, Beneficiary or any other person shall 
have any interest in any fund or in any specific asset of the Company by reason 
of any amount credited to him hereunder, nor shall any Non-Employee Director, 
Beneficiary or any other person have any right to 
				      65
<PAGE>

receive any distribution under the Plan except as, and to the extent, 
expressly provided in the Plan. The Company will not segregate any funds 
or assets for Deferred Benefits or issue any notes or security for the payment 
of any Deferred Benefits.  Any reserve or other asset that the Company may 
establish or acquire to assure itself of the funds to provide benefits under 
the Plan shall not serve in any way as security to any Non-Employee Director, 
Beneficiary or other person for the performance of the Company under 
the Plan.

		(c)	Other Compensation Arrangements.  Benefits 
received by a NonEmployee Director pursuant to the provisions of the Plan 
shall not be included in, nor have any effect on, the determination of benefits 
under any other arrangement provided by the Company.

		(d)	Securities Law Restrictions.  The Administrator may 
require each NonEmployee Director purchasing or acquiring shares of 
Common Stock pursuant to the Plan to agree with the Company in writing 
that such Non-Employee Director is acquiring the shares for investment 
and not with a view to the distribution thereof.  All certificates for shares 
of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-
transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem 
advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission or any exchange upon which the Common 
Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and 
the Administrator may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such 
certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.  No 
shares of Common Stock shall be issued hereunder unless the Company shall 
have determined that such issuance is in compliance with, or pursuant to an 
exemption from, all applicable federal and state securities laws.

		(e)	Expenses.  The costs and expenses of administering the 
Plan shall be borne by the Company.

		(f)	Applicable Law.  Except as to matters of federal law, 
the Plan and all actions taken thereunder shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to 
conflicts of law principles.

		(g)	Effective Date.  The Plan shall be effective as of the 
Effective Date, subject to the approval thereof by the stockholders of the 
Company by no later than the next Annual Meeting to occur after the 
Effective Date.  If such stockholder approval is notobtained by the date of 
such Annual Meeting, (i) all prior Option grants shall be void ab initio 
and of no further force and effect, and (ii) all Director's Fees previously 
deferred under the Plan (together with notional interest credited at the rate 
described in the last sentence of Section 5(c) above) shall be paid to the 
Non-Employee Director in cash within ten days following the date of the 
Annual Meeting.
