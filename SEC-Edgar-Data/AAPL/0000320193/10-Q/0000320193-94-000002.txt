             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results  have been included.  The results for  interim  periods
   are  not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire
   year.    These  financial  statements  and  notes  should  be  read   in
   conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial  statements
   and  the  notes  thereto for the fiscal year ended September  24,  1993,
   included  in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
   24, 1993 (the "1993 Form 10-K").

2. Effective September 25, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting  Standards No. 109 -Accounting for Income Taxes  (FAS  109),
   which  changes  the  method  of accounting for  income  taxes  from  the
   deferred  method  to  the liability method.  This change  in  accounting
   principle  has  been adopted on a prospective basis, and  the  financial
   statements  of  prior  years  have not been  restated.   The  cumulative
   effect of the change was not material.

   Under  FAS  109,  deferred income taxes reflect the  future  income  tax
   effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of  assets
   and  liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their  tax  bases.
   Prior  to  1994,  the  Company  accounted for  income  taxes  under  the
   provisions  of APB Opinion No. 11, which recognized deferred  taxes  for
   the  effect  of timing differences between pretax accounting income  and
   taxable income.

   At  September  25,  1993, the significant components  of  the  Company's
   deferred tax assets and liabilities were:

   U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $211
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested  in  operations  outside of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely invested earnings, the Company provides federal  and  state
   income   taxes   currently   on  undistributed   earnings   of   foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The   Internal   Revenue  Service  has  proposed  federal   income   tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and the Company  has  made
   prepayments   thereon.    The  Company  has  contested   these   alleged
   deficiencies  and  is  pursuing administrative  and  judicial  remedies.
   Management  believes  that adequate provision  has  been  made  for  any
   adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

   3.  In  the  third  quarter of 1993, the Company  initiated  a  plan  to
   restructure  its  operations worldwide.  In connection with  this  plan,
   the  Company recorded a $321 million charge to operating expenses  ($199
   million,  or  $1.72  per share, after taxes).  The  restructuring  costs
   include  $162  million of estimated employee-related expenses  and  $159
   million   of   estimated  facilities,  equipment  and   other   expenses
   associated  with  the  consolidation,  relocation  and  termination   of
   operations and employees.

4. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options outstanding during the period.

5. Certain prior year amounts on the consolidated statements of cash  flows
   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

</TABLE>
Net  sales  for  the  first quarter of 1994 increased  by  23.4%  over  the
comparable period of 1993.  Total Macintosh(R) computer unit sales  increased
40%  in the first quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of 1993.  This
unit  sales growth principally resulted from strong sales of the  Company's
newer  product offerings within the LC, Performa(TM) and Quadra(R)  families  of
desktop  personal computers and within the PowerBook(TM) family  of  notebook-
sized  personal  computers.   This  unit growth  was  partially  offset  by
declining unit sales of certain of the Company's more established  products
and  older  product offerings.  The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh
computer unit declined 12% in the first quarter of 1994 over the comparable
period of 1993, primarily as a result of pricing actions undertaken by  the
Company  in response to continuing industrywide pricing pressures and  high
levels  of  inventory.   Going forward, the Company  anticipates  continued
industrywide competitive pricing and promotional actions.

International  net sales grew 24% and domestic net sales grew  23%  in  the
first quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of 1993.  The increase  in
international net sales primarily reflected strong net sales growth in  the
Pacific region.  Despite generally weak economic conditions and competitive
pressures  in  various  European countries, net sales  grew  moderately  in
Europe.  International net sales represented 45% of total net sales for the
first quarter of 1994, unchanged from the corresponding period of 1993.

The  Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its  first
quarter, compared with other quarters in its fiscal year, due to demand for
and  calendar  year-end buying of some of its products.  The  Company  does
not, however, consider its business to be highly seasonal.

It  is  anticipated  that  a significant portion of  the  Company's  future
revenues  will come from new products, especially personal computers  based
on  the  Power  PC  family  of  Reduced Instruction  Set  Computing  (RISC)
microprocessors.   However,  there can  be  no  assurance  that  these  new
products  will receive favorable market acceptance, and the Company  cannot
determine  the  ultimate effect these products will have on  its  sales  or
results  of  operations.  See "Factors That May Affect Future  Results  and
Financial Condition."

In general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-
needed  basis  due  to  the  Company's distribution  strategy,  which  is
designed to expedite the filling of orders.  Resellers frequently  change
delivery   schedules  and  order  rates  depending  on  changing   market
conditions.   Unfilled  orders ("backlog"),  which  are  not  necessarily
legally  binding, can be, and often are, canceled at will.  The Company's
backlog decreased to approximately $302 million at January 19, 1994, from
approximately $663 million at November 19, 1993, as the Company's  higher
inventory  levels provided greater product availability to meet  reseller
orders and delivery schedules.

                                        8
<PAGE>


In  the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any
particular  time  is not a meaningful indication of its  future  business
prospects.  Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors  affecting
the  Company's  backlog,  backlog should not  be  considered  a  reliable
indicator of the Company's future revenue or financial performance.

Gross Margin

Gross  margin  declined  both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during  the first quarter of 1994 from the comparable period of  1993.  The
decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result
of pricing and promotional actions undertaken by the Company in response to
industrywide pricing pressures (including the increasing price  competition
that the Company is experiencing in the Japanese market) and high levels of
inventory.   Gross  margin  was also adversely  affected  by  increases  in
inventory  valuation reserves associated with the high levels of inventory,
increased  costs  associated with providing customers a  wider  variety  of
product  configuration options, and a seasonal shift of product mix towards
lower margin products.

Gross margin was affected somewhat adversely by changes in foreign currency
exchange  rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative  to  certain
foreign  currencies  during the first quarter of  1994  compared  with  the
corresponding period of 1993.  The Company's operating strategy and pricing
take  into  account  changes  in exchange rates  over  time;  however,  the
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the  short
term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The  Company anticipates that gross margins will remain under pressure  and
below  historic  levels  worldwide due to a variety of  factors,  including
continued   industrywide  pricing  pressures,  increased  competition   and
compressed  product  cycles.  The Company's gross  margins  could  also  be
adversely  affected by inventory valuation reserves that  could  result  if
anticipated  unit  sales  growth projections for new  and  current  product
offerings are not realized.

Research  and development expenditures decreased both in amount  and  as  a
percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 1994 when compared with the
corresponding  period of 1993.  This decrease reflects the results  of  the
Company's  restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs,  including  more
focused product development expenditures.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and development
are  critical  to  its  future  growth  and  competitive  position  in  the
marketplace  and are directly related to continued, timely  development  of
new  and enhanced products.  However, in light of the Company's expectation
of  continued  pressure  on  gross margin,  the  Company  anticipates  that
research  and  development  expenditures will decrease  in  amount  as  the
Company  maintains its efforts to manage operating expense growth  relative
to gross margin levels during 1994.

quarter of 1994 when compared with the corresponding period of 1993.   This
decrease was primarily a result of the Company's ongoing efforts to  manage
operating expense growth relative to gross margin levels, and also  due  to
an increase in the level of net sales.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses relative  to  gross  margin  levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross  margin,  and  continued  weak economic  conditions  worldwide.   The
Company's  objective  is  to  continue  to  reduce  selling,  general   and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales during 1994.

first  quarter  of 1994 when compared with the same period in  1993.   This
decrease is primarily due to a non-recurring gain on the sale of certain of
the Company's venture capital investments in the first quarter of 1993,  an
increase  in  interest  expense due to higher  commercial  paper  borrowing
levels,  and a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates  and
lower cash balances.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

During the first half of calendar year 1994, the Company plans to introduce
its  first  Macintosh  computers based on a  new  PowerPC  family  of  RISC
microprocessors.   Accordingly, the Company's  results  of  operations  and
financial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  if  it  is  unable  to
successfully  transition  its  line  of Macintosh  personal  computers  and
servers  from the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors to  the  PowerPC
microprocessor.   The  success  of  this  transition  will  depend  on  the
Company's ability to continue the sales momentum of products based  on  the
Motorola  68000 series of microprocessors through the introduction  of  the
PowerPC-based  products, to successfully manage inventory  levels  of  both
product lines simultaneously, to gain market acceptance of the new PowerPC-
based  products, and to coordinate the timely development and  distribution
of  new  versions of commonly-used software products specifically  designed
for the PowerPC-based products.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected by a number of other factors, including the Company's ability  to:
increase  market share in its personal computer business while successfully
expanding  its  new  businesses and product offerings into  other  markets;
broaden   industry   acceptance  of  the  Newton  personal digital assistant 
(PDA) product, including effectively licensing Newton technology and 
marketing the related  products  and  services;  realize the  anticipated

                                       10
<PAGE>

cost-reduction benefits  associated  with its restructuring plan initiated  
in the  third quarter of 1993; develop, manufacture, and sell its products
profitably; reduce  existing  inventory  levels; and  manage  future  
inventory  levels effectively.  The  Company's  future  operating  results 
and   financial condition may also be affected by uncertainties relative to 
global economic conditions;  the  strength of its distribution channels; 
industry  factors; and the availability and cost of components.

The  personal  computer industry is highly volatile  and  continues  to  be
characterized  by  dynamic  customer demand patterns,  rapid  technological
advances,  frequent introduction of new products and product  enhancements,
and  industrywide competition resulting in aggressive pricing practices and
downward  pressure on gross margins.  The Company's operating  results  and
financial  condition  could be adversely affected  should  the  Company  be
unable to: accurately anticipate customer demand; introduce new products on
a timely basis; manage lead times required to obtain components in order to
be  more responsive to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns; offer
customers competitive technologies while effectively managing the impact on
inventory  levels  and  the  potential for customer  confusion  created  by
product  proliferation; effectively manage the impact  on  the  Company  of
industrywide  pricing pressures; or effectively implement  and  manage  the
competitive  risk  associated with certain of the  Company's  collaboration
agreements  with other companies, such as the agreements with International
Business  Machines Corporation (IBM).  The Company's results of  operations
and  financial  condition  could also be adversely  affected  by  inventory
valuation  reserves  that  could result if anticipated  unit  sales  growth
projections for new and current product offerings are not realized.

A large portion of the Company's revenues in recent years has come from its
international operations.  As a result, the Company's operating results and
financial  condition  could  be  significantly  affected  by  international
factors,  such  as  changes  in foreign currency  exchange  rates  or  weak
economic conditions in foreign markets in which the Company distributes its
products.   The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into  account
changes  in  exchange  rates over time; however, the Company's  results  of
operations  can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

During  the first quarter of 1994, the Company introduced several  products
that extend its entry-level, midrange and notebook computer offerings.   In
addition,  the  Company  introduced  several  new  or  enhanced  peripheral
products.   The success of these new products is dependent on a  number  of
factors,  including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage  the
risks  associated  with product transitions, and the Company's  ability  to
reduce existing inventory levels and manage future inventory levels in line
with  anticipated  product  demand  and  to  manufacture  the  products  in
appropriate  quantities  to  meet  anticipated  demand.   Accordingly,  the
Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products   will
have on its sales or results of operations.

The  Company's products include certain components, such as microprocessors
manufactured  by  Motorola  Inc.  and  monochrome  active-matrix   displays
manufactured by Hosiden Corporation, that are currently available only from
single  sources.  Any availability limitations, interruptions in  supplies,
or price increases of these and other components could adversely affect the
Company's business and financial results.

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near major earthquake faults. The Company's operating results and financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

A   number  of  uncertainties  also  exist  regarding  the  marketing   and
distribution  of  the Company's products.  The Company's primary  means  of
distribution  is  through  third-party  computer  resellers   and   various
education and consumer channels.  Although the Company has in place certain
policies  to  limit concentrations of credit risk, business  and  financial
results  could  be adversely affected in the event that the generally  weak
financial   condition  of  third-party  computer  resellers  worsens.    In
addition,  the  Company is continuing its expansion into  new  distribution
channels,  such  as mass-merchandise stores (such as Sears  and  Wal-Mart),
consumer  electronics  outlets, and computer superstores,  in  response  to
changing  industry practices and customer preferences.  At this  time,  the
Company  cannot  determine the ultimate effect of  these  or  other  future
distribution expansion efforts on its future operating results.

                                       11
<PAGE>

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

</TABLE>
The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments,  net of short-term borrowings  increased  to  $371
million  at  December  31, 1993 from $69 million  at  September  24,  1993.
Working  capital  increased to approximately $1.9 billion at  December  31,
1993, from $1.8 billion at September 24, 1993.

Operations  generated net cash of $367 million during the first quarter  of
1994,  compared  with $400 million used during the fourth quarter  of  1993.
This  improvement  was due primarily to decreases in inventory  levels  and
accounts  receivable.  Accounts receivable decreased by $134 million  as  a
result of improved collection activity.  Continued improvement in cash flow
from  operations for the remainder of 1994 will depend principally  on  the
Company's  ability  to  improve profit levels and the  Company's  continued
aggressive  management  of working capital, particularly  in  the  area  of
inventory management as the Company introduces its Power PC-based  personal
computers.

The  Company's inventory levels increased sequentially each quarter  during
fiscal  1993 from approximately $580 million at the end of fiscal  1992  to
approximately  $1.51 billion at the end of fiscal 1993 in  support  of  its
expanded  product  line  and distribution channels and  anticipated  higher
sales  volumes.   These higher levels of inventory, in  turn,  resulted  in
increased  levels  of short-term borrowings.  As of the end  of  the  first
quarter of fiscal 1994, inventory levels had declined by approximately $168
million  and  short-term borrowings had declined by $71  million  from  the
fiscal  1993  year-end levels, primarily as a result of improved  inventory
management  and  increased  sales resulting from  pricing  and  promotional
actions.   The Company has also identified additional measures  to  improve
management  of working capital, including the implementation  of  long-term
financing   arrangements,  and  long-term  measures  designed  to   improve
inventory   management,   such  as  increased  emphasis   on   designing-in
commonality  of  parts  among products, increased use of  manufacturing-on-
demand  based  on  products  orders  rather  than  forecasts,  and  greater
rationalization of product offerings.  Although the Company  believes  that
these  measures  will  result  in improved inventory  and  working  capital
management during 1994, there can be no assurance that these measures  will
be  successful or that inventory reserves will not be necessary  in  future
periods.

Net  cash  used  for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  totaled
approximately  $24 million during the first quarter of 1994  compared  with
$47  million  during  the fourth quarter of  1993.   These  purchases  were
primarily   of   manufacturing  machinery  and  equipment,  and   leasehold
improvements.   The Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1994
will be slightly below 1993 expenditures.

Short-term  borrowings at December 31, 1993 were approximately $71  million
lower  than  at September 24, 1993.  The Company's aggregate borrowings  at
December   31,   1993  were  approximately  $752  million,   comprised   of
approximately  $527  million  short-term  borrowings  in   the   U.S.   and
approximately  $225  million  short-term  borrowings  overseas.   Aggregate
borrowings at September 24, 1993 were $823 million.

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term
borrowings  from  time to time to finance U.S. working  capital  needs  and
capital expenditures, because substantially all of the Company's cash, cash
equivalents,  and  short-term investments is held by foreign  subsidiaries,
generally  in  U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held  by  foreign
subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation  to
the United States; the Company's financial statements fully provide for any
related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated.

The  Company's  short-term borrowings are principally under its  commercial
paper  program.   From time to time, the Company also  borrows  to  finance
operations  pursuant to short-term uncommitted bid-line  arrangements  with
commercial  banks.  During the first quarter of 1994, the  Company  entered
into a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of
banks  to  support its commercial paper program.  No borrowings  have  been
made  under this facility.  In addition, Apple Japan, Inc., a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of the Company, incurred short-term yen-denominated  borrowings
aggregating  the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $225 million  from
several Japanese banks.

On  May  5, 1993, the Company filed an omnibus shelf registration statement
with  the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration  of  debt
and other securities for an aggregate offering amount of $500 million.   On
January 24, 1994, the Company commenced marketing its first take-down under
this shelf registration statement in the aggregate principal amount of $300
million.  The Company believes that the shelf registration provides it with
additional financing flexibility to meet future funding requirements and to
take advantage of attractive market conditions.

In  January  1994, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company  exercised  its
option to purchase for $51.9 million the remaining partnership interest  in
the  Cupertino  Gateway Partners partnership, a general partnership,  which
owns  the  Company's  campus-type office facilities located  in  Cupertino,
California  (the  "Campus").  As a result of this purchase,  the  Company's
wholly  owned subsidiary now owns 100% of the right, title and interest  in
the  Campus. This transaction will be reflected in the Company's  financial
statements for the second quarter of 1994.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984 through 1988, which the Company is  contesting.   The
Company believes the resolution of any tax liability for these proposed tax
deficiencies  will  occur  over  the course  of  the  next  several  years.
Although  payment of any assessment is not required until the end  of  such
process,  the  Company elected to make a prepayment in April 1991  for  the
years  1984  through 1986, and a prepayment in May 1993 for the years  1987
through 1988.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future.

                        DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING TERMS

             SECTION 1.01.  Certain Defined Terms.  As used in this Agreement,
   the following terms shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be
      equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms

rate" (it is a rate set by BofA based upon various factors including BofA's
costs  and  desired return, general economic conditions and other  factors,
and  is  used  as a reference point for pricing some loans,  which  may  be
priced at, above, or below such announced rate); or






                                       20

the basis of quotations for such rates received by the Administrative Agent
from  three New York certificate of deposit dealers of recognized  standing
selected  by  the  Administrative Agent, in either  case  adjusted  to  the
nearest  1/4 of one percent or, if there is no nearest 1/4 of one  percent,
to the next higher 1/4 of one percent; or

   (c)     1/2 of one percent per annum above the most recent Federal Funds
Rate.

           "Alternate  Base Rate Advance" means a Syndicated Advance  which
bears interest as provided in Section 2.07(a).

           "Applicable Lending Office" means, with respect to each  Lender,

Advance,  and  such Lender's Eurodollar Lending Office in  the  case  of  a
Eurodollar Rate Advance and, in the case of an Auction Advance, the  office

Lender  as part of such Syndicated Borrowing when such Syndicated  Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

           (c)   Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from  a  Lender  prior  to the date of any Syndicated Borrowing  that  such
Lender  will  not make available to the Administrative Agent such  Lender's
ratable portion of such Syndicated Borrowing, the Administrative Agent  may
assume   that  such  Lender  has  made  such  portion  available   to   the
Administrative Agent on the date of such Syndicated Borrowing in accordance
with  subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, but without any obligation to do so, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If  and  to
the  extent  that  such Lender shall not have so made such ratable  portion
available  to  the  Administrative Agent,  such  Lender  and  the  Borrower
severally  agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith  on  demand
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from
the  date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount  is  repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case  of  the
Borrower,  the interest rate applicable at the time to Syndicated  Advances
comprising  such Syndicated Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such  Lender,
the  Federal  Funds Rate.  If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative
Agent  such  corresponding amount, such amount so repaid  shall  constitute
such  Lender's Syndicated Advance as part of such Syndicated Borrowing  for
purposes  of  this  Agreement, and the interest payable  thereon  shall  be
allocated  such  that  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  receive  (from  a
combination  of the sum, if any, paid to the Administrative Agent  by  such
Lender  pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence and any  interest
payment  made  by  the  Borrower)  an amount  equal  to  interest  on  such
Syndicated  Advance at the interest rate applicable thereto from  the  date
the corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent  to
the Borrower as contemplated by this Section


                                       28
<PAGE>

2.02(c)  to  and  including  the  date  such  amount  is  repaid   to   the
Administrative  Agent  by such Lender, and such Lender  shall  receive  the
balance of the interest payments made by the Borrower with respect to  such
Advance in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

           (d)  The failure of any Lender to make the Syndicated Advance to
be  made  by  it as part of any Syndicated Borrowing shall not relieve  any
other  Lender  of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its  Syndicated
Advance  on the date of such Syndicated Borrowing, but no Lender  shall  be
responsible  for  the  failure of any other Lender to make  the  Syndicated
Advance  to  be  made by such other Lender on the date  of  any  Syndicated
Borrowing.

           SECTION  2.03.   Auction Advances.  (a)  Each  Lender  severally
agrees that the Borrower may request that Auction Borrowings be made  under
this  Section 2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the  period
from  the  date  hereof  until the date occurring  10  days  prior  to  the
Termination  Date  in the case of Absolute Rate Auction Borrowings  and  35
days prior to the Termination Date in the case of LIBOR Auction Borrowings,
in  the manner set forth below; provided that, following the making of each
Auction  Borrowing, the aggregate amount of the Advances  then  outstanding
shall  not  exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of  the  Lenders
(computed  without  regard  to any Auction Reduction);  provided,  further,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at no time
shall  the sum of the number of Auction Borrowings which remain outstanding
plus the number of Interest Periods then in effect exceed fifteen (15).

        (i)      The  Borrower may request an Auction Borrowing under  this
     Section  2.03 by delivering to the Administrative Agent, by facsimile,
     telex  or  cable, confirmed immediately in writing,  a  notice  of  an
     Auction  Borrowing (a "Notice of Auction Borrowing"), in substantially
     the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, specifying the date (which shall be  a
     Business  Day) and aggregate amount of the proposed Auction Borrowing,
     the maturity date for repayment of each Auction Advance to be made  as
     part of such Auction Borrowing (which maturity date (x) in the case of
     Absolute  Rate  Auction Borrowings may not be earlier  than  the  date
     occurring  7  days after the date of such Auction Borrowing  or  later
     than  180  days  after  the  date of such  Auction  Borrowing  or  the
     Termination Date, whichever occurs first, or (y) in the case of  LIBOR
     Auction Borrowings shall be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months, but in no event
     shall  be  later  than  the Termination Date),  whether  the  proposed
     Auction  Borrowing is to be an Absolute Rate Auction  Borrowing  or  a
     LIBOR  Auction Borrowing, the interest payment date or dates  relating
     thereto, the Borrower's commercial paper ratings from S&P and  Moody's
     in effect on the date of such proposed Auction Borrowing and any other
     terms  to  be  applicable to such Auction Borrowing,  not  later  than
     8:00 A.M. (San Francisco time) (A) at least one Business Day prior  to
     the  date  of the proposed Auction Borrowing, in the case of  Absolute
     Rate Auction Borrowings, and (B) at least four Business Days prior  to
     the  date  of  the proposed Auction Borrowing, in the  case  of  LIBOR
     Auction  Borrowings.  The Administrative Agent shall in turn  promptly
     notify  each Lender of each request for an Auction Borrowing  received
     by  it  from the Borrower by sending such Lender a copy of the related
     Notice of Auction Borrowing.

      (ii)     Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do
     so,  irrevocably  offer to make one or more Auction  Advances  to  the
     Borrower as part of such proposed Auction Borrowing at a rate or rates
     of  interest  specified  by such Lender in  its  sole  discretion,  by
     notifying  the  Administrative Agent (which shall give  prompt  notice
     thereof to the Borrower) before 6:45 A.M. (San Francisco time) (A)  on
     the  date of such proposed Auction Borrowing, in the case of a  Notice
     of Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A) of

                                       29
<PAGE>

     paragraph  (i) above and (B) three Business Days before  the  date  of
     such  proposed Auction Borrowing, in the case of a Notice  of  Auction
     Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (i) above,  of
     the  amount of each Auction Advance which such Lender would be willing
     to make as part of such proposed Auction Borrowing (which amounts may,
     subject   to  the  first  proviso  to  the  first  sentence  of   this
     Section  2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment), the rate or  rates
     of  interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office with
     respect  to  such Auction Advance; provided that if the Administrative
     Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect
     to  make  any such offer, it shall notify the Borrower of  such  offer
     before  6:15 A.M. (San Francisco time) on the date on which notice  of
     such  election is to be given to the Administrative Agent by the other
     Lenders.  Any notice of bid submitted by a Lender shall be disregarded
     if  it  (x) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language,  (y)
     proposes  terms other than or in addition to those set  forth  in  the
     applicable Notice of Auction Borrowing, or (z) arrives after the  time
     set forth in this paragraph (ii).

     (iii)      The  Borrower  shall, in turn, (A) before  8:00  A.M.  (San
     Francisco time) on the date of such proposed Auction Borrowing, in the
     case of a Notice of Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A)
     of  paragraph (i) above and (B) before 9:00 A.M. (San Francisco  time)
     three   Business  Days  before  the  date  of  such  proposed  Auction
     Borrowing,  in  the  case of a Notice of Auction  Borrowing  delivered
     pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (i) above, either

                (x)   cancel  such  Auction Borrowing  by  giving       the
     Administrative Agent notice to that effect, or

                (y)  accept one or more of the offers made by any Lender or
          Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole discretion,
          by  giving  notice to the Administrative Agent of the  amount  of
          each  Auction Advance to be made by each Lender as part  of  such
          Auction  Borrowing,  and  reject any  remaining  offers  made  by
          Lenders   pursuant  to  paragraph  (ii)  above  by   giving   the
          Administrative  Agent  notice  to  that  effect;  provided   that
          acceptance  of offers may only be made on the basis of  ascending
          interest   rates   specified   by   the   Lenders   pursuant   to
          paragraph (ii) above.

       (iv)     If the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that such
     Auction  Borrowing is canceled pursuant to paragraph  (iii)(x)  above,
     the  Administrative  Agent shall give prompt  notice  thereof  to  the
     Lenders and such Auction Borrowing shall not be made.

        (v)      If  offers are made by two or more Lenders with  the  same
     specified  rate  of interest for a greater aggregate principal  amount
     than  the  amount  in  respect of which offers are  accepted  for  any
     Auction Borrowing, the principal amount of Auction Advances in respect
     of   which  such  offers  are  accepted  shall  be  allocated  by  the
     Administrative Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such
     multiples  of  $1,000,000  as  the  Administrative  Agent   may   deem
     appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount  of  such
     offers.  Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts  of
     Auction Advances shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

       (vi)      If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers made  by
     any  Lender  or  Lenders  pursuant to paragraph  (iii)(y)  above,  the
     Administrative  Agent shall in turn promptly notify  (A)  each  Lender
     that  has made an offer as described in paragraph (ii) above,  of  the
     date and aggregate amount of such Auction Borrowing and whether or not


                                       30
<PAGE>

     any  offer  or  offers made by such Lender pursuant to paragraph  (ii)
     above have been accepted by the Borrower, and (B) each Lender that  is
     to  make an Auction Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing, of  the
     amount  of each Auction Advance to be made by such Lender as  part  of
     such  Auction  Borrowing.  Each Lender that  is  to  make  an  Auction
     Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing shall, before 9:00 A.M. (San
     Francisco time) on the date of such Auction Borrowing specified in the
     notice  received from the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause  (A)
     of  the  preceding  sentence, make available for the  account  of  its
     Applicable  Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at its  address
     referred  to in Section 8.02(b) such Lender's portion of such  Auction
     Borrowing,  in  same day funds.  Upon satisfaction of  the  applicable
     conditions  set  forth  in  Article  III  and  after  receipt  by  the
     Administrative Agent of such funds, the Administrative Agent will make
     such  funds  available to the Borrower at an account of  the  Borrower
     designated from time to time in writing by the Borrower and agreed  to
     by  the  Administrative Agent.  Promptly after each Auction  Borrowing
     the  Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the amount of the
     Auction Borrowing, the consequent Auction Reduction and the dates upon
     which such Auction Reduction commenced and will terminate.

        (b)     Each Auction Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount  not
less  than  $25,000,000, or an integral multiple of  $1,000,000  in  excess
thereof,  and, following the making of each Auction Borrowing, the Borrower
shall  be in compliance with the limitation set forth in the first  proviso
to the first sentence of subsection (a) above.

        (c)      Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in  this
Section  2.03,  the  Borrower  may from time  to  time  borrow  under  this
Section  2.03,  repay  or  prepay pursuant to  subsection  (d)  below,  and
reborrow under this Section 2.03, provided that an Auction Borrowing  shall
not  be  made  within two Business Days of the date of  any  other  Auction
Borrowing.

       (d)     The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the
account  of  each Lender which has made an Auction Advance, or  each  other
holder  of  an  Auction Note, on the maturity date of each Auction  Advance
(such  maturity date being that specified by the Borrower for repayment  of
such  Auction Advance in the related Notice of Auction Borrowing  delivered
pursuant  to subsection (a)(i) above), the then unpaid principal amount  of
such  Auction  Advance.  The Borrower shall have no  right  to  prepay  any
principal amount of any Auction Advance unless, and then only on the terms,
specified by the Borrower for such Auction Advance in the related Notice of
Auction  Borrowing  delivered  pursuant to  subsection  (a)(i)  above,  and
provided  that  the  Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse  each  Lender
whose  Auction Advance has been prepaid by the Borrower in respect  thereof
pursuant to Section 8.04(b).

        (e)      The  Borrower shall pay interest on the  unpaid  principal
amount of each Auction Advance from the date of such Auction Advance to the
date the principal amount of such Auction Advance is repaid in full, at the
rate  of  interest for such Auction Advance specified by the Lender  making
such  Auction Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant
to  subsection (a)(ii) above, payable on the maturity date specified by the
Borrower  for such Auction Advance and on each other interest payment  date
or  dates specified by the Borrower for such Auction Advance in the related
Notice  of Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above;
provided,  however,  that  if the maturity date  of  the  Auction  Advances
comprising an Auction Borrowing is more than three months after the date of
such  Auction Borrowing, then interest shall be payable on each  day  which
occurs  at  intervals  of  three months after  the  date  of  such  Auction
Borrowing; provided, further, that any amount of principal which

                                       31
<PAGE>

is  not  paid  when  due (whether at stated maturity,  by  acceleration  or
otherwise) shall bear interest, from the date on which such amount  is  due
until  such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per  annum
equal  at all times (i) from such due date to the applicable maturity date,
to  2% per annum above the interest rate otherwise payable with respect  to
such  Auction  Advance  hereunder, and (ii) from and after  the  applicable
maturity date, to 2% per annum above the Alternate Base Rate in effect from
time to time.

      SECTION 2.04. Fees.  (a) Facility Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a facility fee on
the  daily average amount of such Lender's Commitment (including  both  the
portion  thereof that is used and the portion thereof that is unused)  from
the  date  hereof in the case of each Lender listed on the signature  pages
hereof  and  from  the effective date of the assignment in accordance  with
Section  8.07 hereof pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender  in  the
case  of each other Lender until the Termination Date, payable on the  last
day  of  each March, June, September and December during the term  of  such
Lender's  Commitment, commencing December 31, 1993, and on the  Termination
Date,  at  the rate of (w) .08% per annum during each Level I  Period,  (x)
.10% per annum during each Level II Period, (y) .125% during each Level III
Period, and (z) .25% per annum during each Level IV Period.

      (b)   Agents'  Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay the following  fees:
(i)   to  Citicorp for Citicorp's own account a fee in respect of its  role
hereunder and in connection with the arrangement hereof in an amount and at
the  times  set  forth  in the letter agreement between  the  Borrower  and
Citicorp dated as of October 8, 1993, as the same may be amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time by the mutual agreement  of  the
Borrower and Citicorp; (ii) to BofA for BofA's own account a fee in respect
of  its role hereunder and in connection with the arrangement hereof in  an
amount  and  at  the  times set forth in the letter agreement  between  the
Borrower and BofA dated as of October 14, 1993, as the same may be amended,
modified,  supplemented  or  replaced from  time  to  time  by  the  mutual
agreement  of the Borrower and BofA; and (iii) to the Administrative  Agent
for  its own account an auction fee of $2500 in respect of and at the  time
of each Notice of Auction Borrowing delivered to the Administrative Agent.

      SECTION 2.05.  Reduction of the Commitments.  The Borrower shall have
the  right,  upon at least three Business Days' irrevocable notice  to  the
Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in  part  the
unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders, provided that
the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced
to  an  amount  which is less than the aggregate principal  amount  of  the
Auction  Advances then outstanding and provided, further, that each partial
reduction  shall be in the aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or  an  integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

      SECTION 2.06.  Repayment of Syndicated Advances.  The Borrower  shall
repay  the principal amount of each Syndicated Advance made by each  Lender
on  the last day of the Interest Period for such Syndicated Advance or  the
Termination Date, whichever occurs first.

      SECTION  2.07.  Interest on Syndicated Advances.  The Borrower  shall
pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Syndicated Advance made
by  each  Lender  from  the  date  of such Syndicated  Advance  until  such
principal  amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates  per  annum
and at the following times:  (a) if such Syndicated Advance is an Alternate
Base  Rate  Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to  the  Alternate
Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable quarterly on the last day of
each March, June, September, and December and on

                                       32
<PAGE>

the date such Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be paid in full; and (b) if
such  Syndicated  Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a  rate  per  annum
equal  at all times during the Interest Period for such Syndicated  Advance
to  the  sum  of  the  Eurodollar Rate for such Interest  Period  plus  the
applicable  Eurodollar Margin, payable on the last  day  of  such  Interest
Period  and,  if such Interest Period is longer than three (3)  months,  at
intervals  of  three (3) months after the first day thereof; provided  that
any amount of principal or interest which is not paid when due (whether  at
stated  maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear  interest,  from
the  date  on which such amount is due until such amount is paid  in  full,
payable  on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per  annum
above the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time.

      SECTION  2.08.  Notes.  The obligation of the Borrower to  repay  the
Syndicated Advances made to the Borrower by each Lender hereunder shall  be
further evidenced by a Syndicated Note in favor of such Lender in the  form
and  substance  of  Exhibit A-1 attached hereto.   The  obligation  of  the
Borrower  to repay the Auction Advances made to the Borrower by any  Lender
shall  be evidenced by an Auction Note in favor of such Lender in the  form
and substance of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto.

      SECTION  2.09.   Interest Rate Determination.  (a) The Administrative
Agent  shall  give  prompt notice to the Borrower and the  Lenders  of  the
applicable  interest  rate  determined  by  the  Administrative  Agent  for
purposes  of  Section  2.07; provided, however, that  any  failure  by  the
Administrative Agent to provide such notice shall not affect any obligation
of the Borrower or the Lenders hereunder.

        (b)      If  the Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business  Day
before  the  date  of  any  requested  Syndicated  Borrowing  comprised  of
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  notify  the  Administrative  Agent  that   the
Eurodollar  Rate  for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising  such  Syndicated
Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders  of
making,  funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar  Rate  Advances
for such Syndicated Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith  so
notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon the right of the Borrower to
select  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances for such  Syndicated  Borrowing  or  any
subsequent Syndicated Borrowing shall be suspended until the Administrative
Agent  shall  notify  the Borrower and the Lenders that  the  circumstances
causing  such  suspension  no  longer exist, and  each  Syndicated  Advance
comprising  such  Syndicated Borrowing shall  be  an  Alternate  Base  Rate
Advance.

      SECTION 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall  obtain
any  payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise  of  any
right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Syndicated Advances  made
by  it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12) in excess of its ratable share
of  payments  on  account of the Syndicated Advances obtained  by  all  the
Lenders,  such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders  such
participations  in  the  Syndicated Advances  made  by  them  as  shall  be
necessary  to  cause  such purchasing Lender to share  the  excess  payment
ratably with each of them, provided, however, that if all or any portion of
such  excess  payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing  Lender,
such  purchase  from each Lender shall be rescinded and such  Lender  shall
repay  to  the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent  of  such
recovery  together  with  an amount equal to such  Lender's  ratable  share
(according  to  the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's  required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender)
of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in
respect  of  the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees  that  any
Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to

                                       33
<PAGE>

this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all
its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation  as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor  of  the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

      SECTION 2.11.  Prepayments of Advances.  (a) The Borrower shall  have
no  right  to  prepay any principal amount of any Advances  other  than  as
provided in subsection (b) and subsection (c) below.

        (b)      The  Borrower  may,  upon  at  least  two  Business  Days'
irrevocable  notice, or in the case of Syndicated Borrowings  comprised  of
Alternate  Base Rate Advances notice given not later than one Business  Day
prior  to  the  proposed  date of prepayment, to the  Administrative  Agent
stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment,
and  if  such  notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay  the  outstanding
principal  amounts of the Syndicated Advances comprising part of  the  same
Syndicated  Borrowing  in whole or ratably in part, together  with  accrued
interest  to  the date of such prepayment on the principal amount  prepaid;
provided,  however,  that  (x)  each partial  prepayment  shall  be  in  an
aggregate  principal  amount  not  less than  $25,000,000  or  an  integral
multiple  of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (y) in the case of any  such
prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to
reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(b).

     (c)  Except as provided in Section 2.03(d), the Borrower shall have no
right to prepay any principal amount of any Auction Advance.

     SECTION 2.12.  Increased Costs.  (a) If, after the date hereof, due to
either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by  way
of  imposition  or  increase  of  reserve  requirements,  in  the  case  of
Eurodollar   Rate  Advances,  included  in  the  Eurodollar  Rate   Reserve
Percentage)  in  or  in  the interpretation of any  law  or  regulation  or
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank  or
other  governmental  authority (whether or not having the  force  of  law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender (or to any commercial
bank  Affiliate  of  any non-bank Lender) of agreeing to  make  or  making,
funding  or  maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower  shall
from  time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such  demand
to  the  Administrative  Agent), pay to the Administrative  Agent  for  the
account  of  such  Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate  such
Lender  or  Affiliate  for such increased cost.  A certificate  as  to  the
amount  of  such  increased  cost,  submitted  to  the  Borrower  and   the
Administrative  Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and  binding  for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

        (b)      If any Lender determines that compliance with any  law  or
regulation  or  any  guideline or request from any central  bank  or  other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects the
amount  of  capital  to  be maintained by such Lender  or  any  corporation
controlling  such Lender or any commercial bank Affiliate of  any  non-bank
Lender  and  that the amount of such capital is increased by or based  upon
the  existence  of  such Lender's commitment to lend  hereunder  and  other
commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy  of
such  demand  to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall  immediately
pay  to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, from  time
to  time  as  specified  by such Lender, additional amounts  sufficient  to
compensate  such Lender or such corporation or Affiliate in  the  light  of
such  circumstances,  to the extent that such Lender reasonably  determines
such  increase  in capital is allocable to the existence of  such  Lender's
commitment  to lend hereunder.  A certificate as to such amounts  submitted
to the Borrower and

                                       34
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

      SECTION  2.13.  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other  provision  of
this  Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative  Agent  that
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation  makes  it unlawful, or any central bank or  other  governmental
authority  asserts  that it is unlawful, for any Lender or  its  Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the
obligation  of  the  Lenders  to make Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  shall  be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and  the
Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist  and
(ii)  the  Borrower  shall  forthwith prepay in full  all  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances  of  all Lenders then outstanding, together with interest  accrued
thereon.

     SECTION 2.14.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make
each  payment hereunder and under the Notes not later than 10:00 A.M.  (San
Francisco  time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the  Administrative
Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02(b) in same day funds.  The
Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed  like
funds  relating  to the payment of principal or interest  or  fees  ratably
(other  than  amounts  payable pursuant to Section 2.03  or  2.12)  to  the
Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and
like  funds  relating  to the payment of any other amount  payable  to  any
Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,  in
each  case  to  be applied in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement.
Upon  its  acceptance of an assignment pursuant to Section 8.07,  from  and
after  the  effective date specified in such assignment, the Administrative
Agent  shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect  of
the  interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder,  and  the
parties  to such assignment shall make all appropriate adjustments in  such
payments  for  periods  prior  to  such  effective  date  directly  between
themselves.
        (b)     All computations of interest and of fees  shall be made  by
the  Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each  case
for  the  actual number of days (including the first day but excluding  the
last  day)  occurring  in the period for which such interest  or  fees  are
payable.   Each  determination by the Administrative Agent of  an  interest
rate  or  fee  amount  hereunder shall be conclusive and  binding  for  all
purposes, absent manifest error.
        (c)     Whenever any payment hereunder and under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall  be
made  on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall
in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees,
as  the  case  may  be;  provided, however, if such extension  would  cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be  made
in  the  next following calendar month, such payment shall be made  on  the
next preceding Business Day.
        (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from  the  Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is  due  to  the
Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment  in
full  to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
may,  in  reliance  upon such assumption, cause to be distributed  to  each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.
If  and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment
in  full  to  the  Administrative Agent, each Lender  shall  repay  to  the
Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed  to  such
Lender  together  with interest thereon, for each day from  the  date  such
amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION  4.01.   Representations  and Warranties  of  the  ;Borrower.   The
Borrower represents and warrants as follows:;

   (a)The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good  standing under the laws of the State of California.  Each  Subsidiary
is  duly  organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction
in  which it is incorporated and is in good standing under the laws of such
jurisdiction except where the failure to so be in good standing (i) is  due
to a filing omission or other technical noncompliance which can be remedied
in  a  short  period  of time (and in any event within fifteen  (15)  days)
without  incurring  any  substantial cost, (ii)  is  remedied  as  soon  as
possible  and in any event within fifteen (15) days after the Borrower  has
knowledge  of  any  such failure, or (iii) such failure  will  not  have  a
material  adverse effect on the business, condition (financial  or  other),
assets, properties, operations or prospects of the Borrower or the Borrower
and  its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  The Borrower and each  Subsidiary
has  the corporate power to own its respective property and to carry on its
respective business as now being conducted.

   (b)The  execution,  delivery and performance by  the  Borrower  of  this
Agreement  and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate  powers,  have
been  duly  authorized  by  all  necessary corporate  action,  and  do  not
contravene  (i) the Borrower's charter or by-laws, or (ii) any  law,  rule,
regulation or contractual restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower,
or  constitute a default under any judgment, decree, order or award of  any
court  or  agency  of  government  or any  arbitrator,  or  any  indenture,
agreement or any other instrument to which the Borrower is a party, and  do
not  and will not result in the creation or imposition of any lien  on  any
asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

   (c)No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to  or
filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required  for
the  due  execution,  delivery and performance  by  the  Borrower  of  this
Agreement or the Notes.

                                       37

legal,  valid  and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable  against
the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

   (e)The  audited  consolidated balance sheet  of  the  Borrower  and  its
Subsidiaries  as  at  September 25, 1992, and  the  unaudited  consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at June 25, 1993, and
the  related audited or unaudited (as the case may be) statements of income
and  stockholders'  equity  of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  for  the
respective  fiscal periods then ended, copies of which have been  furnished
to  each Lender, fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries  as  of  such respective dates and  the  results  of  the
operations  of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the periods  ended  on
such respective dates, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied.

  (f)Except as disclosed to the Documentation Agent and the Lenders in that
certain  letter  dated December 6, 1993, there is no  pending  or,  to  the
knowledge  of  the Borrower, threatened action or proceeding affecting  the
Borrower  or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental  agency
or arbitrator, which (i) is more likely than not to be adversely determined
and  such  adverse determination is reasonably likely to  have  a  material
adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the Borrower  or
any  Subsidiary,  or  (ii)  purports to affect the  legality,  validity  or
enforceability of this Agreement or any Note.

   (g)The  Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending credit  for
the  purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning  of
Regulation  U  issued  by  the Board of Governors of  the  Federal  Reserve
System),  and no proceeds of any Advance will be used to purchase or  carry
any  margin  stock  or  to  extend credit to  others  for  the  purpose  of
purchasing or carrying any margin stock.

   (h)The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has met its minimum funding
requirements  under  ERISA with respect to all of its  Plans  and  has  not
incurred any material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
under  ERISA in connection with any such Plan.  No ERISA Termination  Event
has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Plan.

   (i)The Borrower is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled"
by  an  "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment  Company
Act of 1940, as amended.

  (j)The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, to the best of their knowledge, own
or  have  obtained the right to use all patents, trademarks, service-marks,
trade  names,  copyrights, licenses and other rights, free from  burdensome
restrictions,  or  could  obtain  the same  on  terms  and  conditions  not
materially  adverse  to  the  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  and   their
operations taken as a whole, that are necessary for the operation of  their
respective  businesses  as presently conducted and  for  the  operation  of
businesses described to the Lenders in writing as proposed to be conducted.

   (k)The  Borrower has and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Federal,
State  and  other tax returns which, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
are  required  to be filed, and each has paid all taxes as  shown  on  such
returns and on all assessments received by it to the extent that such

                                       38
<PAGE>

taxes  have  become due, except such taxes as are being contested  in  good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have  been
established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

   (l)No  information, exhibit or report furnished by the Borrower  to  the
Agent or Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or the
Notes or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Notes contains  any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state a material fact or any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

  (m)Listed on Exhibit F attached hereto are all of the Subsidiaries of the
Borrower  as  of  the  date  of  this Agreement.  All  of  the  issued  and
outstanding  shares of the capital stock of each Subsidiary  owned  by  the
Borrower or any Subsidiary are duly issued and outstanding, fully paid  and
non-assessable and are free and clear of any lien, change or encumbrance.

   (n)In  the  ordinary  course of its business, the Borrower  conducts  an
ongoing  review  of  the  effect of Environmental  Laws  on  the  business,
operations  and  properties of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries,  in  the
course  of  which  it identifies and evaluates associated  liabilities  and
costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures
required  for  clean-up  or  closure of  its  properties,  any  capital  or
operating  expenditures  required to achieve or  maintain  compliance  with
environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of  any
license,   permit  or  contract,  any  related  constraints  on   operating
activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or
reduction  in the level of or change in the nature of operations  conducted
thereat and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including
employees,  and  any related costs and expenses).  On  the  basis  of  this
review,  the Borrower has reasonably concluded that Environmental Laws  are
not  likely  to  have a material adverse effect on the business,  financial
condition,  results  of  operations or prospects of  the  Borrower  or  the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries considered as a whole.

      SECTION 4.02  Representation and Warranty of the Borrower at Closing.

material  and  adverse  change in the business, operations,  properties  or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or the Borrower and  its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(including,  without limitation, claims for labor, services, materials  and
supplies) for sums which have become due and payable and which by law  have
or  may  become a lien upon any of its properties or assets; provided  that
any such tax, assessment, charge or claim may be contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and if
such  accrual or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be  required
by generally accepted accounting principles shall have been made therefor.

   (c)Maintenance of Properties; Insurance; Books and Records.  Maintain or

Subsidiaries taken as a whole, provided that the corporate existence of any
Subsidiary  may  be  terminated  if, in the  good  faith  judgment  of  the
Borrower, such termination is in the best interests of the Borrower and  is
not disadvantageous to the Lenders.

     as a whole;

     (ix)  promptly upon the Borrower's obtaining knowledge thereof, notice

generally applicable for like visits.

suffer   to  exist,  any  lien,  security  interest  or  other  charge   or
encumbrance, or any other type of preferential arrangement, upon any of its
property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except

     (A)  liens for taxes not yet due or which are being actively contested
     in good faith by appropriate proceedings,

     (B)   other  liens  incidental to the conduct of its business  or  the
     ownership  of  its  property and assets which  were  not  incurred  in
     connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances of
     credit, and which do not in the aggregate materially detract from  the
     value  of its property or assets or materially impair the use of  such
     property or assets in the operation of its business,

     (C)   liens existing on the property or assets of the Borrower or  any
     Subsidiary on the date of this Agreement and set forth on Exhibit E,

     (D)  liens on property or assets of a Subsidiary to secure obligations

     (E)   any  lien  created  to  secure the purchase  price  or  cost  of
     construction, or to secure Debt incurred to pay the purchase price  or

     any  Subsidiary  after  the date hereof or any  improvements  to  real
     property  constructed by or for the account of  the  Borrower  or  any
     Subsidiary  after  the date hereof, provided that (1)  any  such  lien
     shall  be confined solely to the item or items of property so acquired
     or  constructed (and any theretofore unimproved real property on which
     such improvements are located), and (2) any such lien shall be created
     concurrently with or within twelve months following the acquisition of
     such  property  or  the  completion of  construction  of  improvements
     thereon,

     (F)   liens  existing on property including the proceeds  thereof  and
     accessions   thereto  acquired  by  the  Borrower  or  any  Subsidiary

     corporation becoming a Subsidiary),

     (G)  liens which constitute rights of set-off of a customary nature or
     bankers' liens with respect to amounts on deposit, whether arising  by
     operation  of  law  or  by contract, in connection  with  arrangements

     rights  of  set-off created pursuant to or by virtue of this Agreement
     and the Notes,

     (H)  liens on any of its notes or accounts receivable except for liens

     permitted under Section 5.02(f), does not exceed, in the aggregate, an
     amount equal to $300,000,000; provided, however, if the aggregate face
     amount  of  the notes and accounts receivable so sold does not  exceed
     $300,000,000 but such amount so sold plus the aggregate face amount of
     such  notes and accounts receivable so encumbered by liens does exceed
     $300,000,000, no Event of Default shall occur hereunder  provided  the
     Borrower simultaneously therewith makes or causes to be made effective
     provision whereby the indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement and the
     Notes will be secured by such liens

                                       43

     (pursuant   to   documentation  in  form  and   substance   reasonably
     satisfactory to the Majority Lenders) equally and ratably with any and
     all  Debt  thereby  secured so long as such other  Debt  shall  be  so
     secured, and

     (I)   any  lien  renewing, extending, or refunding any lien  permitted
     under  clauses  (A) through (H), inclusive, of this  Section  5.02(a),
     provided  that the principal amount secured is not increased and  that
     such  lien  is not extended to other property (other than pursuant  to
     its original terms).

(ii)   Notwithstanding the provisions contained in subdivision (i) of  this
Section 5.02(a), in addition to the permitted liens described in clause (E)
of  Section  5.02(a)  above, the Borrower or any of  its  Subsidiaries  may
create,  assume or suffer to exist liens on any real property now owned  or
hereafter  acquired  by the Borrower or such Subsidiary  if,  after  giving
effect  thereto,  the total amount of Debt secured by such liens  permitted
pursuant  to this subdivision (ii) of this Section 5.02(a) does not  exceed
an  amount equal to $200,000,000; provided, however, if the total amount of
Debt  secured by such liens exceeds $200,000,000, no Event of Default shall
occur  hereunder  provided the Borrower simultaneously therewith  makes  or
causes to be made effective provision whereby the indebtedness evidenced by
this  Agreement  and the Notes will be secured by such liens  (pursuant  to
documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Majority
Lenders) equally and ratably with any and all other Debt thereby secured so
long as such other Debt shall be so secured.

   (b)Merger and Consolidation.  Merge into or consolidate with or  into  a
corporation,  or  permit  any Subsidiary to do  so,  except  that  (i)  any
Subsidiary  may  merge  or consolidate with any other  Subsidiary  and  any
Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower, and (ii) the Borrower may merge  or
consolidate  with any other corporation provided that (A)  either  (1)  the
Borrower  shall  be  the continuing or surviving corporation,  or  (2)  the
successor  corporation shall be a solvent corporation organized  under  the
laws  of  any State of the United States of America with a senior unsecured
long  term debt rating from S & P of at least BBB+ and from Moody's  of  at
least  Baa1, and such corporation shall expressly assume in writing all  of
the  obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and under the  Notes,
including  all  covenants  herein and therein contained,  which  assumption
shall  not  otherwise  violate any term, condition  or  provision  of  this
Agreement  or  the Notes, and such successor shall be substituted  for  the
Borrower  with the same effect as if it had been named herein  as  a  party
hereto,  and  (B)  immediately  after  giving  effect  to  such  merger  or
consolidation,  no  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred;
provided,  however,  that  no Default or Event of Default  hereunder  shall
occur  as  a  result  of  the  noncompliance by  any  Subsidiary  with  the
provisions  of  this Section 5.02(b), Section 5.02(c), Section  5.02(d)  or
Section  5.02(e)  so  long  as  (x)  the  aggregate  total  assets  of  all
Subsidiaries which have at any time failed to comply with one  or  more  of
the foregoing sections does not exceed the lesser of $200,000,000 or 4%  of
the consolidated total assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (y)
the aggregate annual gross revenues of all such Subsidiaries which have  so
failed  to comply does not exceed 5% of the consolidated gross revenues  of
the  Borrower  and  its Subsidiaries for the most recent period  of  twelve
consecutive months.

    (c)Change   in  Nature  of  Business.   Subject  to  the   proviso   to

                                       44
<PAGE>

or  otherwise  dispose of any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary  or
permit any Subsidiary to issue, sell or otherwise dispose of any shares  of
its capital stock or the capital stock of any other Subsidiary, except

               (i)  to the Borrower or another Subsidiary;

               (ii)  that all shares of stock and Debt of any Subsidiary at
          the  time owned by or owed to the Borrower or any Subsidiary  may
          be  sold as an entirety for a cash consideration which represents
          the  fair value (as determined in good faith by the Borrower)  at
          the  time  of  sale  of the shares of stock  and  Debt  so  sold,
          provided  that,  at the time of such sale, such Subsidiary  shall
          not  own, directly or indirectly, (a) any shares of stock or Debt
          of  any  other Subsidiary (unless all of the shares of stock  and
          Debt  of such other Subsidiary owned, directly or indirectly,  by
          the  Borrower or any Subsidiary are simultaneously being sold  as
          permitted  by  this  Section 5.02(d)), or (b)  any  Debt  of  the
          Borrower; and

                (iii)   shares of stock of any Subsidiary may be  sold  if,
          after  giving effect to such sale, such Subsidiary shall continue
          to be a Subsidiary.

   (e)Sales,  Etc.  of Assets.  Subject to the proviso to Section  5.02(b),
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or permit any Subsidiary  to
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all  of
its  assets  (in  a single transaction or series of related  transactions),
other than in the ordinary course of business, except that:

                (i)   any Subsidiary may sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
          dispose  of  any  of  its assets to the Borrower  or  to  another
          Subsidiary;

               (ii)  any Subsidiary may sell or otherwise dispose of all or
          substantially  all  of  its assets as  an  entirety  for  a  cash
          consideration  which represents the fair value (as determined  in
          good  faith by the Borrower) at the time of sale of such  assets;
          and

                 (iii)   the  Borrower  may  sell  or  dispose  of  all  or
          substantially  all  of  its  assets  to  any  other  corporation,
          provided  that  (A)  the  acquiring corporation,  following  such
          acquisition, shall be a solvent corporation organized  under  the
          laws  of any State of the United States of America with a  senior
          unsecured long term debt rating from S & P of at least  BBB+  and
          from  Moody's  of  at least Baa1, and such acquiring  corporation
          shall  expressly assume in writing all of the obligations of  the
          Borrower under this Agreement and under the Notes, including  all
          covenants  herein  and therein contained, which assumption  shall
          not  otherwise violate any term, condition or provision  of  this
          Agreement  or  the  Notes, and such acquiring  corporation  shall
          succeed  to  and be substituted for the Borrower  with  the  same
          effect  as  if  it  had  been named herein  as  a  party  hereto,
          provided,  however, that no such sale shall release the  Borrower
          from  any of its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement
          or  under  the Notes unless such sale is followed by the complete
          liquidation of the Borrower and substantially all the  assets  of
          the  Borrower  are  distributed in such liquidation  as  soon  as
          reasonably  possible (but not more than fifteen  days)  following
          such  sale, and (B) immediately after giving effect to such  sale
          or  disposition,  no  Default  or Event  of  Default  shall  have
          occurred.

   (f)Sale  of  Receivables.  Sell with recourse, or discount or  otherwise
sell for less than the face

                                       45
<PAGE>

value  thereof,  or  sell with or without recourse for consideration  other
than  cash, or permit any Subsidiary to sell with recourse, or discount  or
otherwise  sell  for  less than the face value thereof,  or  sell  with  or
without  recourse for consideration other than cash, any of  its  notes  or
accounts  receivable; provided, that the foregoing restrictions  shall  not
apply to any sale of notes or accounts receivable if, on and as of the date
of  such sale and after giving effect thereto, the aggregate face amount of
all  the  notes or accounts receivable so sold after the date hereof,  plus
the face amount of notes and accounts receivable subject to liens permitted
pursuant to clause (H) of Section 5.02(a)(i) as of such date of sale,  does
not exceed $300,000,000; provided, however, if the aggregate face amount of
the notes and accounts receivable so sold does not exceed $300,000,000, but
such  amount  so  sold plus the aggregate face amount  of  such  notes  and
accounts  receivable  so encumbered by liens does exceed  $300,000,000,  no
Event of Default shall occur hereunder provided the Borrower simultaneously
therewith  makes  or  causes  to be made effective  provision  whereby  the
indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement and the Notes will be  secured  by
such  liens  (pursuant  to documentation in form and  substance  reasonably
satisfactory to the Majority Lenders) equally and ratably with any and  all
Debt  thereby  secured  so long as such other Debt  shall  be  so  secured.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing provisions of  this  Section  5.02(f),  but
without limiting the provisions of Section 5.02(a)(i)(H), the Borrower  and
the Subsidiaries may sell its notes or accounts receivable at a discount on
a  non-recourse basis to reflect the fair present value thereof, so long as
such discount shall be at a rate not in excess of the Alternate Base Rate.

Borrower  in  connection  with this Agreement  shall  prove  to  have  been
incorrect in any material respect when made; or

agreement contained in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) or Section  5.02;

   (d)the  Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any term, covenant  or
agreement  contained  in this Agreement (other than those  covered  by  the

shall remain unremedied for 30 days after written notice thereof shall have
been given to the Borrower by the Agent or any Lender; or

   (e)(i)  the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail  to  pay  any

$10,000,000  ("Material  Debt")  in  the  aggregate  (but  excluding   Debt
outstanding  hereunder), when the same becomes due and payable (whether  by
scheduled   maturity,   required  prepayment,   acceleration,   demand   or
otherwise), and such failure shall

                                       46

agreement or instrument relating to such Material Debt; or any other  event
shall  occur  or  condition shall exist under any agreement  or  instrument
relating  to any such Material Debt and shall continue after the applicable
grace  period, if any, specified in such agreement or instrument; but  only
if  the  effect of such failure to pay, event or condition is to accelerate
the  maturity  of such Material Debt; or any such Material  Debt  shall  be
declared  by the creditor to be due and payable, or required to be  prepaid
(other  than  by  a  regularly  scheduled required  prepayment),  redeemed,
purchased  or defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or  defease
such Material Debt shall be required to be made, in each case prior to  the

Borrower  or any of its Subsidiaries outstanding in a principal  amount  in
excess  of  $50,000,000  in  the aggregate and  shall  continue  after  the

debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in writing its inability  to
pay its debts generally, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit
of  creditors;  or  any proceeding shall be instituted by  or  against  the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries seeking to adjudicate it as bankrupt or
insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement,

law  relating  to  bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization  or  relief  of
debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment  of
a  receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for any
substantial  part of its property and, in the case of any  such  proceeding
instituted  against it (but not instituted by it), either  such  proceeding
shall  remain  undismissed  or  unstayed  for  a  period  of  thirty   (30)
consecutive  days,  or  any  of  the  actions  sought  in  such  proceeding
(including,  without limitation, the entry of an order for relief  against,
or  the  appointment  of a receiver, trustee, custodian  or  other  similar
official for, it or for any substantial part of its property) shall  occur;
or  the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall take any corporate action

then,  and  in  any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall  at  the
request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Borrower,  declare  the obligation of each Lender to make  Advances  to  be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at
the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to
the  Borrower,  declare the Advances, all interest thereon  and  all  other

whereupon the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become
and  be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest  or
further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower;  provided,  however, that if an Event  of  Default  specified  in
Section  6.01(f) shall occur, then, (A) the obligation of  each  Lender  to
make Advances shall automatically be terminated, and (B) the Advances,  all
such  interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and  be  due
and  payable,  without presentment, demand, protest or any  notice  of  any

                                    THE AGENT

      SECTION 7.01.  Authorization and Action.  Each Lender hereby appoints
and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and  to
exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent  by
the  terms  hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably  incidental
thereto.  As  to  any matters not expressly provided for by this  Agreement
(including,  without limitation, enforcement or collection of  the  amounts
payable hereunder and under the Notes), the Agent shall not be required  to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or
to  refrain  from  acting (and shall be fully protected  in  so  acting  or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders,  and
such  instructions  shall be binding upon all Lenders and  all  holders  of
Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take  any
action  which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is  contrary
to  this  Agreement or applicable law.  The Agent agrees to  give  to  each
Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.02.  Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-
fact  and  shall  be entitled to advice of counsel concerning  all  matters
pertaining  to  such  duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible  for  the
negligence  or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it  selects
with reasonable care.

      SECTION 7.03.  Agent's Reliance, Etc.  Neither the Agent nor  any  of
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement,  except  for  its  or  their own  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct.   Without limitation of the generality of  the  foregoing,  the
Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until  the
Agent  receives and accepts an assignment entered into by the Lender  which
is  the  payee of such Note, as assignor, and an assignee, as  provided  in
Section  8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including  counsel  for
the Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by
it  and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken  in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or  experts;  (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any  Lender  and
shall  not  be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties  or
representations  (whether written or oral) made in or  in  connection  with
this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any

                                       48
<PAGE>

duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of  any
of  the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the
Borrower  or  to inspect the property (including the books and records)  of
the  Borrower;  (v)  shall not be responsible to any  Lender  for  the  due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency  or
value  of  this  Agreement or any other instrument  or  document  furnished
pursuant  hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect  of
this  Agreement  by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate  or  other
instrument  or  writing  (which may be by telecopier,  telegram,  cable  or
telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper  party
or parties.

      SECTION  7.04.  Notice of Default.  Neither Agent shall be deemed  to
have  knowledge  or  notice of the occurrence of any Default  or  Event  of
Default,  except  with  respect to defaults in the  payment  of  principal,
interest  and  fees  required to be paid to such Agent, unless  such  Agent
shall  have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to  this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating
that  such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event that either Agent
receives  such notice, such Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.
The  Administrative  Agent  shall take such action  with  respect  to  such
Default  or Event of Default as shall be requested by the Majority  Lenders
in  accordance with Section 6.01; provided, however, that unless and  until
the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  received  any  such  request,  the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such  action,
or  refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or  Event
of  Default  as  it  shall deem advisable or in the best  interest  of  the
Lenders (but not including the actions reserved for the Majority Lenders in
said Section 6.01).

      SECTION 7.05.  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that
it  has,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent  or  any  other
Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01(e)
and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its  own  credit  analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each
Lender  also acknowledges that it will, independently and without  reliance
upon  the  Agent  or  any  other Lender and based  on  such  documents  and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make  its
own  credit  decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.
Except  for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein  required
to  be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have  any
duty  or  responsibility to provide any Lender with  any  credit  or  other
information  concerning  the  business,  prospects,  operations,  property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may
come into the possession of the Agent.

      SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify  each
Agent  and  their  respective Affiliates, officers,  directors,  employees,
agents  and  attorneys-in-fact ("Indemnified Persons") (to the  extent  not
reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective  principal
amounts  outstanding under the Syndicated Notes then held by each  of  them
(or  if  no  Syndicated  Advances are at the time  outstanding  or  if  any
Syndicated  Notes  are  held  by Persons which  are  not  Lenders,  ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against
any  and  all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind  or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
the  Indemnified Persons or any of them  in any way relating to or  arising
out  of  this  Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the  Indemnified
Persons or any of them under this Agreement, provided that no Lender  shall
be liable for any portion of such claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages,   penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,   expenses   or
disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct  of
an  Indemnified Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing,  each  Lender
agrees to

                                       49
<PAGE>

reimburse  the  Agent  promptly upon demand for its ratable  share  of  any
reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees)  and  allocated
costs  of  internal  counsel incurred by the Agent in connection  with  the
preparation,  execution, delivery, administration, modification,  amendment
or   enforcement  (whether  through  negotiations,  legal  proceedings   or
otherwise)  of,  or  legal advice in respect of rights or  responsibilities
under,  this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed  for
such expenses by the Borrower.

      SECTION  7.07.  Agent in Individual Capacity.  BofA and Citicorp  and
their respective Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit  for
the  account  of,  accept deposits from, acquire equity interests  in,  and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other
business  with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as  though
BofA  and  Citicorp respectively were not the Agent hereunder, and  without
notice  to  or  consent of the Lenders.  With respect to  their  respective
Advances,  BofA  and Citicorp shall have the same rights and  powers  under
this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though they
were not the Agent.

      SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may, and at the request of
the  Majority Lenders shall, resign as Agent at any time by giving  written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation,
the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If
no  successor  Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority  Lenders,
and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the
retiring  Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring  Agent
may,  on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be  a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or
of  any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$300,000,000  or  an  Affiliate  thereof.   Upon  the  acceptance  of   any
appointment  as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor  Agent
shall  thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent  shall
be  discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations  as  Agent  under  this
Agreement.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent,  the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.09.  The Agent.  Neither Agent shall be liable for any cost,
expense  (including,  without limitation, counsel fees and  disbursements),
claim, demand, action, loss or liability that the other Agent may suffer or
incur  in connection with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted  by
such  other Agent hereunder; provided, however, that the provisions of this
Section  7.09  shall  not affect the obligation of each Lender  (including,
without  limitation, each Agent in its capacity as a Lender  hereunder)  to
indemnify each Agent pursuant to Section 7.06 hereof.

     SECTION 7.10.  Withholding Tax.

        (a)      If  any  Lender is a "foreign corporation, partnership  or
trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Lender claims exemption from
United States withholding tax under Section 1441 or 1442 of the Code,  such
Lender agrees with and in favor of the Administrative Agent, to deliver  to
the Administrative Agent:  (i) if such Lender claims an exemption from,  or
a  reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly
completed IRS Forms 1001 and W-8 before the payment of any interest in  the
first  calendar year and before the payment of any interest in  each  third
succeeding  calendar  year during which interest may  be  paid  under  this
Agreement; (ii) if such Lender claims that interest paid under

                                       50
<PAGE>

this  Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it  is
effectively  connected  with a United States  trade  or  business  of  such
Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224  before
the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of such Lender
and  in  each succeeding taxable year of such Lender during which  interest
may  be  paid under this Agreement, and IRS Form W-9; and (iii) such  other
form or forms as may be required under the Code or other laws of the United
States  as  a  condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United  States
withholding  tax.  Such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Administrative
Agent  of any change in circumstances which would modify or render  invalid
any  claimed exemption or reduction.  In addition in the event  any  Lender
claims  exemption  from, or reduction of, withholding tax  under  a  United
States  tax  treaty  by  providing IRS Form 1001  and  such  Lender  sells,
assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or  part  of
the  obligations of the Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement,  such
Lender  agrees to notify the Administrative Agent of the percentage  amount
in  which  it  is  no  longer the beneficial owner of  obligations  of  the
Borrower  to  such  Lender under this Agreement.  To  the  extent  of  such
percentage  amount, the Administrative Agent will treat such  Lender's  IRS
Form  1001  as no longer valid.  In the event any Lender claiming exemption
from  United  States  withholding tax by filing  IRS  Form  4224  with  the
Administrative  Agent  sells,  assigns,  grants  a  participation  in,   or
otherwise transfers all or part of the obligations of the Borrower to  such
Lender  under  this  Agreement,  such  Lender  agrees  to  undertake   sole
responsibility for complying with the withholding tax requirements  imposed
by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

        (b)      If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding  tax, the Administrative Agent may withhold from  any  interest
payment  to  such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding
tax  after  taking  into account such reduction.  If  the  forms  or  other
documentation  required  by  subsection  (a)  are  not  delivered  to   the
Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may withhold  from  any
interest  payment  to  such  Lender  not  providing  such  forms  or  other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

       (c)     If the IRS or any other governmental authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative  Agent
did  not  properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account  of
any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered was not properly
executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative  Agent
of  a  change  in  circumstances  which rendered  the  exemption  from,  or
reduction  of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other  reason)  such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly  or  indirectly by the Administrative Agent as tax  or  otherwise,
including  penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed  by  any
jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under  this
Section  7.10,  together with all costs and expenses (including  attorney's
fees  and  costs).  The obligation of the Lenders in this subsection  shall
survive  the  payment of all obligations hereunder and the  resignation  or
replacement of the Administrative Agent.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      SECTION  8.01.   Amendments,  Etc.  No amendment  or  waiver  of  any
provision  of this Agreement or the Notes, nor consent to any departure  by
the  Borrower  therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless  the  same
shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders, and

                                       51
<PAGE>

then  such  waiver  or  consent shall be effective  only  in  the  specific
instance  and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,  however,
that  no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing  and  signed
by all the Lenders, do any of the following:  (a) amend or waive any of the
conditions   specified  in  Section  3.01,  (b)  increase  or  extend   the
Commitments  of  the  Lenders  or subject the  Lenders  to  any  additional
obligations, (c) reduce the principal of, or rate of interest specified on,
the  Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d)  postpone
any  date  fixed  for  any payment of principal of,  or  interest  on,  the
Advances  or  any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (e)  change  the
percentage  of  the  Commitments or the number of Lenders  which  shall  be
required  for  the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder,  or
(f)  amend  this  Section 8.01; and provided, further, that  no  amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative
Agent  or the Documentation Agent, as the case may be, in addition  to  the
Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties  of
such Agent under this Agreement.

by the relevant Agent.

      (b)  All payments made or funds delivered to the Administrative Agent
hereunder  shall  be  made  or  delivered to the  Administrative  Agent  as

to  account No. 12337-14219, Ref:  Apple Computer, or at such other address
as  the  Administrative Agent may designate from time to time in a  written
notice to the other parties.

      SECTION  8.03.  No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part  of  any
Lender  or  the  Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising,  any  right
hereunder  or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof;  nor  shall
any  single  or partial exercise of any such right preclude  any  other  or
further  exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies
herein  provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies  provided
by law.



                                       52
<PAGE>

SECTION  8.04.   Costs,  Expenses  and  Taxes;  Indemnification.   (a)  The
Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by  the  Agent  in  connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and
the   other  documents  to  be  delivered  hereunder,  including,   without
limitation,  the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel  for
the  Documentation Agent with respect thereto and with respect to  advising
the  Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement.  The
Borrower further agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses,
if   any  (including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  counsel  fees  and
expenses,  specifically including reasonable allocated  costs  of  in-house
counsel),  incurred  by the Agent and the Lenders in  connection  with  the
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or  otherwise)
of  this  Agreement,  the  Notes and the other documents  to  be  delivered
hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  reasonable  counsel  fees  and
expenses   in  connection  with  the  enforcement  of  rights  under   this
Section 8.04(a).  In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all stamp and
other  taxes  payable  or determined to be payable in connection  with  the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents
to  be  delivered hereunder, and agrees to save the Agent and  each  Lender
harmless  from  and  against any and all liabilities  with  respect  to  or
resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such taxes.

        (b)      If any payment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance
or  Auction  Advance  is made other than on the last day  of  the  Interest
Period for such Syndicated Advance or the applicable maturity date for such
Auction  Advance, as the case may be, as a result of a payment pursuant  to
Section  2.13 or acceleration of the maturity of the Advances  pursuant  to
Section  6.01 or for any other reason, the Borrower shall, upon  demand  by
any  Lender  (with  a  copy  of such demand  to  the  Agent),  pay  to  the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to
compensate  such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses  which
it  may  reasonably  incur as a result of such payment, including,  without
limitation,  any  loss  (including loss of anticipated  profits),  cost  or
expense  incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of  deposits
or other funds acquired by any Lender to fund or maintain such Advance.

       (c)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent
and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors,  employees, agents and advisors (each, an  "Indemnified  Party")
from  and  against  any  and  all  claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities,
obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, disbursements and
expenses  (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and  expenses  of
counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) that may be incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of  or  in
connection with or by reason of, or in connection with the preparation  for
a  defense  of,  any  investigation, litigation, proceeding  or  settlement
arising  out  of,  related to or in connection with (i) the  Advances,  the
Borrowings  or the Commitments, (ii) the use of funds advanced  under  this
Agreement, (iii) the failure of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries  to
comply fully with any and all Environmental Laws applicable to it, or  (iv)
any  acquisition  or proposed acquisition by the Borrower  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries  of all or any portion of the stock or substantially  all  the
assets of any Person (including, without limitation, the Borrower), whether
or  not  an  Indemnified Party is a party thereto and whether  or  not  the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except to the extent such
claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities, obligations,  penalties,  actions,
judgments,  suits, costs, disbursements and expenses are found in  a  final
non-appealable  judgment  by  a  court or competent  jurisdiction  to  have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified
Party.



                                       53
<PAGE>

        (d)     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the  Borrower  hereunder, the agreements and obligations  of  the  Borrower
contained  in  this  Section 8.04 shall survive  the  termination  of  this
Agreement,  the termination of the Commitments and the payment in  full  of
the Notes.

      SECTION 8.05.  Right of Set-off.  Upon (i) the occurrence and  during
the  continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request
or  the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize  the
Administrative Agent to declare the Advances and all other amounts  payable
under  this  Agreement  to  be forthwith due and payable  pursuant  to  the
provisions  of Section 6.01, each Lender is hereby authorized at  any  time
and  from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set  off
and  apply  any  and  all  deposits (general or special,  time  or  demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at  any  time
owing  by  such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the  Borrower
against  any  and all of the obligations of the Borrower now  or  hereafter
existing under this Agreement and any Note held by such Lender, whether  or
not  such  Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement  or  such
Note  and  although such obligations may be unmatured.  Each Lender  agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made
by  such  Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice  shall  not
affect  the validity of such set-off and application.  The rights  of  each
Lender under this Section 8.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such  Lender
may have.

      SECTION 8.06.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become effective
when  it  shall  have been executed by the Borrower and  the  Documentation
Agent  and  the  Documentation  Agent  shall  have  been  notified  by  the
Administrative  Agent  and  each Lender that  each  has  executed  it,  and
thereafter this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and
assigns,  except that the Borrower shall not have the right to  assign  its
rights  hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written  consent
of the Lenders.

      SECTION 8.07.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The provisions  of  this
Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit  of  the  parties
hereto  and  their  respective  successors and  assigns,  except  that  the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under  this
Agreement.

     (b)  (i)   Each Lender may assign to one or more commercial  banks  or
     Affiliates of any Lender all or a ratable portion of all of its rights
     and  obligations under this Agreement (including, without  limitation,
     all  or a ratable portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing  to
     it  and  the Notes held by it); provided, however, that (A) each  such
     assignment  shall be of a constant, and not a varying,  percentage  of
     all  rights  and  obligations under this  Agreement  (other  than  any
     Auction  Advances or Auction Notes), (B) the amount of the  Commitment
     of   the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
     assignment shall in no event be less than the lesser of $5,000,000  or
     the  remaining  Commitment  of  the assignor  Lender,  (C)  each  such
     assignment  shall be to an assignee consented to by the  Borrower  and
     the  Administrative  Agent, which consents shall not  be  unreasonably
     withheld; provided, however, that such consents shall not be  required
     with  respect to any such assignment by any Lender to an Affiliate  of
     such Lender, and (D) the parties to each such assignment shall execute
     and  deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note or Notes subject  to
     such assignment and the assigning Lender shall pay or cause to be paid
     to  the  Administrative  Agent a processing  and  recordation  fee  of
     $2,500.  From and after the effective date of any such assignment, (1)
     the Assignee thereunder shall be a

                                       54
<PAGE>

     party  hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
     have  been assigned to it pursuant to such assignment, have the rights
     and  obligations  of a Lender hereunder, and (2) the  Lender  assignor
     thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations  hereunder
     have  been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment, relinquish  its
     rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and,
     in  the case of an assignment covering all or the remaining portion of
     an  assigning  Lender's rights and obligations under  this  Agreement,
     such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

     (ii)   A  Lender may at any time grant participations to one  or  more
     banks  or  other entities in or to all or any part of its  rights  and
     obligations  under this Agreement or any Borrowings hereunder  without
     the  consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, and  to  the
     extent of any such participation (unless otherwise stated therein  and
     except  as provided below) the purchaser of such participation  shall,
     to  the  fullest  extent permitted by law, have the  same  rights  and
     benefits  hereunder and under such Borrowings as it would have  if  it
     were  such Lender hereunder; provided, however, that the Borrower  and
     the  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely
     with   the  granting  Lender  regarding  notices,  payments,   payment
     instructions and any other matters arising pursuant to this Agreement.
     Any  agreement  pursuant  to  which  any  Lender  may  grant  such   a
     participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
     sole  right  and  responsibility to enforce  the  obligations  of  the
     Borrower  hereunder,  including,  without  limitation,  the  right  to
     approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
     Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that
     such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of
     this  Agreement  described in clause (a), (b), (c) or (d)  of  Section
     8.01  without the consent of the participant.  Each Lender  agrees  to
     notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the amount of each
     participation which grants to the participant a participating interest
     in  such  Lender's Commitment to the Termination Date and the identity

U.S. $___________                            Dated:  _______, 19__



           FOR  VALUE  RECEIVED, the undersigned, APPLE COMPUTER,  INC.,  a
California  corporation (the " Borrower"), HEREBY PROMISES TO  PAY  to  the
order  of  _______________________ (the "Lender") for the  account  of  its
Applicable  Lending Office (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred  to
below)  the principal amount of each Syndicated Advance (as defined in  the
Credit Agreement) made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit
Agreement on the last day of the Interest Period (as defined in the  Credit
Agreement) for such Syndicated Advance and otherwise in accordance with the
provisions of the Credit Agreement.
           The  Borrower  promises to pay interest on the unpaid  principal
amount  of each Syndicated Advance from the date of such Syndicated Advance
until  such  principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates,  and
payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
           Both  principal and interest are payable in lawful money of  the
United  States  of  America to Bank of America National Trust  and  Savings
Association,    as    Administrative   Agent,    at    its    offices    at
_____________________________________________________________ in  same  day
funds, or at such other address or account as the Administrative Agent  may
designate  from  time to time in a written notice to  the  Borrower.   Each
Syndicated  Advance  made  by the Lender to the Borrower  pursuant  to  the
Credit  Agreement,  and all payments made on account of principal  thereof,
shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed
on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note; provided
that  the failure of the Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement
shall  not  affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or  under  the
Credit Agreement.
           This Promissory Note is one of the Syndicated Notes referred  to
in,  and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement dated  as  of
__________________, 1993 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower,  the
Lender  and certain other lenders parties thereto, and Citicorp  USA,  Inc.
and  Bank  of America National Trust and Savings Association, as Agent  for
the  Lender  and  such  other lenders.  The Credit Agreement,  among  other
things,  (i)  provides  for the making of the Syndicated  Advances  by  the
Lender  to  the  Borrower from time to time in an aggregate amount  not  to
exceed  at  any  time  outstanding  the  U.S.  dollar  amount  first  above
mentioned,  the  indebtedness  of the Borrower  resulting  from  each  such
Syndicated  Advance  being further evidenced by this Promissory  Note,  and
(ii)  contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon  the
happening  of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account  of
principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions
therein specified.
           The  Borrower  hereby waives presentment,  demand,  protest  and
notice  of  any kind.  No failure to exercise, and no delay in  exercising,
any  rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate  as  a
waiver of such rights.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results  have been included.  The results for  interim  periods
   are  not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire
   year.    These  financial  statements  and  notes  should  be  read   in
   conjunction with the Company's annual consolidated financial  statements
   and  the  notes  thereto for the fiscal year ended September  24,  1993,
   included  in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
   24, 1993 (the "1993 Form 10-K").

2. Effective September 25, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
   Accounting  Standards No. 109 -Accounting for Income Taxes  (FAS  109),
   which  changes  the  method  of accounting for  income  taxes  from  the
   deferred  method  to  the liability method.  This change  in  accounting
   principle  has  been adopted on a prospective basis, and  the  financial
   statements  of  prior  years  have not been  restated.   The  cumulative
   effect of the change was not material.

   Under  FAS  109,  deferred income taxes reflect the  future  income  tax
   effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of  assets
   and  liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their  tax  bases.
   Prior  to  1994,  the  Company  accounted for  income  taxes  under  the
   provisions  of APB Opinion No. 11, which recognized deferred  taxes  for
   the  effect  of timing differences between pretax accounting income  and
   taxable income.

   At  September  25,  1993, the significant components  of  the  Company's
   deferred tax assets and liabilities were:

   U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $211
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested  in  operations  outside of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely invested earnings, the Company provides federal  and  state
   income   taxes   currently   on  undistributed   earnings   of   foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The   Internal   Revenue  Service  has  proposed  federal   income   tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and the Company  has  made
   prepayments   thereon.    The  Company  has  contested   these   alleged
   deficiencies  and  is  pursuing administrative  and  judicial  remedies.
   Management  believes  that adequate provision  has  been  made  for  any
   adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

   3.  In  the  third  quarter of 1993, the Company  initiated  a  plan  to
   restructure  its  operations worldwide.  In connection with  this  plan,
   the  Company recorded a $321 million charge to operating expenses  ($199
   million,  or  $1.72  per share, after taxes).  The  restructuring  costs
   include  $162  million of estimated employee-related expenses  and  $159
   million   of   estimated  facilities,  equipment  and   other   expenses
   associated  with  the  consolidation,  relocation  and  termination   of
   operations and employees.

4. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options outstanding during the period.

5. Certain prior year amounts on the consolidated statements of cash  flows
   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

</TABLE>
Net  sales  for  the  first quarter of 1994 increased  by  23.4%  over  the
comparable period of 1993.  Total Macintosh(R) computer unit sales  increased
40%  in the first quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of 1993.  This
unit  sales growth principally resulted from strong sales of the  Company's
newer  product offerings within the LC, Performa(TM) and Quadra(R)  families  of
desktop  personal computers and within the PowerBook(TM) family  of  notebook-
sized  personal  computers.   This  unit growth  was  partially  offset  by
declining unit sales of certain of the Company's more established  products
and  older  product offerings.  The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh
computer unit declined 12% in the first quarter of 1994 over the comparable
period of 1993, primarily as a result of pricing actions undertaken by  the
Company  in response to continuing industrywide pricing pressures and  high
levels  of  inventory.   Going forward, the Company  anticipates  continued
industrywide competitive pricing and promotional actions.

International  net sales grew 24% and domestic net sales grew  23%  in  the
first quarter of 1994 over the comparable period of 1993.  The increase  in
international net sales primarily reflected strong net sales growth in  the
Pacific region.  Despite generally weak economic conditions and competitive
pressures  in  various  European countries, net sales  grew  moderately  in
Europe.  International net sales represented 45% of total net sales for the
first quarter of 1994, unchanged from the corresponding period of 1993.

The  Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its  first
quarter, compared with other quarters in its fiscal year, due to demand for
and  calendar  year-end buying of some of its products.  The  Company  does
not, however, consider its business to be highly seasonal.

It  is  anticipated  that  a significant portion of  the  Company's  future
revenues  will come from new products, especially personal computers  based
on  the  Power  PC  family  of  Reduced Instruction  Set  Computing  (RISC)
microprocessors.   However,  there can  be  no  assurance  that  these  new
products  will receive favorable market acceptance, and the Company  cannot
determine  the  ultimate effect these products will have on  its  sales  or
results  of  operations.  See "Factors That May Affect Future  Results  and
Financial Condition."

In general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-
needed  basis  due  to  the  Company's distribution  strategy,  which  is
designed to expedite the filling of orders.  Resellers frequently  change
delivery   schedules  and  order  rates  depending  on  changing   market
conditions.   Unfilled  orders ("backlog"),  which  are  not  necessarily
legally  binding, can be, and often are, canceled at will.  The Company's
backlog decreased to approximately $302 million at January 19, 1994, from
approximately $663 million at November 19, 1993, as the Company's  higher
inventory  levels provided greater product availability to meet  reseller
orders and delivery schedules.

                                        8
<PAGE>


In  the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any
particular  time  is not a meaningful indication of its  future  business
prospects.  Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors  affecting
the  Company's  backlog,  backlog should not  be  considered  a  reliable
indicator of the Company's future revenue or financial performance.

Gross Margin

Gross  margin  declined  both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during  the first quarter of 1994 from the comparable period of  1993.  The
decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result
of pricing and promotional actions undertaken by the Company in response to
industrywide pricing pressures (including the increasing price  competition
that the Company is experiencing in the Japanese market) and high levels of
inventory.   Gross  margin  was also adversely  affected  by  increases  in
inventory  valuation reserves associated with the high levels of inventory,
increased  costs  associated with providing customers a  wider  variety  of
product  configuration options, and a seasonal shift of product mix towards
lower margin products.

Gross margin was affected somewhat adversely by changes in foreign currency
exchange  rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative  to  certain
foreign  currencies  during the first quarter of  1994  compared  with  the
corresponding period of 1993.  The Company's operating strategy and pricing
take  into  account  changes  in exchange rates  over  time;  however,  the
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the  short
term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The  Company anticipates that gross margins will remain under pressure  and
below  historic  levels  worldwide due to a variety of  factors,  including
continued   industrywide  pricing  pressures,  increased  competition   and
compressed  product  cycles.  The Company's gross  margins  could  also  be
adversely  affected by inventory valuation reserves that  could  result  if
anticipated  unit  sales  growth projections for new  and  current  product
offerings are not realized.

</TABLE>
Research  and development expenditures decreased both in amount  and  as  a
percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 1994 when compared with the
corresponding  period of 1993.  This decrease reflects the results  of  the
Company's  restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs,  including  more
focused product development expenditures.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and development
are  critical  to  its  future  growth  and  competitive  position  in  the
marketplace  and are directly related to continued, timely  development  of
new  and enhanced products.  However, in light of the Company's expectation
of  continued  pressure  on  gross margin,  the  Company  anticipates  that
research  and  development  expenditures will decrease  in  amount  as  the
Company  maintains its efforts to manage operating expense growth  relative
to gross margin levels during 1994.

quarter of 1994 when compared with the corresponding period of 1993.   This
decrease was primarily a result of the Company's ongoing efforts to  manage
operating expense growth relative to gross margin levels, and also  due  to
an increase in the level of net sales.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses relative  to  gross  margin  levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross  margin,  and  continued  weak economic  conditions  worldwide.   The
Company's  objective  is  to  continue  to  reduce  selling,  general   and
administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales during 1994.

The  Company derived other income from sources such as interest  earned  on
cash  and portfolio balances, gains on the sale of certain venture  capital
investments,  and  gains  on  interest rate and  foreign  exchange  hedging
activities.   Interest and other income (expense), net,  decreased  in  the
first  quarter  of 1994 when compared with the same period in  1993.   This
decrease is primarily due to a non-recurring gain on the sale of certain of
the Company's venture capital investments in the first quarter of 1993,  an
increase  in  interest  expense due to higher  commercial  paper  borrowing
levels,  and a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates  and
lower cash balances.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

During the first half of calendar year 1994, the Company plans to introduce
its  first  Macintosh  computers based on a  new  PowerPC  family  of  RISC
microprocessors.   Accordingly, the Company's  results  of  operations  and
financial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  if  it  is  unable  to
successfully  transition  its  line  of Macintosh  personal  computers  and
servers  from the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors to  the  PowerPC
microprocessor.   The  success  of  this  transition  will  depend  on  the
Company's ability to continue the sales momentum of products based  on  the
Motorola  68000 series of microprocessors through the introduction  of  the
PowerPC-based  products, to successfully manage inventory  levels  of  both
product lines simultaneously, to gain market acceptance of the new PowerPC-
based  products, and to coordinate the timely development and  distribution
of  new  versions of commonly-used software products specifically  designed
for the PowerPC-based products.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected by a number of other factors, including the Company's ability  to:
increase  market share in its personal computer business while successfully
expanding  its  new  businesses and product offerings into  other  markets;
broaden   industry   acceptance  of  the  Newton  personal digital assistant 
(PDA) product, including effectively licensing Newton technology and 
marketing the related  products  and  services;  realize the  anticipated

                                       10

cost-reduction benefits  associated  with its restructuring plan initiated  
in the  third quarter of 1993; develop, manufacture, and sell its products
profitably; reduce  existing  inventory  levels; and  manage  future  
inventory  levels effectively.  The  Company's  future  operating  results 
and   financial condition may also be affected by uncertainties relative to 
global economic conditions;  the  strength of its distribution channels; 
industry  factors; and the availability and cost of components.

The  personal  computer industry is highly volatile  and  continues  to  be
characterized  by  dynamic  customer demand patterns,  rapid  technological
advances,  frequent introduction of new products and product  enhancements,
and  industrywide competition resulting in aggressive pricing practices and
downward  pressure on gross margins.  The Company's operating  results  and
financial  condition  could be adversely affected  should  the  Company  be
unable to: accurately anticipate customer demand; introduce new products on
a timely basis; manage lead times required to obtain components in order to
be  more responsive to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns; offer
customers competitive technologies while effectively managing the impact on
inventory  levels  and  the  potential for customer  confusion  created  by
product  proliferation; effectively manage the impact  on  the  Company  of
industrywide  pricing pressures; or effectively implement  and  manage  the
competitive  risk  associated with certain of the  Company's  collaboration
agreements  with other companies, such as the agreements with International
Business  Machines Corporation (IBM).  The Company's results of  operations
and  financial  condition  could also be adversely  affected  by  inventory
valuation  reserves  that  could result if anticipated  unit  sales  growth
projections for new and current product offerings are not realized.

A large portion of the Company's revenues in recent years has come from its
international operations.  As a result, the Company's operating results and
financial  condition  could  be  significantly  affected  by  international
factors,  such  as  changes  in foreign currency  exchange  rates  or  weak
economic conditions in foreign markets in which the Company distributes its
products.   The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into  account
changes  in  exchange  rates over time; however, the Company's  results  of
operations  can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

During  the first quarter of 1994, the Company introduced several  products
that extend its entry-level, midrange and notebook computer offerings.   In
addition,  the  Company  introduced  several  new  or  enhanced  peripheral
products.   The success of these new products is dependent on a  number  of
factors,  including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage  the
risks  associated  with product transitions, and the Company's  ability  to
reduce existing inventory levels and manage future inventory levels in line
with  anticipated  product  demand  and  to  manufacture  the  products  in
appropriate  quantities  to  meet  anticipated  demand.   Accordingly,  the
Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products   will
have on its sales or results of operations.

The  Company's products include certain components, such as microprocessors
manufactured  by  Motorola  Inc.  and  monochrome  active-matrix   displays
manufactured by Hosiden Corporation, that are currently available only from
single  sources.  Any availability limitations, interruptions in  supplies,
or price increases of these and other components could adversely affect the
Company's business and financial results.

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near major earthquake faults. The Company's operating results and financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

A   number  of  uncertainties  also  exist  regarding  the  marketing   and
distribution  of  the Company's products.  The Company's primary  means  of
distribution  is  through  third-party  computer  resellers   and   various
education and consumer channels.  Although the Company has in place certain
policies  to  limit concentrations of credit risk, business  and  financial
results  could  be adversely affected in the event that the generally  weak
financial   condition  of  third-party  computer  resellers  worsens.    In
addition,  the  Company is continuing its expansion into  new  distribution
channels,  such  as mass-merchandise stores (such as Sears  and  Wal-Mart),
consumer  electronics  outlets, and computer superstores,  in  response  to
changing  industry practices and customer preferences.  At this  time,  the
Company  cannot  determine the ultimate effect of  these  or  other  future
distribution expansion efforts on its future operating results.

                                       11

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments,  net of short-term borrowings  increased  to  $371
million  at  December  31, 1993 from $69 million  at  September  24,  1993.
Working  capital  increased to approximately $1.9 billion at  December  31,
1993, from $1.8 billion at September 24, 1993.

Operations  generated net cash of $367 million during the first quarter  of
1994,  compared  with $400 million used during the fourth quarter  of  1993.
This  improvement  was due primarily to decreases in inventory  levels  and
accounts  receivable.  Accounts receivable decreased by $134 million  as  a
result of improved collection activity.  Continued improvement in cash flow
from  operations for the remainder of 1994 will depend principally  on  the
Company's  ability  to  improve profit levels and the  Company's  continued
aggressive  management  of working capital, particularly  in  the  area  of
inventory management as the Company introduces its Power PC-based  personal
computers.

The  Company's inventory levels increased sequentially each quarter  during
fiscal  1993 from approximately $580 million at the end of fiscal  1992  to
approximately  $1.51 billion at the end of fiscal 1993 in  support  of  its
expanded  product  line  and distribution channels and  anticipated  higher
sales  volumes.   These higher levels of inventory, in  turn,  resulted  in
increased  levels  of short-term borrowings.  As of the end  of  the  first
quarter of fiscal 1994, inventory levels had declined by approximately $168
million  and  short-term borrowings had declined by $71  million  from  the
fiscal  1993  year-end levels, primarily as a result of improved  inventory
management  and  increased  sales resulting from  pricing  and  promotional
actions.   The Company has also identified additional measures  to  improve
management  of working capital, including the implementation  of  long-term
financing   arrangements,  and  long-term  measures  designed  to   improve
inventory   management,   such  as  increased  emphasis   on   designing-in
commonality  of  parts  among products, increased use of  manufacturing-on-
demand  based  on  products  orders  rather  than  forecasts,  and  greater
rationalization of product offerings.  Although the Company  believes  that
these  measures  will  result  in improved inventory  and  working  capital
management during 1994, there can be no assurance that these measures  will
be  successful or that inventory reserves will not be necessary  in  future
periods.

Net  cash  used  for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  totaled
approximately  $24 million during the first quarter of 1994  compared  with
$47  million  during  the fourth quarter of  1993.   These  purchases  were
primarily   of   manufacturing  machinery  and  equipment,  and   leasehold
improvements.   The Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1994
will be slightly below 1993 expenditures.

Short-term  borrowings at December 31, 1993 were approximately $71  million
lower  than  at September 24, 1993.  The Company's aggregate borrowings  at
December   31,   1993  were  approximately  $752  million,   comprised   of
approximately  $527  million  short-term  borrowings  in   the   U.S.   and
approximately  $225  million  short-term  borrowings  overseas.   Aggregate
borrowings at September 24, 1993 were $823 million.

                                       12

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term
borrowings  from  time to time to finance U.S. working  capital  needs  and
capital expenditures, because substantially all of the Company's cash, cash
equivalents,  and  short-term investments is held by foreign  subsidiaries,
generally  in  U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held  by  foreign
subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation  to
the United States; the Company's financial statements fully provide for any
related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated.

The  Company's  short-term borrowings are principally under its  commercial
paper  program.   From time to time, the Company also  borrows  to  finance
operations  pursuant to short-term uncommitted bid-line  arrangements  with
commercial  banks.  During the first quarter of 1994, the  Company  entered
into a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of
banks  to  support its commercial paper program.  No borrowings  have  been
made  under this facility.  In addition, Apple Japan, Inc., a wholly  owned
subsidiary  of the Company, incurred short-term yen-denominated  borrowings
aggregating  the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $225 million  from
several Japanese banks.

On  May  5, 1993, the Company filed an omnibus shelf registration statement
with  the Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration  of  debt
and other securities for an aggregate offering amount of $500 million.   On
January 24, 1994, the Company commenced marketing its first take-down under
this shelf registration statement in the aggregate principal amount of $300
million.  The Company believes that the shelf registration provides it with
additional financing flexibility to meet future funding requirements and to
take advantage of attractive market conditions.

In  January  1994, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company  exercised  its
option to purchase for $51.9 million the remaining partnership interest  in
the  Cupertino  Gateway Partners partnership, a general partnership,  which
owns  the  Company's  campus-type office facilities located  in  Cupertino,
California  (the  "Campus").  As a result of this purchase,  the  Company's
wholly  owned subsidiary now owns 100% of the right, title and interest  in
the  Campus. This transaction will be reflected in the Company's  financial
statements for the second quarter of 1994.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984 through 1988, which the Company is  contesting.   The
Company believes the resolution of any tax liability for these proposed tax
deficiencies  will  occur  over  the course  of  the  next  several  years.
Although  payment of any assessment is not required until the end  of  such
process,  the  Company elected to make a prepayment in April 1991  for  the
years  1984  through 1986, and a prepayment in May 1993 for the years  1987
through 1988.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future.

                                   ARTICLE II

                        AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES

           SECTION  2.01.   Syndicated  Advances.   Each  Lender  severally
agrees,  on  the  terms  and  conditions hereinafter  set  forth,  to  make
Syndicated  Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any Business  Day
during  the  period from the date hereof until the Termination Date  in  an
aggregate  amount not to exceed at any time the amount set  forth  opposite
such  Lender's  name on the signature pages hereof as such  amount  may  be
reduced  pursuant  to  Section  2.05  or  Section  8.07(b)  (such  Lender's
"Commitment"), provided that the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the
Lenders  shall  be  deemed used from time to time  to  the  extent  of  the
aggregate  amount of the Auction Advances then outstanding and such  deemed
use  of  the  aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be applied  to  the
Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments (such deemed  use
of  the  aggregate amount of the Commitments being an "Auction Reduction").
Each  Syndicated Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount  not  less  than
$25,000,000,  or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,  and
shall consist of Syndicated Advances of the same Type made on the same  day
by  the  Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments.  Within
the  limits of each Lender's Commitment, the Borrower may from time to time
borrow,  prepay  pursuant  to  Section  2.11(b)  and  reborrow  under  this
Section 2.01. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at
no  time  shall  the sum of the number of Auction Borrowings  which  remain
outstanding  plus  the  number of Interest Periods then  in  effect  exceed
fifteen (15).

          SECTION 2.02.  Making the Syndicated Advances.
(a) Each Syndicated Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than
8:00  A.M.  (San  Francisco time) on (y) the date of a proposed  Syndicated
Borrowing  comprised of Alternate Base Rate Advances,  and  (z)  the  third
Business Day prior to the date of a proposed Syndicated Borrowing comprised
of Eurodollar Rate Advances, by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent,

                                       27
<PAGE>

which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof (and in any event not
later than the same day) by facsimile, telex or cable.  Each such notice by
the Borrower of a Syndicated Borrowing (a "Notice of Syndicated Borrowing")
shall be by facsimile, telex or cable, confirmed immediately in writing, in
substantially  the  form  of  Exhibit B-1 hereto,  specifying  therein  the
(i)  requested date of such Syndicated Borrowing, which shall be a Business
Day,  (ii) requested Type of Syndicated Advances comprising such Syndicated
Borrowing,  (iii) requested aggregate amount of such Syndicated  Borrowing,
(iv)  requested Interest Period for each such Syndicated Advance,  and  (v)
the Borrower's commercial paper ratings issued by S&P and Moody's in effect
on  the  date of such request.  Each Lender shall, before 11:00  A.M.  (San
Francisco  time) on the date of such Syndicated Borrowing,  make  available
for  the  account  of  its Applicable Lending Office to the  Administrative
Agent  at  its address referred to in Section 8.02(b), in same  day  funds,
such  Lender's  ratable portion of such Syndicated  Borrowing.   After  the
Administrative  Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment  of  the
applicable  conditions set forth in Article III, the  Administrative  Agent
will  make  such  funds  available to the Borrower at  an  account  of  the
Borrower designated from time to time in writing by the Borrower and agreed
to by the Administrative Agent.

          (b)  Each Notice of Syndicated Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
binding on the Borrower.  In the case of any Syndicated Borrowing which the
related  Notice  of Syndicated Borrowing specifies is to  be  comprised  of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender  against
any  loss,  cost  or expense incurred by such Lender as  a  result  of  any
failure  to  fulfill  on or before the date specified  in  such  Notice  of
Syndicated   Borrowing  for  such  Syndicated  Borrowing   the   applicable
conditions  set  forth in Article III, including, without  limitation,  any
loss  (including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred  by
reason  of  the  liquidation or reemployment of  deposits  or  other  funds
acquired by such Lender to fund the Syndicated Advance to be made  by  such
Lender  as part of such Syndicated Borrowing when such Syndicated  Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

           (c)   Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from  a  Lender  prior  to the date of any Syndicated Borrowing  that  such
Lender  will  not make available to the Administrative Agent such  Lender's
ratable portion of such Syndicated Borrowing, the Administrative Agent  may
assume   that  such  Lender  has  made  such  portion  available   to   the
Administrative Agent on the date of such Syndicated Borrowing in accordance
with  subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, but without any obligation to do so, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If  and  to
the  extent  that  such Lender shall not have so made such ratable  portion
available  to  the  Administrative Agent,  such  Lender  and  the  Borrower
severally  agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith  on  demand
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from
the  date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount  is  repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case  of  the
Borrower,  the interest rate applicable at the time to Syndicated  Advances
comprising  such Syndicated Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such  Lender,
the  Federal  Funds Rate.  If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative
Agent  such  corresponding amount, such amount so repaid  shall  constitute
such  Lender's Syndicated Advance as part of such Syndicated Borrowing  for
purposes  of  this  Agreement, and the interest payable  thereon  shall  be
allocated  such  that  the  Administrative  Agent  shall  receive  (from  a
combination  of the sum, if any, paid to the Administrative Agent  by  such
Lender  pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence and any  interest
payment  made  by  the  Borrower)  an amount  equal  to  interest  on  such
Syndicated  Advance at the interest rate applicable thereto from  the  date
the corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent  to
the Borrower as contemplated by this Section


                                       28
<PAGE>

2.02(c)  to  and  including  the  date  such  amount  is  repaid   to   the
Administrative  Agent  by such Lender, and such Lender  shall  receive  the
balance of the interest payments made by the Borrower with respect to  such
Advance in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

           (d)  The failure of any Lender to make the Syndicated Advance to
be  made  by  it as part of any Syndicated Borrowing shall not relieve  any
other  Lender  of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its  Syndicated
Advance  on the date of such Syndicated Borrowing, but no Lender  shall  be
responsible  for  the  failure of any other Lender to make  the  Syndicated
Advance  to  be  made by such other Lender on the date  of  any  Syndicated
Borrowing.

           SECTION  2.03.   Auction Advances.  (a)  Each  Lender  severally
agrees that the Borrower may request that Auction Borrowings be made  under
this  Section 2.03 from time to time on any Business Day during the  period
from  the  date  hereof  until the date occurring  10  days  prior  to  the
Termination  Date  in the case of Absolute Rate Auction Borrowings  and  35
days prior to the Termination Date in the case of LIBOR Auction Borrowings,
in  the manner set forth below; provided that, following the making of each
Auction  Borrowing, the aggregate amount of the Advances  then  outstanding
shall  not  exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments of  the  Lenders
(computed  without  regard  to any Auction Reduction);  provided,  further,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at no time
shall  the sum of the number of Auction Borrowings which remain outstanding
plus the number of Interest Periods then in effect exceed fifteen (15).

        (i)      The  Borrower may request an Auction Borrowing under  this
     Section  2.03 by delivering to the Administrative Agent, by facsimile,
     telex  or  cable, confirmed immediately in writing,  a  notice  of  an
     Auction  Borrowing (a "Notice of Auction Borrowing"), in substantially
     the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, specifying the date (which shall be  a
     Business  Day) and aggregate amount of the proposed Auction Borrowing,
     the maturity date for repayment of each Auction Advance to be made  as
     part of such Auction Borrowing (which maturity date (x) in the case of
     Absolute  Rate  Auction Borrowings may not be earlier  than  the  date
     occurring  7  days after the date of such Auction Borrowing  or  later
     than  180  days  after  the  date of such  Auction  Borrowing  or  the
     Termination Date, whichever occurs first, or (y) in the case of  LIBOR
     Auction Borrowings shall be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months, but in no event
     shall  be  later  than  the Termination Date),  whether  the  proposed
     Auction  Borrowing is to be an Absolute Rate Auction  Borrowing  or  a
     LIBOR  Auction Borrowing, the interest payment date or dates  relating
     thereto, the Borrower's commercial paper ratings from S&P and  Moody's
     in effect on the date of such proposed Auction Borrowing and any other
     terms  to  be  applicable to such Auction Borrowing,  not  later  than
     8:00 A.M. (San Francisco time) (A) at least one Business Day prior  to
     the  date  of the proposed Auction Borrowing, in the case of  Absolute
     Rate Auction Borrowings, and (B) at least four Business Days prior  to
     the  date  of  the proposed Auction Borrowing, in the  case  of  LIBOR
     Auction  Borrowings.  The Administrative Agent shall in turn  promptly
     notify  each Lender of each request for an Auction Borrowing  received
     by  it  from the Borrower by sending such Lender a copy of the related
     Notice of Auction Borrowing.

      (ii)     Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do
     so,  irrevocably  offer to make one or more Auction  Advances  to  the
     Borrower as part of such proposed Auction Borrowing at a rate or rates
     of  interest  specified  by such Lender in  its  sole  discretion,  by
     notifying  the  Administrative Agent (which shall give  prompt  notice
     thereof to the Borrower) before 6:45 A.M. (San Francisco time) (A)  on
     the  date of such proposed Auction Borrowing, in the case of a  Notice
     of Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A) of

                                       29
<PAGE>

     paragraph  (i) above and (B) three Business Days before  the  date  of
     such  proposed Auction Borrowing, in the case of a Notice  of  Auction
     Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (i) above,  of
     the  amount of each Auction Advance which such Lender would be willing
     to make as part of such proposed Auction Borrowing (which amounts may,
     subject   to  the  first  proviso  to  the  first  sentence  of   this
     Section  2.03(a), exceed such Lender's Commitment), the rate or  rates
     of  interest therefor and such Lender's Applicable Lending Office with
     respect  to  such Auction Advance; provided that if the Administrative
     Agent in its capacity as a Lender shall, in its sole discretion, elect
     to  make  any such offer, it shall notify the Borrower of  such  offer
     before  6:15 A.M. (San Francisco time) on the date on which notice  of
     such  election is to be given to the Administrative Agent by the other
     Lenders.  Any notice of bid submitted by a Lender shall be disregarded
     if  it  (x) contains qualifying, conditional or similar language,  (y)
     proposes  terms other than or in addition to those set  forth  in  the
     applicable Notice of Auction Borrowing, or (z) arrives after the  time
     set forth in this paragraph (ii).

     (iii)      The  Borrower  shall, in turn, (A) before  8:00  A.M.  (San
     Francisco time) on the date of such proposed Auction Borrowing, in the
     case of a Notice of Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to clause (A)
     of  paragraph (i) above and (B) before 9:00 A.M. (San Francisco  time)
     three   Business  Days  before  the  date  of  such  proposed  Auction
     Borrowing,  in  the  case of a Notice of Auction  Borrowing  delivered
     pursuant to clause (B) of paragraph (i) above, either

                (x)   cancel  such  Auction Borrowing  by  giving       the
     Administrative Agent notice to that effect, or

                (y)  accept one or more of the offers made by any Lender or
          Lenders pursuant to paragraph (ii) above, in its sole discretion,
          by  giving  notice to the Administrative Agent of the  amount  of
          each  Auction Advance to be made by each Lender as part  of  such
          Auction  Borrowing,  and  reject any  remaining  offers  made  by
          Lenders   pursuant  to  paragraph  (ii)  above  by   giving   the
          Administrative  Agent  notice  to  that  effect;  provided   that
          acceptance  of offers may only be made on the basis of  ascending
          interest   rates   specified   by   the   Lenders   pursuant   to
          paragraph (ii) above.

       (iv)     If the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that such
     Auction  Borrowing is canceled pursuant to paragraph  (iii)(x)  above,
     the  Administrative  Agent shall give prompt  notice  thereof  to  the
     Lenders and such Auction Borrowing shall not be made.

        (v)      If  offers are made by two or more Lenders with  the  same
     specified  rate  of interest for a greater aggregate principal  amount
     than  the  amount  in  respect of which offers are  accepted  for  any
     Auction Borrowing, the principal amount of Auction Advances in respect
     of   which  such  offers  are  accepted  shall  be  allocated  by  the
     Administrative Agent among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in such
     multiples  of  $1,000,000  as  the  Administrative  Agent   may   deem
     appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount  of  such
     offers.  Determinations by the Administrative Agent of the amounts  of
     Auction Advances shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

       (vi)      If the Borrower accepts one or more of the offers made  by
     any  Lender  or  Lenders  pursuant to paragraph  (iii)(y)  above,  the
     Administrative  Agent shall in turn promptly notify  (A)  each  Lender
     that  has made an offer as described in paragraph (ii) above,  of  the
     date and aggregate amount of such Auction Borrowing and whether or not


                                       30
<PAGE>

     any  offer  or  offers made by such Lender pursuant to paragraph  (ii)
     above have been accepted by the Borrower, and (B) each Lender that  is
     to  make an Auction Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing, of  the
     amount  of each Auction Advance to be made by such Lender as  part  of
     such  Auction  Borrowing.  Each Lender that  is  to  make  an  Auction
     Advance as part of such Auction Borrowing shall, before 9:00 A.M. (San
     Francisco time) on the date of such Auction Borrowing specified in the
     notice  received from the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause  (A)
     of  the  preceding  sentence, make available for the  account  of  its
     Applicable  Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at its  address
     referred  to in Section 8.02(b) such Lender's portion of such  Auction
     Borrowing,  in  same day funds.  Upon satisfaction of  the  applicable
     conditions  set  forth  in  Article  III  and  after  receipt  by  the
     Administrative Agent of such funds, the Administrative Agent will make
     such  funds  available to the Borrower at an account of  the  Borrower
     designated from time to time in writing by the Borrower and agreed  to
     by  the  Administrative Agent.  Promptly after each Auction  Borrowing
     the  Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the amount of the
     Auction Borrowing, the consequent Auction Reduction and the dates upon
     which such Auction Reduction commenced and will terminate.

        (b)     Each Auction Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount  not
less  than  $25,000,000, or an integral multiple of  $1,000,000  in  excess
thereof,  and, following the making of each Auction Borrowing, the Borrower
shall  be in compliance with the limitation set forth in the first  proviso
to the first sentence of subsection (a) above.

        (c)      Within the limits and on the conditions set forth in  this
Section  2.03,  the  Borrower  may from time  to  time  borrow  under  this
Section  2.03,  repay  or  prepay pursuant to  subsection  (d)  below,  and
reborrow under this Section 2.03, provided that an Auction Borrowing  shall
not  be  made  within two Business Days of the date of  any  other  Auction
Borrowing.

       (d)     The Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the
account  of  each Lender which has made an Auction Advance, or  each  other
holder  of  an  Auction Note, on the maturity date of each Auction  Advance
(such  maturity date being that specified by the Borrower for repayment  of
such  Auction Advance in the related Notice of Auction Borrowing  delivered
pursuant  to subsection (a)(i) above), the then unpaid principal amount  of
such  Auction  Advance.  The Borrower shall have no  right  to  prepay  any
principal amount of any Auction Advance unless, and then only on the terms,
specified by the Borrower for such Auction Advance in the related Notice of
Auction  Borrowing  delivered  pursuant to  subsection  (a)(i)  above,  and
provided  that  the  Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse  each  Lender
whose  Auction Advance has been prepaid by the Borrower in respect  thereof
pursuant to Section 8.04(b).

        (e)      The  Borrower shall pay interest on the  unpaid  principal
amount of each Auction Advance from the date of such Auction Advance to the
date the principal amount of such Auction Advance is repaid in full, at the
rate  of  interest for such Auction Advance specified by the Lender  making
such  Auction Advance in its notice with respect thereto delivered pursuant
to  subsection (a)(ii) above, payable on the maturity date specified by the
Borrower  for such Auction Advance and on each other interest payment  date
or  dates specified by the Borrower for such Auction Advance in the related
Notice  of Auction Borrowing delivered pursuant to subsection (a)(i) above;
provided,  however,  that  if the maturity date  of  the  Auction  Advances
comprising an Auction Borrowing is more than three months after the date of
such  Auction Borrowing, then interest shall be payable on each  day  which
occurs  at  intervals  of  three months after  the  date  of  such  Auction
Borrowing; provided, further, that any amount of principal which

                                       31
<PAGE>

is  not  paid  when  due (whether at stated maturity,  by  acceleration  or
otherwise) shall bear interest, from the date on which such amount  is  due
until  such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per  annum
equal  at all times (i) from such due date to the applicable maturity date,
to  2% per annum above the interest rate otherwise payable with respect  to
such  Auction  Advance  hereunder, and (ii) from and after  the  applicable
maturity date, to 2% per annum above the Alternate Base Rate in effect from
time to time.

      SECTION 2.04. Fees.  (a) Facility Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a facility fee on
the  daily average amount of such Lender's Commitment (including  both  the

the  date  hereof in the case of each Lender listed on the signature  pages

Section  8.07 hereof pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender  in  the
case  of each other Lender until the Termination Date, payable on the  last

Lender's  Commitment, commencing December 31, 1993, and on the  Termination
Date,  at  the rate of (w) .08% per annum during each Level I  Period,  (x)
.10% per annum during each Level II Period, (y) .125% during each Level III
Period, and (z) .25% per annum during each Level IV Period.

      (b)   Agents'  Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay the following  fees:
(i)   to  Citicorp for Citicorp's own account a fee in respect of its  role
hereunder and in connection with the arrangement hereof in an amount and at
the  times  set  forth  in the letter agreement between  the  Borrower  and

the  right,  upon at least three Business Days' irrevocable notice  to  the
Administrative Agent, to terminate in whole or reduce ratably in  part  the
unused portions of the respective Commitments of the Lenders, provided that
the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced
to  an  amount  which is less than the aggregate principal  amount  of  the
Auction  Advances then outstanding and provided, further, that each partial
reduction  shall be in the aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or  an  integral
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

      SECTION 2.06.  Repayment of Syndicated Advances.  The Borrower  shall
repay  the principal amount of each Syndicated Advance made by each  Lender
on  the last day of the Interest Period for such Syndicated Advance or  the

      SECTION  2.07.  Interest on Syndicated Advances.  The Borrower  shall
pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Syndicated Advance made
by  each  Lender  from  the  date  of such Syndicated  Advance  until  such
principal  amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates  per  annum
and at the following times:  (a) if such Syndicated Advance is an Alternate

the date such Alternate Base Rate Advance shall be paid in full; and (b) if
such  Syndicated  Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a  rate  per  annum
equal  at all times during the Interest Period for such Syndicated  Advance
to  the  sum  of  the  Eurodollar Rate for such Interest  Period  plus  the
applicable  Eurodollar Margin, payable on the last  day  of  such  Interest
Period  and,  if such Interest Period is longer than three (3)  months,  at
intervals  of  three (3) months after the first day thereof; provided  that
any amount of principal or interest which is not paid when due (whether  at
stated  maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear  interest,  from
the  date  on which such amount is due until such amount is paid  in  full,
payable  on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per  annum
above the Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time.

      SECTION  2.08.  Notes.  The obligation of the Borrower to  repay  the
Syndicated Advances made to the Borrower by each Lender hereunder shall  be
further evidenced by a Syndicated Note in favor of such Lender in the  form
and  substance  of  Exhibit A-1 attached hereto.   The  obligation  of  the
Borrower  to repay the Auction Advances made to the Borrower by any  Lender
shall  be evidenced by an Auction Note in favor of such Lender in the  form
and substance of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto.

      SECTION  2.09.   Interest Rate Determination.  (a) The Administrative
Agent  shall  give  prompt notice to the Borrower and the  Lenders  of  the
applicable  interest  rate  determined  by  the  Administrative  Agent  for
purposes  of  Section  2.07; provided, however, that  any  failure  by  the
Administrative Agent to provide such notice shall not affect any obligation
of the Borrower or the Lenders hereunder.

        (b)      If  the Majority Lenders shall, at least one Business  Day
before  the  date  of  any  requested  Syndicated  Borrowing  comprised  of
Eurodollar  Rate  Advances,  notify  the  Administrative  Agent  that   the
Eurodollar  Rate  for Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising  such  Syndicated
Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Lenders  of
making,  funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar  Rate  Advances
for such Syndicated Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith  so
notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon the right of the Borrower to
select  Eurodollar  Rate  Advances for such  Syndicated  Borrowing  or  any
subsequent Syndicated Borrowing shall be suspended until the Administrative
Agent  shall  notify  the Borrower and the Lenders that  the  circumstances
causing  such  suspension  no  longer exist, and  each  Syndicated  Advance
comprising  such  Syndicated Borrowing shall  be  an  Alternate  Base  Rate
Advance.

      SECTION 2.10.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall  obtain
any  payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise  of  any
right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Syndicated Advances  made
by  it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12) in excess of its ratable share
of  payments  on  account of the Syndicated Advances obtained  by  all  the
Lenders,  such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders  such
participations  in  the  Syndicated Advances  made  by  them  as  shall  be
necessary  to  cause  such purchasing Lender to share  the  excess  payment
ratably with each of them, provided, however, that if all or any portion of
such  excess  payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing  Lender,
such  purchase  from each Lender shall be rescinded and such  Lender  shall
repay  to  the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent  of  such
recovery  together  with  an amount equal to such  Lender's  ratable  share
(according  to  the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's  required
repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender)
of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in
respect  of  the total amount so recovered.  The Borrower agrees  that  any
Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to

                                       33
<PAGE>

this Section 2.10 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all
its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation  as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor  of  the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

      SECTION 2.11.  Prepayments of Advances.  (a) The Borrower shall  have
no  right  to  prepay any principal amount of any Advances  other  than  as
provided in subsection (b) and subsection (c) below.

        (b)      The  Borrower  may,  upon  at  least  two  Business  Days'
irrevocable  notice, or in the case of Syndicated Borrowings  comprised  of
Alternate  Base Rate Advances notice given not later than one Business  Day
prior  to  the  proposed  date of prepayment, to the  Administrative  Agent
stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment,
and  if  such  notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay  the  outstanding
principal  amounts of the Syndicated Advances comprising part of  the  same
Syndicated  Borrowing  in whole or ratably in part, together  with  accrued
interest  to  the date of such prepayment on the principal amount  prepaid;
provided,  however,  that  (x)  each partial  prepayment  shall  be  in  an
aggregate  principal  amount  not  less than  $25,000,000  or  an  integral
multiple  of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (y) in the case of any  such
prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower shall be obligated to
reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(b).

     (c)  Except as provided in Section 2.03(d), the Borrower shall have no
right to prepay any principal amount of any Auction Advance.

     SECTION 2.12.  Increased Costs.  (a) If, after the date hereof, due to
either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by  way
of  imposition  or  increase  of  reserve  requirements,  in  the  case  of
Eurodollar   Rate  Advances,  included  in  the  Eurodollar  Rate   Reserve
Percentage)  in  or  in  the interpretation of any  law  or  regulation  or
(ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank  or
other  governmental  authority (whether or not having the  force  of  law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender (or to any commercial
bank  Affiliate  of  any non-bank Lender) of agreeing to  make  or  making,
funding  or  maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances, then the Borrower  shall
from  time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such  demand
to  the  Administrative  Agent), pay to the Administrative  Agent  for  the
account  of  such  Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate  such
Lender  or  Affiliate  for such increased cost.  A certificate  as  to  the
amount  of  such  increased  cost,  submitted  to  the  Borrower  and   the
Administrative  Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and  binding  for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

        (b)      If any Lender determines that compliance with any  law  or
regulation  or  any  guideline or request from any central  bank  or  other
governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects the
amount  of  capital  to  be maintained by such Lender  or  any  corporation
controlling  such Lender or any commercial bank Affiliate of  any  non-bank
Lender  and  that the amount of such capital is increased by or based  upon
the  existence  of  such Lender's commitment to lend  hereunder  and  other
commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy  of
such  demand  to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall  immediately
pay  to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, from  time
to  time  as  specified  by such Lender, additional amounts  sufficient  to
compensate  such Lender or such corporation or Affiliate in  the  light  of
such  circumstances,  to the extent that such Lender reasonably  determines
such  increase  in capital is allocable to the existence of  such  Lender's
commitment  to lend hereunder.  A certificate as to such amounts  submitted
to the Borrower and

                                       34
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes, absent manifest error.

      SECTION  2.13.  Illegality.  Notwithstanding any other  provision  of
this  Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative  Agent  that
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation  makes  it unlawful, or any central bank or  other  governmental
authority  asserts  that it is unlawful, for any Lender or  its  Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder, (i) the
obligation  of  the  Lenders  to make Eurodollar  Rate  Advances  shall  be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and  the
Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist  and
(ii)  the  Borrower  shall  forthwith prepay in full  all  Eurodollar  Rate
Advances  of  all Lenders then outstanding, together with interest  accrued
thereon.

     SECTION 2.14.  Payments and Computations.  (a) The Borrower shall make
each  payment hereunder and under the Notes not later than 10:00 A.M.  (San
Francisco  time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the  Administrative
Agent at its address referred to in Section 8.02(b) in same day funds.  The
Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed  like
funds  relating  to the payment of principal or interest  or  fees  ratably
(other  than  amounts  payable pursuant to Section 2.03  or  2.12)  to  the
Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and
like  funds  relating  to the payment of any other amount  payable  to  any
Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,  in
each  case  to  be applied in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement.
Upon  its  acceptance of an assignment pursuant to Section 8.07,  from  and
after  the  effective date specified in such assignment, the Administrative
Agent  shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect  of
the  interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder,  and  the
parties  to such assignment shall make all appropriate adjustments in  such
payments  for  periods  prior  to  such  effective  date  directly  between
themselves.
        (b)     All computations of interest and of fees  shall be made  by
the  Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each  case
for  the  actual number of days (including the first day but excluding  the
last  day)  occurring  in the period for which such interest  or  fees  are
payable.   Each  determination by the Administrative Agent of  an  interest
rate  or  fee  amount  hereunder shall be conclusive and  binding  for  all
purposes, absent manifest error.
        (c)     Whenever any payment hereunder and under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall  be
made  on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall
in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees,
as  the  case  may  be;  provided, however, if such extension  would  cause
payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be  made
in  the  next following calendar month, such payment shall be made  on  the
next preceding Business Day.
        (d)      Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from  the  Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is  due  to  the
Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment  in
full  to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent
may,  in  reliance  upon such assumption, cause to be distributed  to  each
Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.
If  and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such payment
in  full  to  the  Administrative Agent, each Lender  shall  repay  to  the
Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed  to  such
Lender  together  with interest thereon, for each day from  the  date  such
amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

SECTION  4.01.   Representations  and Warranties  of  the  ;Borrower.   The
Borrower represents and warrants as follows:;

   (a)The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good  standing under the laws of the State of California.  Each  Subsidiary
is  duly  organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction
in  which it is incorporated and is in good standing under the laws of such
jurisdiction except where the failure to so be in good standing (i) is  due
to a filing omission or other technical noncompliance which can be remedied
in  a  short  period  of time (and in any event within fifteen  (15)  days)
without  incurring  any  substantial cost, (ii)  is  remedied  as  soon  as
possible  and in any event within fifteen (15) days after the Borrower  has
knowledge  of  any  such failure, or (iii) such failure  will  not  have  a
material  adverse effect on the business, condition (financial  or  other),
assets, properties, operations or prospects of the Borrower or the Borrower
and  its  Subsidiaries taken as a whole.  The Borrower and each  Subsidiary
has  the corporate power to own its respective property and to carry on its
respective business as now being conducted.

Agreement  and the Notes are within the Borrower's corporate  powers,  have
been  duly  authorized  by  all  necessary corporate  action,  and  do  not
contravene  (i) the Borrower's charter or by-laws, or (ii) any  law,  rule,
regulation or contractual restriction binding on or affecting the Borrower,
or  constitute a default under any judgment, decree, order or award of  any
court  or  agency  of  government  or any  arbitrator,  or  any  indenture,
agreement or any other instrument to which the Borrower is a party, and  do
not  and will not result in the creation or imposition of any lien  on  any
asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

   (c)No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to  or
filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required  for
the  due  execution,  delivery and performance  by  the  Borrower  of  this
Agreement or the Notes.

legal,  valid  and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable  against
the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

Subsidiaries  as  at  September 25, 1992, and  the  unaudited  consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at June 25, 1993, and
the  related audited or unaudited (as the case may be) statements of income
and  stockholders'  equity  of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries  for  the
respective  fiscal periods then ended, copies of which have been  furnished
to  each Lender, fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower and
its  Subsidiaries  as  of  such respective dates and  the  results  of  the
operations  of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the periods  ended  on
such respective dates, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied.

  (f)Except as disclosed to the Documentation Agent and the Lenders in that
certain  letter  dated December 6, 1993, there is no  pending  or,  to  the
knowledge  of  the Borrower, threatened action or proceeding affecting  the
Borrower  or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental  agency
or arbitrator, which (i) is more likely than not to be adversely determined
and  such  adverse determination is reasonably likely to  have  a  material
adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the Borrower  or
any  Subsidiary,  or  (ii)  purports to affect the  legality,  validity  or
enforceability of this Agreement or any Note.

   (g)The  Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending credit  for
the  purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning  of
Regulation  U  issued  by  the Board of Governors of  the  Federal  Reserve
System),  and no proceeds of any Advance will be used to purchase or  carry
any  margin  stock  or  to  extend credit to  others  for  the  purpose  of
purchasing or carrying any margin stock.

   (h)The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has met its minimum funding
requirements  under  ERISA with respect to all of its  Plans  and  has  not
incurred any material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
under  ERISA in connection with any such Plan.  No ERISA Termination  Event
has occurred and is continuing with respect to any Plan.

   (i)The Borrower is not an "investment company" or a company "controlled"
by  an  "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment  Company
Act of 1940, as amended.

  (j)The Borrower and its Subsidiaries, to the best of their knowledge, own
or  have  obtained the right to use all patents, trademarks, service-marks,
trade  names,  copyrights, licenses and other rights, free from  burdensome
restrictions,  or  could  obtain  the same  on  terms  and  conditions  not
materially  adverse  to  the  Borrower  and  its  Subsidiaries  and   their
operations taken as a whole, that are necessary for the operation of  their
respective  businesses  as presently conducted and  for  the  operation  of
businesses described to the Lenders in writing as proposed to be conducted.

   (k)The  Borrower has and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Federal,
State  and  other tax returns which, to the best knowledge of the Borrower,
are  required  to be filed, and each has paid all taxes as  shown  on  such
returns and on all assessments received by it to the extent that such

                                       38
<PAGE>

taxes  have  become due, except such taxes as are being contested  in  good
faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have  been
established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

   (l)No  information, exhibit or report furnished by the Borrower  to  the
Agent or Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or the
Notes or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Notes contains  any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state a material fact or any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

  (m)Listed on Exhibit F attached hereto are all of the Subsidiaries of the
Borrower  as  of  the  date  of  this Agreement.  All  of  the  issued  and
outstanding  shares of the capital stock of each Subsidiary  owned  by  the
Borrower or any Subsidiary are duly issued and outstanding, fully paid  and
non-assessable and are free and clear of any lien, change or encumbrance.

   (n)In  the  ordinary  course of its business, the Borrower  conducts  an
ongoing  review  of  the  effect of Environmental  Laws  on  the  business,
operations  and  properties of the Borrower and its  Subsidiaries,  in  the
course  of  which  it identifies and evaluates associated  liabilities  and
costs (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures
required  for  clean-up  or  closure of  its  properties,  any  capital  or
operating  expenditures  required to achieve or  maintain  compliance  with
environmental protection standards imposed by law or as a condition of  any
license,   permit  or  contract,  any  related  constraints  on   operating
activities, including any periodic or permanent shutdown of any facility or
reduction  in the level of or change in the nature of operations  conducted
thereat and any actual or potential liabilities to third parties, including
employees,  and  any related costs and expenses).  On  the  basis  of  this
review,  the Borrower has reasonably concluded that Environmental Laws  are
not  likely  to  have a material adverse effect on the business,  financial
condition,  results  of  operations or prospects of  the  Borrower  or  the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries considered as a whole.

      SECTION 4.02  Representation and Warranty of the Borrower at Closing.
The Borrower represents and warrants as of the date hereof that, except  as
disclosed to the Documentation Agent and the Lenders in that certain letter
dated  December  6,  1993,  since September 25, 1992,  there  has  been  no
material  and  adverse  change in the business, operations,  properties  or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or the Borrower and  its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

to  comply,  in  all  material respects with all  applicable  laws,  rules,

any such tax, assessment, charge or claim may be contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and if

only  to  the extent, consistent with Industry Standards; and (iii)  proper
books   of  record  and  account  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles consistently applied.

material to its business, and those of each of its Subsidiaries, except  as
otherwise specifically permitted by Sections 5.02(b), 5.02(d) and  5.02(e),
and  qualify, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to qualify, to do business
in  any  jurisdiction  where the failure to do so  would  have  a  material
adverse  effect  on the business, condition (financial or  other),  assets,
properties, operations or prospects of the Borrower or the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, provided that the corporate existence of any
Subsidiary  may  be  terminated  if, in the  good  faith  judgment  of  the
Borrower, such termination is in the best interests of the Borrower and  is
not disadvantageous to the Lenders.

suffer   to  exist,  any  lien,  security  interest  or  other  charge   or
encumbrance, or any other type of preferential arrangement, upon any of its
property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except

     (A)  liens for taxes not yet due or which are being actively contested
     in good faith by appropriate proceedings,

     (B)   other  liens  incidental to the conduct of its business  or  the

     connection with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances of
     credit, and which do not in the aggregate materially detract from  the
     value  of its property or assets or materially impair the use of  such

     any  Subsidiary  after  the date hereof or any  improvements  to  real
     property  constructed by or for the account of  the  Borrower  or  any
     Subsidiary  after  the date hereof, provided that (1)  any  such  lien
     shall  be confined solely to the item or items of property so acquired
     or  constructed (and any theretofore unimproved real property on which
     such improvements are located), and (2) any such lien shall be created
     concurrently with or within twelve months following the acquisition of
     such  property  or  the  completion of  construction  of  improvements
     thereon,

     (F)   liens  existing on property including the proceeds  thereof  and
     accessions   thereto  acquired  by  the  Borrower  or  any  Subsidiary

     permitted under Section 5.02(f), does not exceed, in the aggregate, an
     amount equal to $300,000,000; provided, however, if the aggregate face
     amount  of  the notes and accounts receivable so sold does not  exceed
     $300,000,000 but such amount so sold plus the aggregate face amount of
     such  notes and accounts receivable so encumbered by liens does exceed
     $300,000,000, no Event of Default shall occur hereunder  provided  the
     Borrower simultaneously therewith makes or causes to be made effective
     provision whereby the indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement and the
     Notes will be secured by such liens

                                       43
<PAGE>

     (pursuant   to   documentation  in  form  and   substance   reasonably
     satisfactory to the Majority Lenders) equally and ratably with any and
     all  Debt  thereby  secured so long as such other  Debt  shall  be  so
     secured, and

     (I)   any  lien  renewing, extending, or refunding any lien  permitted
     under  clauses  (A) through (H), inclusive, of this  Section  5.02(a),
     provided  that the principal amount secured is not increased and  that
     such  lien  is not extended to other property (other than pursuant  to
     its original terms).

(ii)   Notwithstanding the provisions contained in subdivision (i) of  this
Section 5.02(a), in addition to the permitted liens described in clause (E)
of  Section  5.02(a)  above, the Borrower or any of  its  Subsidiaries  may
create,  assume or suffer to exist liens on any real property now owned  or
hereafter  acquired  by the Borrower or such Subsidiary  if,  after  giving
effect  thereto,  the total amount of Debt secured by such liens  permitted
pursuant  to this subdivision (ii) of this Section 5.02(a) does not  exceed
an  amount equal to $200,000,000; provided, however, if the total amount of
Debt  secured by such liens exceeds $200,000,000, no Event of Default shall
occur  hereunder  provided the Borrower simultaneously therewith  makes  or
causes to be made effective provision whereby the indebtedness evidenced by
this  Agreement  and the Notes will be secured by such liens  (pursuant  to
documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Majority
Lenders) equally and ratably with any and all other Debt thereby secured so
long as such other Debt shall be so secured.

   (b)Merger and Consolidation.  Merge into or consolidate with or  into  a
corporation,  or  permit  any Subsidiary to do  so,  except  that  (i)  any
Subsidiary  may  merge  or consolidate with any other  Subsidiary  and  any
Subsidiary may merge into the Borrower, and (ii) the Borrower may merge  or
consolidate  with any other corporation provided that (A)  either  (1)  the
Borrower  shall  be  the continuing or surviving corporation,  or  (2)  the
successor  corporation shall be a solvent corporation organized  under  the
laws  of  any State of the United States of America with a senior unsecured
long  term debt rating from S & P of at least BBB+ and from Moody's  of  at
least  Baa1, and such corporation shall expressly assume in writing all  of
the  obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and under the  Notes,
including  all  covenants  herein and therein contained,  which  assumption
shall  not  otherwise  violate any term, condition  or  provision  of  this
Agreement  or  the Notes, and such successor shall be substituted  for  the
Borrower  with the same effect as if it had been named herein  as  a  party
hereto,  and  (B)  immediately  after  giving  effect  to  such  merger  or
consolidation,  no  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred;
provided,  however,  that  no Default or Event of Default  hereunder  shall
occur  as  a  result  of  the  noncompliance by  any  Subsidiary  with  the
provisions  of  this Section 5.02(b), Section 5.02(c), Section  5.02(d)  or
Section  5.02(e)  so  long  as  (x)  the  aggregate  total  assets  of  all
Subsidiaries which have at any time failed to comply with one  or  more  of
the foregoing sections does not exceed the lesser of $200,000,000 or 4%  of
the consolidated total assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (y)
the aggregate annual gross revenues of all such Subsidiaries which have  so
failed  to comply does not exceed 5% of the consolidated gross revenues  of
the  Borrower  and  its Subsidiaries for the most recent period  of  twelve

                                       44

or  otherwise  dispose of any shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary  or
permit any Subsidiary to issue, sell or otherwise dispose of any shares  of
its capital stock or the capital stock of any other Subsidiary, except

               (i)  to the Borrower or another Subsidiary;

               (ii)  that all shares of stock and Debt of any Subsidiary at
          the  time owned by or owed to the Borrower or any Subsidiary  may
          be  sold as an entirety for a cash consideration which represents
          the  fair value (as determined in good faith by the Borrower)  at
          the  time  of  sale  of the shares of stock  and  Debt  so  sold,
          provided  that,  at the time of such sale, such Subsidiary  shall
          not  own, directly or indirectly, (a) any shares of stock or Debt
          of  any  other Subsidiary (unless all of the shares of stock  and
          Debt  of such other Subsidiary owned, directly or indirectly,  by
          the  Borrower or any Subsidiary are simultaneously being sold  as
          permitted  by  this  Section 5.02(d)), or (b)  any  Debt  of  the
          Borrower; and

                (iii)   shares of stock of any Subsidiary may be  sold  if,
          after  giving effect to such sale, such Subsidiary shall continue
          to be a Subsidiary.

   (e)Sales,  Etc.  of Assets.  Subject to the proviso to Section  5.02(b),
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or permit any Subsidiary  to
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all  of
its  assets  (in  a single transaction or series of related  transactions),
other than in the ordinary course of business, except that:

                (i)   any Subsidiary may sell, lease, transfer or otherwise
          dispose  of  any  of  its assets to the Borrower  or  to  another
          Subsidiary;

               (ii)  any Subsidiary may sell or otherwise dispose of all or
          substantially  all  of  its assets as  an  entirety  for  a  cash
          consideration  which represents the fair value (as determined  in
          good  faith by the Borrower) at the time of sale of such  assets;
          and

                 (iii)   the  Borrower  may  sell  or  dispose  of  all  or
          substantially  all  of  its  assets  to  any  other  corporation,
          provided  that  (A)  the  acquiring corporation,  following  such
          acquisition, shall be a solvent corporation organized  under  the
          laws  of any State of the United States of America with a  senior
          unsecured long term debt rating from S & P of at least  BBB+  and
          from  Moody's  of  at least Baa1, and such acquiring  corporation
          shall  expressly assume in writing all of the obligations of  the
          Borrower under this Agreement and under the Notes, including  all
          covenants  herein  and therein contained, which assumption  shall
          not  otherwise violate any term, condition or provision  of  this
          Agreement  or  the  Notes, and such acquiring  corporation  shall
          succeed  to  and be substituted for the Borrower  with  the  same
          effect  as  if  it  had  been named herein  as  a  party  hereto,
          provided,  however, that no such sale shall release the  Borrower
          from  any of its obligations and liabilities under this Agreement
          or  under  the Notes unless such sale is followed by the complete
          liquidation of the Borrower and substantially all the  assets  of
          the  Borrower  are  distributed in such liquidation  as  soon  as
          reasonably  possible (but not more than fifteen  days)  following
          such  sale, and (B) immediately after giving effect to such  sale
          or  disposition,  no  Default  or Event  of  Default  shall  have
          occurred.

   (f)Sale  of  Receivables.  Sell with recourse, or discount or  otherwise
sell for less than the face

                                       45
<PAGE>

value  thereof,  or  sell with or without recourse for consideration  other
than  cash, or permit any Subsidiary to sell with recourse, or discount  or
otherwise  sell  for  less than the face value thereof,  or  sell  with  or
without  recourse for consideration other than cash, any of  its  notes  or
accounts  receivable; provided, that the foregoing restrictions  shall  not
apply to any sale of notes or accounts receivable if, on and as of the date
of  such sale and after giving effect thereto, the aggregate face amount of
all  the  notes or accounts receivable so sold after the date hereof,  plus
the face amount of notes and accounts receivable subject to liens permitted
pursuant to clause (H) of Section 5.02(a)(i) as of such date of sale,  does
not exceed $300,000,000; provided, however, if the aggregate face amount of
the notes and accounts receivable so sold does not exceed $300,000,000, but
such  amount  so  sold plus the aggregate face amount  of  such  notes  and
accounts  receivable  so encumbered by liens does exceed  $300,000,000,  no
Event of Default shall occur hereunder provided the Borrower simultaneously
therewith  makes  or  causes  to be made effective  provision  whereby  the
indebtedness evidenced by this Agreement and the Notes will be  secured  by
such  liens  (pursuant  to documentation in form and  substance  reasonably
satisfactory to the Majority Lenders) equally and ratably with any and  all
Debt  thereby  secured  so long as such other Debt  shall  be  so  secured.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing provisions of  this  Section  5.02(f),  but
without limiting the provisions of Section 5.02(a)(i)(H), the Borrower  and
the Subsidiaries may sell its notes or accounts receivable at a discount on
a  non-recourse basis to reflect the fair present value thereof, so long as
such discount shall be at a rate not in excess of the Alternate Base Rate.

   (b)any representation or warranty made by the Borrower herein or by  the
Borrower  in  connection  with this Agreement  shall  prove  to  have  been
incorrect in any material respect when made; or
   (c)the  Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any term, covenant  or
agreement contained in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) or Section  5.02;

   (d)the  Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any term, covenant  or

shall remain unremedied for 30 days after written notice thereof shall have
been given to the Borrower by the Agent or any Lender; or

   (e)(i)  the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail  to  pay  any

$10,000,000  ("Material  Debt")  in  the  aggregate  (but  excluding   Debt
outstanding  hereunder), when the same becomes due and payable (whether  by
scheduled   maturity,   required  prepayment,   acceleration,   demand   or
otherwise), and such failure shall

                                       46

continue  after  the  applicable grace period, if  any,  specified  in  the
agreement or instrument relating to such Material Debt; or any other  event
shall  occur  or  condition shall exist under any agreement  or  instrument
relating  to any such Material Debt and shall continue after the applicable
grace  period, if any, specified in such agreement or instrument; but  only
if  the  effect of such failure to pay, event or condition is to accelerate
the  maturity  of such Material Debt; or any such Material  Debt  shall  be
declared  by the creditor to be due and payable, or required to be  prepaid
(other  than  by  a  regularly  scheduled required  prepayment),  redeemed,
purchased  or defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or  defease
such Material Debt shall be required to be made, in each case prior to  the
stated  maturity thereof; or (ii) any event shall occur or condition  shall
exist  under  any  agreement or instrument relating  to  any  Debt  of  the
Borrower  or any of its Subsidiaries outstanding in a principal  amount  in
excess  of  $50,000,000  in  the aggregate and  shall  continue  after  the
applicable grace period, if any, specified in such agreement or instrument,
if  the effect of such event or condition is to permit the acceleration  by
the creditor of, the maturity of such Debt; or

   (f)the  Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall generally not pay  its
debts as such debts become due, or shall admit in writing its inability  to
pay its debts generally, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit
of  creditors;  or  any proceeding shall be instituted by  or  against  the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries seeking to adjudicate it as bankrupt or
insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its debts under any
law  relating  to  bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization  or  relief  of
debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the appointment  of
a  receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for any
substantial  part of its property and, in the case of any  such  proceeding
instituted  against it (but not instituted by it), either  such  proceeding
shall  remain  undismissed  or  unstayed  for  a  period  of  thirty   (30)
consecutive  days,  or  any  of  the  actions  sought  in  such  proceeding
(including,  without limitation, the entry of an order for relief  against,
or  the  appointment  of a receiver, trustee, custodian  or  other  similar
official for, it or for any substantial part of its property) shall  occur;
or  the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall take any corporate action
to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this subsection (f); or

   (g)any  order, judgment or decree is entered in any proceedings  against
the Borrower or any Subsidiary decreeing the dissolution of the Borrower or
such Subsidiary; or

   (h)a final judgment or order for the payment of money in an amount which
exceeds  $10,000,000 shall be rendered against the Borrower or any  of  its
Subsidiaries  and  either  (i)  enforcement  proceedings  shall  have  been
commenced  by any creditor upon such judgment, or (ii) there shall  be  any
period  of  thirty (30) consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement
of  such  judgment  or order, by reason of a pending appeal  or  otherwise,
shall not be in effect; or

   (i)any ERISA Termination Event that the Lenders determine in good  faith
might  constitute  grounds for the termination  of  any  Plan  or  for  the
appointment by the appropriate United States district court of a trustee to
administer any Plan shall have occurred and be continuing thirty (30)  days
after  written notice to such effect shall have been given to the  Borrower
by  the  Agent,  or  any Plan shall be terminated, or a  trustee  shall  be
appointed by an appropriate United States district court to administer  any
Plan,   or   the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation  shall  institute

then,  and  in  any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall  at  the
request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to the
Borrower,  declare  the obligation of each Lender to make  Advances  to  be
terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall at
the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, by notice to
the  Borrower,  declare the Advances, all interest thereon  and  all  other
amounts  payable  under  this Agreement to be forthwith  due  and  payable,
whereupon the Advances, all such interest and all such amounts shall become
and  be forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest  or
further notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrower;  provided,  however, that if an Event  of  Default  specified  in
Section  6.01(f) shall occur, then, (A) the obligation of  each  Lender  to
make Advances shall automatically be terminated, and (B) the Advances,  all
such  interest and all such amounts shall automatically become and  be  due
and  payable,  without presentment, demand, protest or any  notice  of  any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    THE AGENT

      SECTION 7.01.  Authorization and Action.  Each Lender hereby appoints
and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and  to
exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent  by
the  terms  hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably  incidental
thereto.  As  to  any matters not expressly provided for by this  Agreement
(including,  without limitation, enforcement or collection of  the  amounts
payable hereunder and under the Notes), the Agent shall not be required  to
exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or
to  refrain  from  acting (and shall be fully protected  in  so  acting  or
refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority Lenders,  and
such  instructions  shall be binding upon all Lenders and  all  holders  of
Notes; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take  any
action  which exposes the Agent to personal liability or which is  contrary
to  this  Agreement or applicable law.  The Agent agrees to  give  to  each
Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrower pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.02.  Delegation of Duties.  The Agent may execute any of its
duties under this Agreement by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-
fact  and  shall  be entitled to advice of counsel concerning  all  matters
pertaining  to  such  duties.  The Agent shall not be responsible  for  the
negligence  or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it  selects
with reasonable care.

      SECTION 7.03.  Agent's Reliance, Etc.  Neither the Agent nor  any  of
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement,  except  for  its  or  their own  gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct.   Without limitation of the generality of  the  foregoing,  the
Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until  the
Agent  receives and accepts an assignment entered into by the Lender  which
is  the  payee of such Note, as assignor, and an assignee, as  provided  in
Section  8.07; (ii) may consult with legal counsel (including  counsel  for
the Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by
it  and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken  in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or  experts;  (iii) makes no warranty or representation to any  Lender  and
shall  not  be responsible to any Lender for any statements, warranties  or
representations  (whether written or oral) made in or  in  connection  with
this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any

                                       48
<PAGE>

duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of  any
of  the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the
Borrower  or  to inspect the property (including the books and records)  of
the  Borrower;  (v)  shall not be responsible to any  Lender  for  the  due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency  or
value  of  this  Agreement or any other instrument  or  document  furnished
pursuant  hereto; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect  of
this  Agreement  by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate  or  other
instrument  or  writing  (which may be by telecopier,  telegram,  cable  or
telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper  party
or parties.

      SECTION  7.04.  Notice of Default.  Neither Agent shall be deemed  to
have  knowledge  or  notice of the occurrence of any Default  or  Event  of
Default,  except  with  respect to defaults in the  payment  of  principal,
interest  and  fees  required to be paid to such Agent, unless  such  Agent
shall  have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to  this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating
that  such notice is a "notice of default".  In the event that either Agent
receives  such notice, such Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders.
The  Administrative  Agent  shall take such action  with  respect  to  such
Default  or Event of Default as shall be requested by the Majority  Lenders
in  accordance with Section 6.01; provided, however, that unless and  until
the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  received  any  such  request,  the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such  action,
or  refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or  Event
of  Default  as  it  shall deem advisable or in the best  interest  of  the
Lenders (but not including the actions reserved for the Majority Lenders in
said Section 6.01).

      SECTION 7.05.  Lender Credit Decision.  Each Lender acknowledges that
it  has,  independently and without reliance upon the Agent  or  any  other
Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01(e)
and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its  own  credit  analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each
Lender  also acknowledges that it will, independently and without  reliance
upon  the  Agent  or  any  other Lender and based  on  such  documents  and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make  its
own  credit  decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.
Except  for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein  required
to  be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have  any
duty  or  responsibility to provide any Lender with  any  credit  or  other
information  concerning  the  business,  prospects,  operations,  property,
financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may
come into the possession of the Agent.

      SECTION 7.06.  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify  each
Agent  and  their  respective Affiliates, officers,  directors,  employees,
agents  and  attorneys-in-fact ("Indemnified Persons") (to the  extent  not
reimbursed by the Borrower), ratably according to the respective  principal
amounts  outstanding under the Syndicated Notes then held by each  of  them
(or  if  no  Syndicated  Advances are at the time  outstanding  or  if  any
Syndicated  Notes  are  held  by Persons which  are  not  Lenders,  ratably
according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against
any  and  all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind  or
nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
the  Indemnified Persons or any of them  in any way relating to or  arising
out  of  this  Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the  Indemnified
Persons or any of them under this Agreement, provided that no Lender  shall
be liable for any portion of such claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages,   penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,   expenses   or
disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct  of
an  Indemnified Person.  Without limitation of the foregoing,  each  Lender
agrees to

                                       49
<PAGE>

reimburse  the  Agent  promptly upon demand for its ratable  share  of  any
reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees)  and  allocated
costs  of  internal  counsel incurred by the Agent in connection  with  the
preparation,  execution, delivery, administration, modification,  amendment
or   enforcement  (whether  through  negotiations,  legal  proceedings   or
otherwise)  of,  or  legal advice in respect of rights or  responsibilities
under,  this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed  for
such expenses by the Borrower.

      SECTION  7.07.  Agent in Individual Capacity.  BofA and Citicorp  and
their respective Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit  for
the  account  of,  accept deposits from, acquire equity interests  in,  and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other
business  with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as  though
BofA  and  Citicorp respectively were not the Agent hereunder, and  without
notice  to  or  consent of the Lenders.  With respect to  their  respective
Advances,  BofA  and Citicorp shall have the same rights and  powers  under
this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though they
were not the Agent.

      SECTION 7.08.  Successor Agent.  The Agent may, and at the request of
the  Majority Lenders shall, resign as Agent at any time by giving  written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation,
the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent.  If
no  successor  Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority  Lenders,
and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the
retiring  Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring  Agent
may,  on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be  a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or
of  any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$300,000,000  or  an  Affiliate  thereof.   Upon  the  acceptance  of   any
appointment  as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor  Agent
shall  thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,
privileges  and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent  shall
be  discharged  from  its  duties  and  obligations  as  Agent  under  this
Agreement.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent,  the
provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.09.  The Agent.  Neither Agent shall be liable for any cost,
expense  (including,  without limitation, counsel fees and  disbursements),
claim, demand, action, loss or liability that the other Agent may suffer or
incur  in connection with this Agreement or any action taken or omitted  by
such  other Agent hereunder; provided, however, that the provisions of this
Section  7.09  shall  not affect the obligation of each Lender  (including,
without  limitation, each Agent in its capacity as a Lender  hereunder)  to
indemnify each Agent pursuant to Section 7.06 hereof.

     SECTION 7.10.  Withholding Tax.

        (a)      If  any  Lender is a "foreign corporation, partnership  or
trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Lender claims exemption from
United States withholding tax under Section 1441 or 1442 of the Code,  such
Lender agrees with and in favor of the Administrative Agent, to deliver  to
the Administrative Agent:  (i) if such Lender claims an exemption from,  or
a  reduction of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly
completed IRS Forms 1001 and W-8 before the payment of any interest in  the
first  calendar year and before the payment of any interest in  each  third
succeeding  calendar  year during which interest may  be  paid  under  this
Agreement; (ii) if such Lender claims that interest paid under

                                       50
<PAGE>

this  Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it  is
effectively  connected  with a United States  trade  or  business  of  such
Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224  before
the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of such Lender
and  in  each succeeding taxable year of such Lender during which  interest
may  be  paid under this Agreement, and IRS Form W-9; and (iii) such  other
form or forms as may be required under the Code or other laws of the United
States  as  a  condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United  States
withholding  tax.  Such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Administrative
Agent  of any change in circumstances which would modify or render  invalid
any  claimed exemption or reduction.  In addition in the event  any  Lender
claims  exemption  from, or reduction of, withholding tax  under  a  United
States  tax  treaty  by  providing IRS Form 1001  and  such  Lender  sells,
assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or  part  of
the  obligations of the Borrower to such Lender under this Agreement,  such
Lender  agrees to notify the Administrative Agent of the percentage  amount
in  which  it  is  no  longer the beneficial owner of  obligations  of  the
Borrower  to  such  Lender under this Agreement.  To  the  extent  of  such
percentage  amount, the Administrative Agent will treat such  Lender's  IRS
Form  1001  as no longer valid.  In the event any Lender claiming exemption
from  United  States  withholding tax by filing  IRS  Form  4224  with  the
Administrative  Agent  sells,  assigns,  grants  a  participation  in,   or
otherwise transfers all or part of the obligations of the Borrower to  such
Lender  under  this  Agreement,  such  Lender  agrees  to  undertake   sole
responsibility for complying with the withholding tax requirements  imposed
by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

        (b)      If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding  tax, the Administrative Agent may withhold from  any  interest
payment  to  such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding
tax  after  taking  into account such reduction.  If  the  forms  or  other
documentation  required  by  subsection  (a)  are  not  delivered  to   the
Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent may withhold  from  any
interest  payment  to  such  Lender  not  providing  such  forms  or  other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

       (c)     If the IRS or any other governmental authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Administrative  Agent
did  not  properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account  of
any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered was not properly
executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative  Agent
of  a  change  in  circumstances  which rendered  the  exemption  from,  or
reduction  of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other  reason)  such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly  or  indirectly by the Administrative Agent as tax  or  otherwise,
including  penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed  by  any
jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under  this
Section  7.10,  together with all costs and expenses (including  attorney's
fees  and  costs).  The obligation of the Lenders in this subsection  shall
survive  the  payment of all obligations hereunder and the  resignation  or
replacement of the Administrative Agent.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      SECTION  8.01.   Amendments,  Etc.  No amendment  or  waiver  of  any
provision  of this Agreement or the Notes, nor consent to any departure  by
the  Borrower  therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless  the  same
shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Lenders, and

                                       51
<PAGE>

then  such  waiver  or  consent shall be effective  only  in  the  specific
instance  and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,  however,
that  no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing  and  signed
by all the Lenders, do any of the following:  (a) amend or waive any of the
conditions   specified  in  Section  3.01,  (b)  increase  or  extend   the
Commitments  of  the  Lenders  or subject the  Lenders  to  any  additional
obligations, (c) reduce the principal of, or rate of interest specified on,
the  Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d)  postpone
any  date  fixed  for  any payment of principal of,  or  interest  on,  the
Advances  or  any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (e)  change  the
percentage  of  the  Commitments or the number of Lenders  which  shall  be
required  for  the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder,  or
(f)  amend  this  Section 8.01; and provided, further, that  no  amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Administrative
Agent  or the Documentation Agent, as the case may be, in addition  to  the
Lenders required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties  of
such Agent under this Agreement.

as  the  Administrative Agent may designate from time to time in a  written
notice to the other parties.

      SECTION  8.03.  No Waiver; Remedies.  No failure on the part  of  any
Lender  or  the  Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising,  any  right
hereunder  or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof;  nor  shall
any  single  or partial exercise of any such right preclude  any  other  or
further  exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.  The remedies
herein  provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies  provided
by law.



                                       52
<PAGE>

SECTION  8.04.   Costs,  Expenses  and  Taxes;  Indemnification.   (a)  The
Borrower agrees to pay on demand all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by  the  Agent  in  connection with the preparation,  execution,  delivery,
administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Notes and
the   other  documents  to  be  delivered  hereunder,  including,   without

expenses,  specifically including reasonable allocated  costs  of  in-house
counsel),  incurred  by the Agent and the Lenders in  connection  with  the
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or  otherwise)

hereunder,  including,  without limitation,  reasonable  counsel  fees  and
expenses   in  connection  with  the  enforcement  of  rights  under   this

other  taxes  payable  or determined to be payable in connection  with  the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the other documents
to  be  delivered hereunder, and agrees to save the Agent and  each  Lender
harmless  from  and  against any and all liabilities  with  respect  to  or

        (b)      If any payment of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Advance
or  Auction  Advance  is made other than on the last day  of  the  Interest
Period for such Syndicated Advance or the applicable maturity date for such
Auction  Advance, as the case may be, as a result of a payment pursuant  to
Section  2.13 or acceleration of the maturity of the Advances  pursuant  to
Section  6.01 or for any other reason, the Borrower shall, upon  demand  by
any  Lender  (with  a  copy  of such demand  to  the  Agent),  pay  to  the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender any amounts required to
compensate  such Lender for any additional losses, costs or expenses  which
it  may  reasonably  incur as a result of such payment, including,  without
limitation,  any  loss  (including loss of anticipated  profits),  cost  or

       (c)     The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent
and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers,

arising  out  of,  related to or in connection with (i) the  Advances,  the
Borrowings  or the Commitments, (ii) the use of funds advanced  under  this
Agreement, (iii) the failure of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries  to

Subsidiaries  of all or any portion of the stock or substantially  all  the
assets of any Person (including, without limitation, the Borrower), whether
or  not  an  Indemnified Party is a party thereto and whether  or  not  the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, except to the extent such
claims,  damages,  losses,  liabilities, obligations,  penalties,  actions,

        (d)     Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of
the  Borrower  hereunder, the agreements and obligations  of  the  Borrower
contained  in  this  Section 8.04 shall survive  the  termination  of  this
Agreement,  the termination of the Commitments and the payment in  full  of
the Notes.

      SECTION 8.05.  Right of Set-off.  Upon (i) the occurrence and  during
the  continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request
or  the granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize  the
Administrative Agent to declare the Advances and all other amounts  payable
under  this  Agreement  to  be forthwith due and payable  pursuant  to  the
provisions  of Section 6.01, each Lender is hereby authorized at  any  time
and  from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set  off
and  apply  any  and  all  deposits (general or special,  time  or  demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at  any  time
owing  by  such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the  Borrower
against  any  and all of the obligations of the Borrower now  or  hereafter
existing under this Agreement and any Note held by such Lender, whether  or
not  such  Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement  or  such
Note  and  although such obligations may be unmatured.  Each Lender  agrees
promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application made
by  such  Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice  shall  not
affect  the validity of such set-off and application.  The rights  of  each
Lender under this Section 8.05 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which such  Lender
may have.

      SECTION 8.06.  Binding Effect.  This Agreement shall become effective
when  it  shall  have been executed by the Borrower and  the  Documentation
Agent  and  the  Documentation  Agent  shall  have  been  notified  by  the
Administrative  Agent  and  each Lender that  each  has  executed  it,  and
thereafter this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the Borrower, the Agent and each Lender and their respective successors and
assigns,  except that the Borrower shall not have the right to  assign  its
rights  hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written  consent
of the Lenders.

      SECTION 8.07.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The provisions  of  this
Agreement  shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit  of  the  parties
hereto  and  their  respective  successors and  assigns,  except  that  the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights under  this
Agreement.

     (b)  (i)   Each Lender may assign to one or more commercial  banks  or
     Affiliates of any Lender all or a ratable portion of all of its rights
     and  obligations under this Agreement (including, without  limitation,
     all  or a ratable portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing  to
     it  and  the Notes held by it); provided, however, that (A) each  such
     assignment  shall be of a constant, and not a varying,  percentage  of
     all  rights  and  obligations under this  Agreement  (other  than  any
     Auction  Advances or Auction Notes), (B) the amount of the  Commitment
     of   the  assigning  Lender  being  assigned  pursuant  to  each  such
     assignment shall in no event be less than the lesser of $5,000,000  or
     the  remaining  Commitment  of  the assignor  Lender,  (C)  each  such
     assignment  shall be to an assignee consented to by the  Borrower  and
     the  Administrative  Agent, which consents shall not  be  unreasonably
     withheld; provided, however, that such consents shall not be  required
     with  respect to any such assignment by any Lender to an Affiliate  of
     such Lender, and (D) the parties to each such assignment shall execute
     and  deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note or Notes subject  to
     such assignment and the assigning Lender shall pay or cause to be paid
     to  the  Administrative  Agent a processing  and  recordation  fee  of
     $2,500.  From and after the effective date of any such assignment, (1)
     the Assignee thereunder shall be a

                                       54
<PAGE>

     party  hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
     have  been assigned to it pursuant to such assignment, have the rights
     and  obligations  of a Lender hereunder, and (2) the  Lender  assignor
     thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations  hereunder
     have  been assigned by it pursuant to such assignment, relinquish  its
     rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and,
     in  the case of an assignment covering all or the remaining portion of
     an  assigning  Lender's rights and obligations under  this  Agreement,
     such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

     (ii)   A  Lender may at any time grant participations to one  or  more
     banks  or  other entities in or to all or any part of its  rights  and
     obligations  under this Agreement or any Borrowings hereunder  without
     the  consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, and  to  the
     extent of any such participation (unless otherwise stated therein  and
     except  as provided below) the purchaser of such participation  shall,
     to  the  fullest  extent permitted by law, have the  same  rights  and
     benefits  hereunder and under such Borrowings as it would have  if  it
     were  such Lender hereunder; provided, however, that the Borrower  and
     the  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely
     with   the  granting  Lender  regarding  notices,  payments,   payment
     instructions and any other matters arising pursuant to this Agreement.
     Any  agreement  pursuant  to  which  any  Lender  may  grant  such   a
     participating interest shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
     sole  right  and  responsibility to enforce  the  obligations  of  the
     Borrower  hereunder,  including,  without  limitation,  the  right  to
     approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
     Agreement; provided that such participation agreement may provide that
     such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of
     this  Agreement  described in clause (a), (b), (c) or (d)  of  Section
     8.01  without the consent of the participant.  Each Lender  agrees  to
     notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the amount of each
     participation which grants to the participant a participating interest
     in  such  Lender's Commitment to the Termination Date and the identity
     of each such participant.

        (c)      The  Administrative Agent and the Borrower  may,  for  all
purposes  of  this Agreement, treat any Lender as the holder  of  any  Note
drawn to its order (and owner of the Loans evidenced thereby) until written
notice  of  assignment,  participation or other transfer  shall  have  been
received by them.

        (d)      If  any Eurodollar Reference Bank or its Lender  Affiliate
assigns its Notes to an unaffiliated institution, the Administrative  Agent
shall,  in  consultation  with the Borrower and with  the  consent  of  the
Majority  Lenders,  appoint another bank to act as a  Eurodollar  Reference
Bank hereunder, and pending such appointment, the Eurodollar Rate shall  be
determined on the basis of the remaining Eurodollar Reference Bank(s).

      (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion
of  its  rights  under this Agreement (including, without  limitation,  the
Advances  owing  to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in  favor  of  any
Federal  Reserve  Bank in accordance with Regulation  A  of  the  Board  of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

      SECTION  8.08.  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED  BY,
AND  CONSTRUED  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE  STATE  OF  CALIFORNIA
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CHOICE OF LAW RULES OF THAT STATE.

      SECTION 8.11.  Confidentiality.  In accordance with normal procedures
regarding  proprietary  information supplied  by  customers,  each  of  the
Lenders agrees to keep confidential, and to cause its employees, agents and
representatives to keep confidential, information relating to the  Borrower
or  any  Subsidiary received pursuant to or in connection with this  Credit
Agreement  and  the  transactions contemplated  hereby  and  identified  as

information  (i)  upon  the  order of any court or  administrative  agency,
(ii)  upon  the  request or demand of any regulatory  agency  or  authority
having  jurisdiction over the Agent or such Lender, (iii)  which  has  been
publicly  disclosed, (iv) which has been lawfully obtained by any Agent  or
any of the Lenders from a Person other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
the Agent or any other Lender, or (v) to any participant in or assignee of,
or prospective participant in or assignee of, all or any part of the rights
and  obligations of such Agent or such Lender under this Agreement  or  any
Advances  hereunder  or  to any independent auditor or  other  professional
advisor  of  the  Agent or such Lender (provided that such  participant  or
assignee,  or  prospective  participant or assignee,  or  such  auditor  or
professional  advisor  agrees  to  comply  with  the  same  confidentiality
requirements   as  set  forth  in  this  Section  8.11,   or   such   other
confidentiality  requirements  as  shall  be  reasonably  approved  by  the
Borrower).   If  the  Agent or any Lender shall disclose  such  information
pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, such Agent
or  Lender  shall  endeavor  to give the Borrower  prompt  notice  of  such
disclosure, but it is expressly agreed and understood that they  shall  not
be liable for failing to do so.

      SECTION  8.12.   Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH  OF  THE  BORROWER,  THE
LENDERS AND THE AGENT, TO THE EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY DO SO, HEREBY EXPRESSLY
WAIVES  ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,  CAUSE  OF
ACTION  OR  PROCEEDINGS ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
THE  NOTES OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN EACH CASE
WHETHER  NOW  EXISTING  OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND IRRESPECTIVE  OF  WHETHER
SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.  EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE LENDERS
AND  THE AGENT, TO THE EXTENT IT MAY LEGALLY DO SO, HEREBY AGREES THAT  ANY
SUCH  CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE DECIDED
BY  A  COURT  TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT ANY PARTY HERETO  MAY  FILE  AN
ORIGINAL  COUNTERPART  OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 8.12  WITH  ANY  COURT  AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER PARTIES TO WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY.

      SECTION  8.13.   Entire  Agreement.  This Agreement,  and  the  other
documents,  instruments  and agreements referred  to  herein  or  otherwise
executed by the parties pursuant hereto or in connection herewith set forth
the  entire  understanding among the Borrower, the Lenders and  the  Agent.
Any   and   all   previous  representations,  warranties,  agreements   and
understandings between or among the parties regarding the subject matter of
this Agreement, whether written or oral, are superseded by this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.14.  Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited  or  unenforceable  in  any  jurisdiction  shall,  as  to   such
jurisdiction,  be  ineffective  to  the  extent  of  such  prohibition   or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof,  and
any  such  prohibition  or unenforceability in any jurisdiction  shall  not
invalidate   or   render  unenforceable  such  provision   in   any   other
jurisdiction.

U.S. $___________                            Dated:  _______, 19__



           FOR  VALUE  RECEIVED, the undersigned, APPLE COMPUTER,  INC.,  a
California  corporation (the " Borrower"), HEREBY PROMISES TO  PAY  to  the
order  of  _______________________ (the "Lender") for the  account  of  its
Applicable  Lending Office (as defined in the Credit Agreement referred  to
below)  the principal amount of each Syndicated Advance (as defined in  the
Credit Agreement) made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Credit
Agreement on the last day of the Interest Period (as defined in the  Credit
Agreement) for such Syndicated Advance and otherwise in accordance with the
provisions of the Credit Agreement.
           The  Borrower  promises to pay interest on the unpaid  principal
amount  of each Syndicated Advance from the date of such Syndicated Advance
until  such  principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates,  and
payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.
           Both  principal and interest are payable in lawful money of  the
United  States  of  America to Bank of America National Trust  and  Savings
Association,    as    Administrative   Agent,    at    its    offices    at
_____________________________________________________________ in  same  day
funds, or at such other address or account as the Administrative Agent  may
designate  from  time to time in a written notice to  the  Borrower.   Each
Syndicated  Advance  made  by the Lender to the Borrower  pursuant  to  the
Credit  Agreement,  and all payments made on account of principal  thereof,
shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed
on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note; provided
that  the failure of the Lender to make any such recordation or endorsement
shall  not  affect the obligations of the Borrower hereunder or  under  the
Credit Agreement.
           This Promissory Note is one of the Syndicated Notes referred  to
in,  and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement dated  as  of
__________________, 1993 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower,  the
Lender  and certain other lenders parties thereto, and Citicorp  USA,  Inc.

the  Lender  and  such  other lenders.  The Credit Agreement,  among  other
things,  (i)  provides  for the making of the Syndicated  Advances  by  the
Lender  to  the  Borrower from time to time in an aggregate amount  not  to
exceed  at  any  time  outstanding  the  U.S.  dollar  amount  first  above
mentioned,  the  indebtedness  of the Borrower  resulting  from  each  such
Syndicated  Advance  being further evidenced by this Promissory  Note,  and
(ii)  contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon  the
happening  of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account  of
principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions
therein specified.
           The  Borrower  hereby waives presentment,  demand,  protest  and
notice  of  any kind.  No failure to exercise, and no delay in  exercising,
any  rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate  as  a
waiver of such rights.
