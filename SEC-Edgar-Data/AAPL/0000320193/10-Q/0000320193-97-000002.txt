APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited)

1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the 
Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair 
statement of interim results have been included. All adjustments 
are of a normal recurring nature unless specified in a separate 
note included in these Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These 
financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with 
the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the 
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 27, 1996, 
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
September 27, 1996 (the "1996 Form 10-K").

2.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began 
to implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and 
restoring profitability to the Company's operations. The 
restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for 
Company products and the Company's adoption of a new 
strategic direction. The restructuring actions under this plan that 
the Company has taken and intends to take consist primarily of 
terminating approximately 1,500 full-time employees (down 
from an initial planned termination of approximately 2,800), 
approximately 900 of whom have been terminated from plan 
inception through December 27, 1996, excluding employees who 
were hired by SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the 
purchasers of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing 
facility and the Napa, California data center facility, respectively;
canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of these 
employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and 
outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling 
contracts as a result of terminating eWorld(trademark), Apple's 
on-line service. These actions resulted in an initial charge of 
$207 million. The charge was adjusted downward by $28 million 
in the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily as a result of greater than 
expected voluntary terminations, which led to fewer than planned 
involuntary terminations, as well as lower than expected costs to 
cancel or vacate certain facility leases, partially offset by greater 
than expected costs to cancel certain contracts and to write down 
certain operating assets sold or to be sold.  The restructuring 
actions have resulted in cash expenditures of $66 million and 
noncash asset write-downs of $8 million from plan inception 
through December 27, 1996. The Company expects that the 
remaining $105 million accrued balance at December 27, 1996, 
will result in cash expenditures of approximately $50 million 
over the next twelve months and approximately $9 million 
thereafter. The Company expects that most of the contemplated 
restructuring actions related to the plan implemented in the 
second quarter of 1996 will be completed within the next six 
months and will be financed through current working capital and 
continued short-term borrowings.

	The Company recently announced that supplemental 
restructuring actions, including significant headcount reductions, 
will be necessary to meet the foregoing objectives of the 1996 
restructuring plan. The Company expects to recognize a charge 
for the estimated costs of those actions when the details of the 
related supplemental plan are announced later in the second 
quarter.

3.	On February 4, 1997, the Company acquired all of the 
outstanding shares of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"). NeXT, 
headquartered in Redwood City, California, develops, markets and 
supports software that enables customers to easily and quickly 
implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide 
Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. The 
comprehensive purchase price, which is comprised of $325 
million of cash; the issuance of 1.5 million shares of the 
Company's common stock; the issuance of approximately 1.8 
million options to purchase the Company's common stock; the 
assumption of approximately $55 million of net monetary 
liabilities; and approximately $5 million of closing and related 
costs, is expected to be approximately $430 million. The 
comprehensive purchase price is expected to require cash 
expenditures of approximately $385 million, substantially all of 
which will be expended in the second quarter. The acquisition 
will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes. The 
Company expects that approximately 75% of the comprehensive 
purchase price will be expensed as in-process research and 
development in the second quarter. 

4.	The information set forth in Item 1 of Part II hereof is hereby 
incorporated by reference.

Overview

During the first quarter of 1997, the Company continued to experience 
declines in net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer 
market. This continued decline in demand and the resulting operating 
loss, coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry, 
has led to the Company's announcement that supplemental restructuring 
actions, including significant headcount reductions,  will be necessary 
in order to reduce costs and return the Company to sustainable 
profitability. The details of those actions are expected to be announced 
later in the second quarter. The Company has also acquired NeXT. The 
Company plans to develop and market a new operating system ("OS") 
based on its Mac OS and NeXT software technologies.

Net Sales
Q1 97 compared with Q1 96
Net sales decreased 32% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and 
peripheral unit sales decreased 29% and 27%, respectively, in the first 
quarter of 1997, compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a 
decline in worldwide demand for most product families, especially the 
Performa(registered trademark) line of consumer-oriented products, 
which the Company believes was due principally to customer concerns 
regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition, and 
future prospects, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. In 
addition, Macintosh unit sales were negatively affected as a result of the 
Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders of 
PowerBook(registered trademark) and Power Macintosh(registered 
trademark) products due to product transition constraints on 
manufacturing and the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain 
components. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit 
decreased 10% in the first quarter of 1997
				8
<PAGE> 

compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to continued 
pricing actions, including rebates, across most product lines in order to 
stimulate demand. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product 
increased 12% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same 
period of 1996, as a result of a shift in mix toward higher priced 
products, partially offset by continued pricing actions, including 
rebates, across most product lines in order to stimulate demand.

International net sales represented 56% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1997 compared with 51% in the same period of 1996. 
International net sales declined 25% in the first quarter of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996. Net sales in European markets 
decreased during the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same period 
in 1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit 
remained constant in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same 
period of 1996. Net sales in Japan decreased during the first quarter of 
1997, compared with the same period in 1996, as a result of decreases 
in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue 
per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 40% in the first quarter of 1997, over the 
comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products and the average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the average aggregate 
revenue per peripheral unit.

According to an industry source, in the first quarter of 1997 compared 
with the comparable period of 1996, the Company's share of the 
worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 4.3% from 
7.0% and to 5.2% from 9.4%, respectively. In addition, the Company 
believes that its licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer 
market increased to approximately 0.5% from approximately 0.1%.

Q1 97 compared with Q4 96
Net sales decreased 8% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 
by less than 1% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the prior 
quarter as a result of a decline in unit sales of entry-level and 
PowerBook products, substantially offset by an increase in unit sales of 
Performa and Power Macintosh products.  PowerBook unit sales were 
negatively affected as a result of the Company's inability to fulfill all 
purchase orders due to product transition constraints on manufacturing.  
In addition, although Performa unit sales increased compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996, they were substantially lower than the Company 
expected for the holiday buying season.  Unit sales of peripheral 
products increased 11% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit decreased 11% and 2%, respectively, in the first 
quarter of 1997 compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily due 
to continued pricing actions, including rebates, taken on most product 
lines in order to stimulate demand.  The average revenue per Macintosh 
unit and per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward 
pressure due to a variety of factors, including industrywide pricing 
pressures, increased competition, and the need to stimulate demand for 
the Company's products. 

International net sales represented 56% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1997, compared with 47% in the fourth quarter of 1996. 
International net sales increased 9% in the first quarter of 1997 
compared with the fourth quarter of 1996. Net sales in European 
markets increased during the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996, as a result of increases in Macintosh and 
peripheral unit sales and average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, 
slightly offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit.  Net sales in Japan decreased during the first quarter of 
1997 compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, as a result of decreases 
in Macintosh unit sales and average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit, partially offset by an increase in peripheral unit 
sales over the prior quarter.

<PAGE> 

Domestic net sales declined 24% in the first quarter of 1997 compared 
with the prior quarter, due to decreases in Macintosh unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by 
increases in peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit.

According to an industry source, in the first quarter of 1997 compared 
with the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company's share of the worldwide 
and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 4.3% from 5.3%, and 
to 5.2% from 7.2%, respectively. In addition, the Company believes 
that its licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer market 
increased to approximately 0.5% from approximately 0.2%.

In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed 
basis. Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates 
depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders ("backlog") 
can be, and often are, canceled at will. The Company attempts to fill 
orders on the requested delivery schedules. The Company's backlog was 
approximately $454 million at January 31, 1997 and consisted 
primarily of the Company's PowerBook and PowerMacintosh products. 

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at 
any particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its 
future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in 
anticipation of or immediately following introduction of new products 
because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog 
often is reduced sharply once dealers and customers believe they can 
obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as other 
factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be 
considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any 
particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the fourth quarter of 
1997, if not longer. In addition, the Company believes that net sales in 
the second quarter of 1997 will be below the level of the first quarter of 
1997. 

Gross Margin
Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales 
and its cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated by the sale 
of products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company 
for its products relative to competitive products. The cost of goods sold 
is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, 
direct labor costs. The type and cost of components included in 
particular configurations of the Company's products (such as memory 
and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to market products 
in configurations competitive with other manufacturers. Competition in 
the personal computer industry is intense and, in the short term, 
frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary 
in order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term 
by actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide 
competitive pressures.

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 
1997, compared with the same period of 1996, primarily as a result of 
more aggressive pricing actions taken relative to product costs in the 
first quarter of 1996 in order to stimulate demand and increase market 
share.

Gross margin decreased as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 
1997, compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily as a result of 
continued pricing actions, including rebates, taken on most product 
lines in order to stimulate demand and reduced sales of fully reserved 
product, partially offset by a decrease in charges incurred to provide for 
the costs to correct certain quality problems in certain products. 




				10
<PAGE> 

The gross margin levels in the first quarter of 1997 compared with first 
and fourth quarters of 1996 were also slightly negatively impacted as a 
result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, 
partially offset by hedging gains. The Company's operating strategy and 
pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, 
the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the 
short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain the 
gross margin levels achieved in the first quarter of 1997. Gross margins 
will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of 
factors, including continued industrywide pricing pressures around the 
world, increased competition, and compressed product life cycles. In 
response to those downward pressures, the Company expects it will 
continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross 
margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively 
manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand 
for certain of its products.

increase as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level 
of net sales.
 
The Company believes its research and development expenditures will 
be relatively flat in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same 
period of the prior year and with the first quarter of 1997. The Company 
believes its research and development expenditures will decrease in the 
third and fourth quarters of 1997 compared with the same periods of the 
prior year and compared with the immediate prior quarters, as a result of 
expected actions under the Company's 1997 supplemental restructuring 
plan, the details of which will be announced later in the second quarter. 
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of NeXT, the Company 
believes it will take a substantial charge to in-process research and 
development at the time of the completion of the purchase which 
occurred in the second quarter. For additional information regarding the 
1997 supplemental restructuring plan and the acquisition of NeXT, refer

Form 10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in 
the marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely 
development of new and enhanced products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount in the 
first quarter of 1997 when compared with the corresponding period of 
1996, primarily due to reduced expenditures as a result of actions taken 
under the Company's 1996 restructuring plan. Selling, general and 
administrative expenses increased in amount in the first quarter of 1997 
when compared with the fourth quarter of 1996 primarily as a result of 
increased advertising and marketing expenditures incurred during the 
holiday buying season. Selling, general and administrative expenses 
increased as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 1997 when 
compared to the first and fourth quarters of 1996, as a result of a 
decrease in the level of net sales.  

The Company believes its selling, general and administrative 
expenditures will decrease slightly in the second quarter of 1997 
compared with the first quarter of 1997, as a result of lower advertising 
and marketing expenditures and further implementation of the 1996 
restructuring plan. The Company believes its selling, general and 
administrative expenditures will decrease in the third and fourth quarters 
of 1997 compared with the same quarters of the prior year and compared 
with the immediate prior quarters, as a result of its anticipated actions 
under the 1997 supplemental restructuring plan, the details of which 
will be announced later in the second quarter, partially offset by the 
amortization expense on the intangible assets the Company expects to 
recognize as a result of the acquisition of NeXT. For additional

The Company recently announced that supplemental restructuring 
actions, including significant headcount reductions, will be necessary to 
meet the objectives of the 1996 restructuring plan.  The Company 
expects to recognize a charge for the estimated costs of those actions 
when the details of the related supplemental plan are announced later in 
the second quarter.

Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased slightly in the first 
quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, primarily as a 
result of lower net gains on foreign exchange instruments, partially 
offset by higher interest income.  Interest and other income (expense), 
net, was relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 
the fourth quarter of 1996.  The Company expects interest income to 
decrease in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1997 compared with 
the immediate prior quarters, due to lower cash balances as a result of 
cash used to acquire NeXT, fund the 1997 supplemental restructuring 
actions and the remaining 1996 restructuring actions, and fund 
operations over at least the next two quarters.

In January 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and Poor's 
Rating Agency. The Company was also placed on negative credit watch 
by Moody's Investor Services. These actions could increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods.

At December 27, 1996, the Company had deferred tax assets arising 
from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of 
$519 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities 
for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion 
of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred 
tax liabilities. In the first quarter a valuation allowance of $41 million 
was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses 
which may not be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of 
the asset is dependent on the 
				13
<PAGE> 

Company's ability to generate approximately $245 million of future 
U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more likely than 
not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. income. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its 
expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the amount of the 
deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and 
long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such 
an occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial 
results and condition. The Company will continue to evaluate the 
realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for 
and amount of the valuation allowance.


Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are 
dependent on the Company's ability to successfully develop, 
manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in order to 
meet dynamic customer demand patterns, and its ability to effect a 
change in marketplace perception of the Company's prospects. Inherent 
in this process are a number of factors that the Company must 
successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating 
results and financial condition. Potential risks and uncertainties that 
could affect the Company's future operating results and financial 
condition include, without limitation, continued competitive pressures 
in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; 
the Company's ability to supply products in certain categories; the 
Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of 
technological innovations, including its ability to make timely delivery 
of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely 
delivery of a new and substantially backward-compatible OS; the 
Company's ability to successfully integrate NeXT technologies, 
processes and employees with those at Apple; uncertainties concerning 
the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction 
and restructuring actions, including the expected supplemental 
restructuring actions; the effects of significant adverse publicity; and the 
availability of third-party software for particular applications.

The Company expects to incur a substantial loss in the second quarter 
as a result of the aforementioned in-process research and development 
and restructuring charges, and the aforementioned expected decrease in 
net sales compared with the first quarter of 1997. The Company expects 
that it will not return to profitability until at least the fourth quarter of 
1997, if not later.

Restructuring of Operations and  New Business Model

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring 
actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its 
competitiveness, and restoring sustained profitability. The Company 
recently announced that supplemental restructuring actions, including 
significant headcount reductions, will be necessary in order to meet the 
foregoing objectives. The details of the 1997 supplemental restructuring 
plan will be announced later in the second quarter. There are several 
risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost 
structure. These include the risk that the Company will not be able to 
reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore sustained profitability and 
the risk that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability 
to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has been implementing 
a new business model. Implementation of the new business model 
involves several risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product 
line the Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, 
potentially reduce overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven 
products and technology. Another risk of the new business model is 
that by increasing the proportion of the Company's products to be 
manufactured under outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose 
control of the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or lose 
the flexibility to make timely changes
 
				14
<PAGE> 

in production schedules in order to respond to changing market 
conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely affect 
employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and 
motivate employees. Also, because the new business model 
contemplates that the Company will rely to a greater extent on 
collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, the 
Company will have less direct control over certain of its research and 
development efforts, and its ability to create innovative new products 
may be reduced. In addition, the new business model now includes the 
acquisition of NeXT. There can be no assurance that the technologies 
acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key NeXT 
employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated 
with those at Apple. Finally, even if the new business model is 
successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will 
effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In 
addition, although the Company believes that the actions it is taking 
and will take under its current and supplemental restructuring plans, and 
its acquisition of NeXT, should help restore marketplace confidence in 
the Macintosh platform, there can be no assurance that such actions 
will be successful.

For the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the new 
business model, including the restructuring actions and the acquisition 
of NeXT, will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing 
its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustained profitability. The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter 
difficulty in effectively managing the transition to the new business 
model and cost structure.

For information regarding the Company's restructuring actions and the 
acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, 
and to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this 
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is hereby 
incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, 
which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid 
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new 
products and product enhancements.  The success of new product 
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market 
acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with 
product transitions, the availability of application software for new 
products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate 
quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products 
may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.  
Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that 
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.  In 
addition, although the number of new product introductions may 
decrease under the Company's new business model, the risks and 
uncertainties associated with new product introductions may increase as 
the Company refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a 
new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of 
shipments for that product, which depends on many factors, some of 
which are not under the control of the Company. These factors may 
include initial large purchases by a small segment of the user 
population that tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance 
by the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of 
pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology and, as a 
result, deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers 
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. These 
factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of purchases by 
many users until new technology is accepted as "proven" and for which 
commonly used software products are available; and the reduction of 
orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of 
products previously in backlog. 


				15
<PAGE> 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with 
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe 
they can obtain sufficient supply of the new products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further 
complicated by the availability of different product configurations, 
which may include various types of built-in peripherals and software. 
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) 
for various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas 
may be a function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of European-language 
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag 
behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may 
result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside 
the United States, even though localized versions of the Company's 
products may be available.

The increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations of 
the Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other 
faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of 
products have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were 
significant, the Company could incur material recall and replacement 
costs under product warranties.

The Company recently announced a "dual track" approach to its OS 
development. The Company plans to continue to introduce 
enhancements to the current Mac OS and later introduce a new OS (code 
named "Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced functionality 
based upon the Mac OS and NeXT software technologies. However, the 
NeXT software technologies that the Company plans to use in the 
development of Rhapsody were not originally designed to be compatible 
with the Mac OS. As a result, there can be no assurance that the 
development of Rhapsody will be successful. In addition, Rhapsody 
may not be fully backward-compatible with existing applications, 
which could result in a loss of existing customers. Finally, it is 
uncertain whether Rhapsody or the planned enhancements to the current 
Mac OS will gain developer support and market acceptance. Inability to 
successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially 
backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to the 
current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market acceptance for 
those operating systems, may have an adverse impact on the 
Company's operating results and financial condition.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on 
gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life 
cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance 
characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large 
number of competitors. The Company's results of operations and 
financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, 
adversely affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward 
pressures on gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by 
rapid technological advances in software functionality and hardware 
performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources; broader product 
lines; and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer 
preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features 
over another.







				16
<PAGE> 

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the 
Macintosh operating system ("Mac(registered trademark) OS"). The Mac 
OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, 
which is dominated by makers of computers that run the MS-DOS and 
Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company believes that the 
Mac OS, with its perceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, 
has been a driving force behind sales of the Company's personal 
computer hardware for the past several years. Recent innovations in the 
Windows platform, including those introduced by Windows 95, have 
added features to the Windows platform similar to those offered by the 
Mac OS. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take 
steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the 
Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition may be affected by its ability to maintain and 
increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.  

As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh 
platform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other 
personal computer vendors in January 1995, as well as an additional 
licensing initiative in 1996. Several vendors currently sell products that 
utilize the Macintosh operating system. The Company believes that 
licensing the operating system will result in a broader installed base on 
which software vendors can develop and provide technical innovations 
for the Macintosh platform. However, there can be no assurance that the 
installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the operating 
system or that licensing will result in an increase in the number of 
application software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring to 
market application software based on the Mac OS. In addition, as a 
result of licensing its operating system, the Company competes with 
other companies producing Mac OS-based computer systems. The 
benefits to the Company from licensing the Mac OS to third parties 
may be more than offset by the disadvantages of competing with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS 
and Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward 
developing personal computer products capable of running application 
software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems 
("Cross-Platform Products"). These products include the RISC-based 
PowerPC(trademark) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 
586-class microprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing 
a Pentium or 586-class microprocessor. These products enable users to 
run concurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, 
Windows 3.1, or Windows 95 operating systems. 

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers 
who purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system 
software under licensing agreements with Microsoft. However, in order 
to do so, the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements 
with certain Microsoft distributors.

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") 
and Motorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of 
specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware reference 
platform. These specifications define a "unified" personal computer 
architecture that gives access to both the Power Macintosh platform and 
the PC environment and utilizes standard industry components. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by its ability to continue to implement this agreement and to 
manage the risk associated with the transition to this new hardware 
reference platform.

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal 
computers, as opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are 
often based on the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications. The Company believes that the availability of third-party 
application software for the Company's hardware products depends in 
part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative 
benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for 
the Company's products versus software for the larger MS-DOS and 
Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived 
strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential 
revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing such 
software products.  To the extent

				17
<PAGE> 

the Company's recent financial losses and declining demand for the 
Company's product have caused software developers to question the 
Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could 
be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing 
software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their 
resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS 
and Windows market. Microsoft Corporation is an important developer 
of application software for the Company's products. Accordingly, 
Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the 
Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its 
interests as the vendor of the Windows operating systems. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is 
also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the 
suppliers of the PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the 
Company's products, to supply to the Company in adequate numbers 
microprocessors that produce superior price/performance results 
compared with those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel 
Corporation, the developer and producer of the microprocessors used by 
most personal computers using the MS-DOS and Windows operating 
systems. IBM produces personal computers based on Intel 
microprocessors as well as workstations based on the PowerPC 
microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing 
operating system to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's 
interest in supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the 
Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its 
interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a 
competing operating system vendor.  

Several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and 
Microsoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target 
certain of the Company's key market segments, including education and 
publishing. Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.

The Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and 
existing hardware and software platforms. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to continue to do so successfully. In 
addition, the Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by 
an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or 
developed products addressing access to, authoring for, or 
communication over, the Internet. Many of these competitors have a 
significant lead over the Company in developing products for the 
Internet, have significantly greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, 
and technological resources than the Company, or both.


Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's operations and 
financial results could be significantly affected by international factors, 
such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic 
conditions in the foreign markets in which the Company distributes its 
products. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the 
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the 
U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based 
sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. 
dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases 
when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net 
receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits 
from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar 
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in 
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may 
negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross margins 
(as expressed in U.S. dollars). 


				18
<PAGE> 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange 
rates on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product 
procurement, and operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its 
non-U.S. dollar-based exposures. Specifically, the Company enters into 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge its assets, 
liabilities and firmly committed transactions. Currently, hedges of 
firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year. The 
Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge 
certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions. Hedges of 
probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not extend 
beyond one year. To reduce the costs associated with these ongoing 
foreign exchange hedging programs, the Company also regularly sells 
foreign exchange option contracts and enters into certain other foreign 
exchange transactions. All foreign exchange forward and option 
contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions intended 
to reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange 
hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each 
balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the 
interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the 
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to 
fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, 
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the 
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well 
as interest paid on its notes payable to banks and long-term debt. To 
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company 
has entered into interest rate swap, collar, and floor transactions. Certain 
of these transactions are intended to better match the Company's 
floating-rate interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments with the fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term 
debt. The Company also enters into these transactions in order to 
diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations 
in short-term U.S. interest rates. These instruments may extend the 
Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum duration of three 
years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign 
exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the 
risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company 
continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, 
and its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-
alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and 
interest rate-related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting 
and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of 
the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance 
that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the 
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in 
either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the 
accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market 
instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of 
gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, 
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and 
financial position. The Company generally does not engage in leveraged 
hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition is expected to increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of the 
hedging transactions into which the Company's counterparties are 
willing to enter.

Inventory and Supply

The Company provides reserves against any inventories of products that 
have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand, accrues for 
any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled, 
and accrues for the estimated costs to correct any product quality 
problems.  Although the Company believes its inventory and related 
reserves are adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will 
not incur additional inventory and related charges.  In addition, such 
charges have had, and may again have, a material affect on the 
Company's financial position and results of operations.


				19
<PAGE> 

The Company must order components for its products and build 
inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the 
Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and 
price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast incorrectly 
and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. The 
Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the 
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the 
Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-
term shifts in customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part 
by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of 
the Company or otherwise. As a result of the Company's restructuring 
actions, which include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, the proportion of the 
Company's products produced and distributed under outsourcing 
arrangements will increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower 
the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the 
Company has over production. It is uncertain what effect such 
diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products 
manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing 
market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage 
its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement.  

Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain 
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains 
at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty 
service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty 
liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated 
product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements 
with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be 
limited by the availability of key components. The Company believes 
that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of 
microprocessors and ASICS presents the most significant potential for 
constraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some 
advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up 
for production and thus have limited availability. The Company and 
other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for 
other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced 
increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer 
demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the 
cellular phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses 
some components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). 
Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers 
were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components 
instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. 
Such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could 
decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's 
operating results and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of 
the Company's products. Currently, the Company's primary means of 
distribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers 
include consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer 
electronics outlets, and computer superstores. The Company's business 
and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition 
of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels 
were to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.





20
<PAGE> 

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause 
resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's 
products. Under the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers 
have the option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, 
in most instances without financial penalty. Resellers also have the 
option to return products to the Company without penalty within 
certain limits, beyond which they may be assessed fees. The Company 
has experienced a reduction in ordering from historical levels by 
resellers due to uncertainty concerning the Company's condition and 
prospects.

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its 
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including 
certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The 
Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially 
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries 
may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations 
which include, in some instances, the requirement that the Company 
provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at 
the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally 
safe disposal or recycling with the Company. It is unclear what effect 
such regulation will have on the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition.

The Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing 
transaction systems (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated system 
as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition could be 
adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and 
effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system.  

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its 
Napa, California, data center to MCI Systemhouse ("MCI"), and entered 
into a data processing outsourcing agreement with MCI. While this 
outsourcing agreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of 
operations, it will also reduce the direct control the Company has over 
its data processing. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control 
will have on the Company's data processing.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial 
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's 
participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant 
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, 
increased to $1,627 million at December 27, 1996, from $1,559 
million at September 27, 1996. The Company's financial position with 
respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased 
to $1,807 million at December 27, 1996, from $1,745 million at 
September 27, 1996. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance 
at December 27, 1996 and September 27, 1996, includes $174 million 
and $177 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters 
of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase 
commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, 
Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first quarter of 1997 totaled $94 
million, primarily the result of a decrease in inventories, partially offset 
by the Company's net loss. The Company expects to use cash to fund 
operations over at least the remainder of 1997, if not longer.

				21
<PAGE>

The Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity 
investments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less 
for the remainder of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996. Cash 
used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $20 
million in the first three months of 1997, and consisted primarily of 
increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The Company 
expects that the level of capital expenditures for the remainder of 1997 
will be comparable to the same period of 1996.

In January 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and Poor's 
Rating Agency. The Company was also placed on negative credit watch 
by Moody's Investor Services. These actions may increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods. In addition, the Company 
may be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of 
its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to more stringent 
covenants than in the past. 

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents 
and short-term investments, together with continued short-term 
borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
over the next 12 months. In addition to funding net losses over at least 
the next two quarters, expected cash requirements include, without 
limitation, an estimated $385 million for the acquisition of NeXT, an 
estimated $59 million to complete the remaining actions under the 
1996 restructuring plan, and an as yet unquantified amount for the 
actions under the expected 1997 supplemental restructuring plan. No 
assurance can be given that short-term borrowings from banks can be 
continued, or that any additional required financing could be obtained 
should the restructuring plans take longer to implement than anticipated 
or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, 
its liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition would be 
materially adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has 
made certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the 
proposed deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the 
issues in dispute for these years have been resolved. On June 29, 1995, 
the IRS issued a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount 
of the Company's federal income taxes for the years 1989 through 
1991. The Company has filed a petition with the United States Tax 
Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies. Management believes 
that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from these tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 45 of the Company's 1996 Annual Report on 
Form 10-K under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain 
purported shareholder class action suits, certain consumer class actions 
relating to monitor-size advertising, and "repetitive stress injury" 
claims.

In December 1996, the Company filed a demurrer to the first amended 
complaint in the case styled Derek Pritchard v. Michael Spindler et al., 
and in January 1997 filed a demurrer to the complaint in the action 
entitled LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael 
Spindler et al. 

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with third 
parties, investigations and pending actions involving allegations of 
false or misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, 
infringement of intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and 
other matters against the Company  and its subsidiaries incident to the 
operation of its business. The liability, if any, associated with these 
matters was not determinable as of the date of this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported 
in the accompanying financial statements. However, depending on the 
amount and timing of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is 
possible that the Company's future results of operations or cash flows 
could be materially affected in a particular period.

Vice President and General Counsel of the Company and shall report 
directly to me and your duties and responsibilities to the Company shall 
be consistent in all respects with such position. You shall devote 
substantially all of your business time, attention, skills and efforts 
exclusively to the business and affairs of the Company, other than de 
minimis  amounts of time devoted by you to the management of your 
personal finances or to engaging in charitable or community services. 
Your principal place of employment shall be the executive offices of 
the Company in Cupertino, California, although you understand and 
agree that you will be required to travel from time to time for business 
purposes. 

		3.	Compensation.

		(a)	Base Salary.  As compensation to you for all 
services rendered to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company 
will pay you a base salary at the rate of not less than three hundred 
sixty thousand dollars ($360,000) per annum as of the Effective Date. 
Your base salary will be paid to you in accordance with the Company's 
regular payroll practices applicable to its executive employees.

		(b)	Bonus.  You shall be eligible to participate 
in the annual Senior Executive Bonus Plan (domestic) sponsored by the 
Company or any successor plan thereto. Such bonus program shall 
afford you the opportunity to earn an annual bonus for each fiscal year 
of the Company during your employment. During the Company's 
Fiscal Year 1997 only, your Target Annual Bonus shall be 67% of your 
Base Compensation, or two hundred forty one thousand, two hundred 
dollars ($241,200) prorated for that portion of the Company's Fiscal 
Year 1997 during
				71

which you are employed.  The amount of your Target Annual Bonus 
thereafter, expressed as a percentage of your Base Compensation, shall 
be reviewed annually by the Company but shall not be less than 67%

position of Senior Vice President and General Counsel.  Each annual 
bonus shall be paid to you in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of the bonus plan then in effect.

	(c)	Hiring Bonus.  Subject to other provisions

		6.	Definitions.  For purposes of this 
Agreement, the following capitalized words shall have the meanings set 
forth below:

		"Cause" shall mean a termination of your

information related to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries 
or (iii) your willful and continued failure substantially to perform your 
duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from

anticipated failure resulting from a resignation by you) after a written 
demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the 
Company's Chief Executive Officer, which demand specifically 
identifies the manner in which the Company believes that you have not 
substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not 
substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such demand.   
For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your 
part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by

omission was in the best interest of the Company.

		8.	Miscellaneous.  

		(a)	Amendments, Waivers, Etc.  No provision 
of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such 
waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing.  No waiver by 
either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto 
of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement 
to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar 
or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or 
subsequent time.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, 
express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been 
made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this 
Agreement and this Agreement shall supersede all prior agreements, 
negotiations, correspondence, undertakings and communications of the 
parties, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

affect the rights of the parties to this Agreement.

APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited)

1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the 
Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair 
statement of interim results have been included. All adjustments 
are of a normal recurring nature unless specified in a separate 
note included in these Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. These 
financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with 
the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and the 
notes thereto for the fiscal year ended September 27, 1996, 
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
September 27, 1996 (the "1996 Form 10-K").

2.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began 
to implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and 
restoring profitability to the Company's operations. The 
restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for 
Company products and the Company's adoption of a new 
strategic direction. The restructuring actions under this plan that 
the Company has taken and intends to take consist primarily of 
terminating approximately 1,500 full-time employees (down 
from an initial planned termination of approximately 2,800), 
approximately 900 of whom have been terminated from plan 
inception through December 27, 1996, excluding employees who 
were hired by SCI Systems, Inc. and MCI Systemhouse, the 
purchasers of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing 
facility and the Napa, California data center facility, respectively;
canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of these 
employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings and 
equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and 
outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling 
contracts as a result of terminating eWorld(trademark), Apple's 
on-line service. These actions resulted in an initial charge of 
$207 million. The charge was adjusted downward by $28 million 
in the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily as a result of greater than 
expected voluntary terminations, which led to fewer than planned 
involuntary terminations, as well as lower than expected costs to 
cancel or vacate certain facility leases, partially offset by greater 
than expected costs to cancel certain contracts and to write down 
certain operating assets sold or to be sold.  The restructuring 
actions have resulted in cash expenditures of $66 million and 
noncash asset write-downs of $8 million from plan inception 
through December 27, 1996. The Company expects that the 
remaining $105 million accrued balance at December 27, 1996, 
will result in cash expenditures of approximately $50 million 
over the next twelve months and approximately $9 million 
thereafter. The Company expects that most of the contemplated 
restructuring actions related to the plan implemented in the 
second quarter of 1996 will be completed within the next six 
months and will be financed through current working capital and 
continued short-term borrowings.

	The Company recently announced that supplemental 
restructuring actions, including significant headcount reductions, 
will be necessary to meet the foregoing objectives of the 1996 
restructuring plan. The Company expects to recognize a charge 
for the estimated costs of those actions when the details of the 
related supplemental plan are announced later in the second 
quarter.

3.	On February 4, 1997, the Company acquired all of the 
outstanding shares of NeXT Software, Inc. ("NeXT"). NeXT, 
headquartered in Redwood City, California, develops, markets and 
supports software that enables customers to easily and quickly 
implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide 
Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. The 
comprehensive purchase price, which is comprised of $325 
million of cash; the issuance of 1.5 million shares of the 
Company's common stock; the issuance of approximately 1.8 
million options to purchase the Company's common stock; the 
assumption of approximately $55 million of net monetary 
liabilities; and approximately $5 million of closing and related 
costs, is expected to be approximately $430 million. The 
comprehensive purchase price is expected to require cash 
expenditures of approximately $385 million, substantially all of 
which will be expended in the second quarter. The acquisition 
will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes. The 
Company expects that approximately 75% of the comprehensive 
purchase price will be expensed as in-process research and 
development in the second quarter. 

4.	The information set forth in Item 1 of Part II hereof is hereby 
incorporated by reference.

Overview

During the first quarter of 1997, the Company continued to experience 
declines in net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer 
market. This continued decline in demand and the resulting operating 
loss, coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry, 
has led to the Company's announcement that supplemental restructuring 
actions, including significant headcount reductions,  will be necessary 
in order to reduce costs and return the Company to sustainable 
profitability. The details of those actions are expected to be announced 
later in the second quarter. The Company has also acquired NeXT. The 
Company plans to develop and market a new operating system ("OS") 
based on its Mac OS and NeXT software technologies.

Net Sales
Q1 97 compared with Q1 96
Net sales decreased 32% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
same period of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and 
peripheral unit sales decreased 29% and 27%, respectively, in the first 
quarter of 1997, compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of a 
decline in worldwide demand for most product families, especially the 
Performa(registered trademark) line of consumer-oriented products, 
which the Company believes was due principally to customer concerns 
regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition, and 
future prospects, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. In 
addition, Macintosh unit sales were negatively affected as a result of the 
Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders of 
PowerBook(registered trademark) and Power Macintosh(registered 
trademark) products due to product transition constraints on 
manufacturing and the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain 
components. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit 
decreased 10% in the first quarter of 1997
				8
<PAGE> 

compared with the same period of 1996, primarily due to continued 
pricing actions, including rebates, across most product lines in order to 
stimulate demand. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product 
increased 12% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same 
period of 1996, as a result of a shift in mix toward higher priced 
products, partially offset by continued pricing actions, including 
rebates, across most product lines in order to stimulate demand.

International net sales represented 56% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1997 compared with 51% in the same period of 1996. 
International net sales declined 25% in the first quarter of 1997 
compared with the same period of 1996. Net sales in European markets 
decreased during the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same period 
in 1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, 
partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit 
remained constant in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the same 
period of 1996. Net sales in Japan decreased during the first quarter of 
1997, compared with the same period in 1996, as a result of decreases 
in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue 
per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the average 
aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.  

Domestic net sales declined 40% in the first quarter of 1997, over the 
comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh 
computers and peripheral products and the average aggregate revenue per 
Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the average aggregate 
revenue per peripheral unit.

According to an industry source, in the first quarter of 1997 compared 
with the comparable period of 1996, the Company's share of the 
worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 4.3% from 
7.0% and to 5.2% from 9.4%, respectively. In addition, the Company 
believes that its licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer 
market increased to approximately 0.5% from approximately 0.1%.

Q1 97 compared with Q4 96
Net sales decreased 8% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 
by less than 1% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the prior 
quarter as a result of a decline in unit sales of entry-level and 
PowerBook products, substantially offset by an increase in unit sales of 
Performa and Power Macintosh products.  PowerBook unit sales were 
negatively affected as a result of the Company's inability to fulfill all 
purchase orders due to product transition constraints on manufacturing.  
In addition, although Performa unit sales increased compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996, they were substantially lower than the Company 
expected for the holiday buying season.  Unit sales of peripheral 
products increased 11% in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit decreased 11% and 2%, respectively, in the first 
quarter of 1997 compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily due 
to continued pricing actions, including rebates, taken on most product 
lines in order to stimulate demand.  The average revenue per Macintosh 
unit and per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward 
pressure due to a variety of factors, including industrywide pricing 
pressures, increased competition, and the need to stimulate demand for 
the Company's products. 

International net sales represented 56% of total net sales in the first 
quarter of 1997, compared with 47% in the fourth quarter of 1996. 
International net sales increased 9% in the first quarter of 1997 
compared with the fourth quarter of 1996. Net sales in European 
markets increased during the first quarter of 1997 compared with the 
fourth quarter of 1996, as a result of increases in Macintosh and 
peripheral unit sales and average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, 
slightly offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit.  Net sales in Japan decreased during the first quarter of 
1997 compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, as a result of decreases 
in Macintosh unit sales and average aggregate revenue per Macintosh 
and peripheral unit, partially offset by an increase in peripheral unit 
sales over the prior quarter.

<PAGE> 

Domestic net sales declined 24% in the first quarter of 1997 compared 
with the prior quarter, due to decreases in Macintosh unit sales and the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by 
increases in peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue per 
peripheral unit.

According to an industry source, in the first quarter of 1997 compared 
with the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company's share of the worldwide 
and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 4.3% from 5.3%, and 
to 5.2% from 7.2%, respectively. In addition, the Company believes 
that its licensees' share of the worldwide personal computer market 
increased to approximately 0.5% from approximately 0.2%.

In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed 
basis. Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates 
depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders ("backlog") 
can be, and often are, canceled at will. The Company attempts to fill 
orders on the requested delivery schedules. The Company's backlog was 
approximately $454 million at January 31, 1997 and consisted 
primarily of the Company's PowerBook and PowerMacintosh products. 

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at 
any particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its 
future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in 
anticipation of or immediately following introduction of new products 
because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog 
often is reduced sharply once dealers and customers believe they can 
obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as other 
factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be 
considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any 
particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the 
prior year's comparable periods through at least the fourth quarter of 
1997, if not longer. In addition, the Company believes that net sales in 
the second quarter of 1997 will be below the level of the first quarter of 
1997. 

Gross Margin
Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales 
and its cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated by the sale 
of products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company 
for its products relative to competitive products. The cost of goods sold 
is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, 
direct labor costs. The type and cost of components included in 
particular configurations of the Company's products (such as memory 
and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to market products 
in configurations competitive with other manufacturers. Competition in 
the personal computer industry is intense and, in the short term, 
frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary 
in order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a 
percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term 
by actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide 
competitive pressures.

Gross margin increased as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 
1997, compared with the same period of 1996, primarily as a result of 
more aggressive pricing actions taken relative to product costs in the 
first quarter of 1996 in order to stimulate demand and increase market 
share.

Gross margin decreased as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 
1997, compared with the fourth quarter of 1996, primarily as a result of 
continued pricing actions, including rebates, taken on most product 
lines in order to stimulate demand and reduced sales of fully reserved 
product, partially offset by a decrease in charges incurred to provide for 
the costs to correct certain quality problems in certain products. 




				10
<PAGE> 

The gross margin levels in the first quarter of 1997 compared with first 
and fourth quarters of 1996 were also slightly negatively impacted as a 
result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies, 
partially offset by hedging gains. The Company's operating strategy and 
pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, 
the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the 
short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain the 
gross margin levels achieved in the first quarter of 1997. Gross margins 
will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of 
factors, including continued industrywide pricing pressures around the 
world, increased competition, and compressed product life cycles. In 
response to those downward pressures, the Company expects it will 
continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross 
margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively 
manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand 
for certain of its products.

increase as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level 
of net sales.
 
The Company believes its research and development expenditures will 
be relatively flat in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same 
period of the prior year and with the first quarter of 1997. The Company 
believes its research and development expenditures will decrease in the 
third and fourth quarters of 1997 compared with the same periods of the 
prior year and compared with the immediate prior quarters, as a result of 
expected actions under the Company's 1997 supplemental restructuring 
plan, the details of which will be announced later in the second quarter. 
In addition, as a result of the acquisition of NeXT, the Company 
believes it will take a substantial charge to in-process research and 
development at the time of the completion of the purchase which 
occurred in the second quarter. For additional information regarding the 
1997 supplemental restructuring plan and the acquisition of NeXT, refer

Form 10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

The Company believes that continued investments in research and 
development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in 
the marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely 
development of new and enhanced products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount in the 
first quarter of 1997 when compared with the corresponding period of 
1996, primarily due to reduced expenditures as a result of actions taken 
under the Company's 1996 restructuring plan. Selling, general and 
administrative expenses increased in amount in the first quarter of 1997 
when compared with the fourth quarter of 1996 primarily as a result of 
increased advertising and marketing expenditures incurred during the 
holiday buying season. Selling, general and administrative expenses 
increased as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter of 1997 when 
compared to the first and fourth quarters of 1996, as a result of a 
decrease in the level of net sales.  

The Company believes its selling, general and administrative 
expenditures will decrease slightly in the second quarter of 1997 
compared with the first quarter of 1997, as a result of lower advertising 
and marketing expenditures and further implementation of the 1996 
restructuring plan. The Company believes its selling, general and 
administrative expenditures will decrease in the third and fourth quarters 
of 1997 compared with the same quarters of the prior year and compared 
with the immediate prior quarters, as a result of its anticipated actions 
under the 1997 supplemental restructuring plan, the details of which 
will be announced later in the second quarter, partially offset by the 
amortization expense on the intangible assets the Company expects to 
recognize as a result of the acquisition of NeXT. For additional

The Company recently announced that supplemental restructuring 
actions, including significant headcount reductions, will be necessary to 
meet the objectives of the 1996 restructuring plan.  The Company 
expects to recognize a charge for the estimated costs of those actions 
when the details of the related supplemental plan are announced later in 
the second quarter.

Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased slightly in the first 
quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, primarily as a 
result of lower net gains on foreign exchange instruments, partially 
offset by higher interest income.  Interest and other income (expense), 
net, was relatively unchanged in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 
the fourth quarter of 1996.  The Company expects interest income to 
decrease in the second, third and fourth quarters of 1997 compared with 
the immediate prior quarters, due to lower cash balances as a result of 
cash used to acquire NeXT, fund the 1997 supplemental restructuring 
actions and the remaining 1996 restructuring actions, and fund 
operations over at least the next two quarters.

In January 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and Poor's 
Rating Agency. The Company was also placed on negative credit watch 
by Moody's Investor Services. These actions could increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods.

At December 27, 1996, the Company had deferred tax assets arising 
from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of 
$519 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities 
for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion 
of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred 
tax liabilities. In the first quarter a valuation allowance of $41 million 
was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses 
which may not be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of 
the asset is dependent on the 
				13
<PAGE> 

Company's ability to generate approximately $245 million of future 
U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more likely than 
not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. income. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its 
expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the amount of the 
deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and 
long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such 
an occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial 
results and condition. The Company will continue to evaluate the 
realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for 
and amount of the valuation allowance.


Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial 
Condition

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are 
dependent on the Company's ability to successfully develop, 
manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in order to 
meet dynamic customer demand patterns, and its ability to effect a 
change in marketplace perception of the Company's prospects. Inherent 
in this process are a number of factors that the Company must 
successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating 
results and financial condition. Potential risks and uncertainties that 
could affect the Company's future operating results and financial 
condition include, without limitation, continued competitive pressures 
in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to 
such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; 
the Company's ability to supply products in certain categories; the 
Company's ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of 
technological innovations, including its ability to make timely delivery 
of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely 
delivery of a new and substantially backward-compatible OS; the 
Company's ability to successfully integrate NeXT technologies, 
processes and employees with those at Apple; uncertainties concerning 
the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction 
and restructuring actions, including the expected supplemental 
restructuring actions; the effects of significant adverse publicity; and the 
availability of third-party software for particular applications.

The Company expects to incur a substantial loss in the second quarter 
as a result of the aforementioned in-process research and development 
and restructuring charges, and the aforementioned expected decrease in 
net sales compared with the first quarter of 1997. The Company expects 
that it will not return to profitability until at least the fourth quarter of 
1997, if not later.

Restructuring of Operations and  New Business Model

During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring 
actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its 
competitiveness, and restoring sustained profitability. The Company 
recently announced that supplemental restructuring actions, including 
significant headcount reductions, will be necessary in order to meet the 
foregoing objectives. The details of the 1997 supplemental restructuring 
plan will be announced later in the second quarter. There are several 
risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost 
structure. These include the risk that the Company will not be able to 
reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore sustained profitability and 
the risk that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability 
to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has been implementing 
a new business model. Implementation of the new business model 
involves several risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product 
line the Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, 
potentially reduce overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven 
products and technology. Another risk of the new business model is 
that by increasing the proportion of the Company's products to be 
manufactured under outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose 
control of the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or lose 
the flexibility to make timely changes
 
				14
<PAGE> 

in production schedules in order to respond to changing market 
conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely affect 
employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and 
motivate employees. Also, because the new business model 
contemplates that the Company will rely to a greater extent on 
collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, the 
Company will have less direct control over certain of its research and 
development efforts, and its ability to create innovative new products 
may be reduced. In addition, the new business model now includes the 
acquisition of NeXT. There can be no assurance that the technologies 
acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key NeXT 
employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated 
with those at Apple. Finally, even if the new business model is 
successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will 
effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In 
addition, although the Company believes that the actions it is taking 
and will take under its current and supplemental restructuring plans, and 
its acquisition of NeXT, should help restore marketplace confidence in 
the Macintosh platform, there can be no assurance that such actions 
will be successful.

For the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the new 
business model, including the restructuring actions and the acquisition 
of NeXT, will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing 
its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring 
sustained profitability. The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter 
difficulty in effectively managing the transition to the new business 
model and cost structure.

For information regarding the Company's restructuring actions and the 
acquisition of NeXT, refer to Notes 2 and 3, respectively, of the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, 
and to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this 
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is hereby 
incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, 
which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid 
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new 
products and product enhancements.  The success of new product 
introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market 
acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with 
product transitions, the availability of application software for new 
products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with 
anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate 
quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products 
may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.  
Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that 
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.  In 
addition, although the number of new product introductions may 
decrease under the Company's new business model, the risks and 
uncertainties associated with new product introductions may increase as 
the Company refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments.

The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a 
new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of 
shipments for that product, which depends on many factors, some of 
which are not under the control of the Company. These factors may 
include initial large purchases by a small segment of the user 
population that tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance 
by the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of 
pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology and, as a 
result, deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers 
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. These 
factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of purchases by 
many users until new technology is accepted as "proven" and for which 
commonly used software products are available; and the reduction of 
orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of 
products previously in backlog. 


				15
<PAGE> 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with 
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe 
they can obtain sufficient supply of the new products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further 
complicated by the availability of different product configurations, 
which may include various types of built-in peripherals and software. 
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) 
for various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas 
may be a function of the availability of third-party software in those 
localized versions. For example, the availability of European-language 
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag 
behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may 
result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside 
the United States, even though localized versions of the Company's 
products may be available.

The increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations of 
the Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other 
faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of 
products have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were 
significant, the Company could incur material recall and replacement 
costs under product warranties.

The Company recently announced a "dual track" approach to its OS 
development. The Company plans to continue to introduce 
enhancements to the current Mac OS and later introduce a new OS (code 
named "Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced functionality 
based upon the Mac OS and NeXT software technologies. However, the 
NeXT software technologies that the Company plans to use in the 
development of Rhapsody were not originally designed to be compatible 
with the Mac OS. As a result, there can be no assurance that the 
development of Rhapsody will be successful. In addition, Rhapsody 
may not be fully backward-compatible with existing applications, 
which could result in a loss of existing customers. Finally, it is 
uncertain whether Rhapsody or the planned enhancements to the current 
Mac OS will gain developer support and market acceptance. Inability to 
successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially 
backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to the 
current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market acceptance for 
those operating systems, may have an adverse impact on the 
Company's operating results and financial condition.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is 
characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on 
gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life 
cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance 
characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large 
number of competitors. The Company's results of operations and 
financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, 
adversely affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward 
pressures on gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by 
rapid technological advances in software functionality and hardware 
performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources; broader product 
lines; and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer 
preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features 
over another.







				16
<PAGE> 

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the 
Macintosh operating system ("Mac(registered trademark) OS"). The Mac 
OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, 
which is dominated by makers of computers that run the MS-DOS and 
Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company believes that the 
Mac OS, with its perceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, 
has been a driving force behind sales of the Company's personal 
computer hardware for the past several years. Recent innovations in the 
Windows platform, including those introduced by Windows 95, have 
added features to the Windows platform similar to those offered by the 
Mac OS. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take 
steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the 
Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition may be affected by its ability to maintain and 
increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.  

As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh 
platform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other 
personal computer vendors in January 1995, as well as an additional 
licensing initiative in 1996. Several vendors currently sell products that 
utilize the Macintosh operating system. The Company believes that 
licensing the operating system will result in a broader installed base on 
which software vendors can develop and provide technical innovations 
for the Macintosh platform. However, there can be no assurance that the 
installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the operating 
system or that licensing will result in an increase in the number of 
application software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring to 
market application software based on the Mac OS. In addition, as a 
result of licensing its operating system, the Company competes with 
other companies producing Mac OS-based computer systems. The 
benefits to the Company from licensing the Mac OS to third parties 
may be more than offset by the disadvantages of competing with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS 
and Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward 
developing personal computer products capable of running application 
software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems 
("Cross-Platform Products"). These products include the RISC-based 
PowerPC(trademark) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 
586-class microprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing 
a Pentium or 586-class microprocessor. These products enable users to 
run concurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, 
Windows 3.1, or Windows 95 operating systems. 

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers 
who purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system 
software under licensing agreements with Microsoft. However, in order 
to do so, the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements 
with certain Microsoft distributors.

The Company, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") 
and Motorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of 
specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware reference 
platform. These specifications define a "unified" personal computer 
architecture that gives access to both the Power Macintosh platform and 
the PC environment and utilizes standard industry components. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by its ability to continue to implement this agreement and to 
manage the risk associated with the transition to this new hardware 
reference platform.

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal 
computers, as opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are 
often based on the availability of third-party software for particular 
applications. The Company believes that the availability of third-party 
application software for the Company's hardware products depends in 
part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative 
benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for 
the Company's products versus software for the larger MS-DOS and 
Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived 
strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential 
revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing such 
software products.  To the extent

				17
<PAGE> 

the Company's recent financial losses and declining demand for the 
Company's product have caused software developers to question the 
Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could 
be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing 
software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their 
resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS 
and Windows market. Microsoft Corporation is an important developer 
of application software for the Company's products. Accordingly, 
Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the 
Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its 
interests as the vendor of the Windows operating systems. 

The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is 
also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the 
suppliers of the PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the 
Company's products, to supply to the Company in adequate numbers 
microprocessors that produce superior price/performance results 
compared with those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel 
Corporation, the developer and producer of the microprocessors used by 
most personal computers using the MS-DOS and Windows operating 
systems. IBM produces personal computers based on Intel 
microprocessors as well as workstations based on the PowerPC 
microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing 
operating system to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's 
interest in supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the 
Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its 
interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a 
competing operating system vendor.  

Several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and 
Microsoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target 
certain of the Company's key market segments, including education and 
publishing. Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.

The Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and 
existing hardware and software platforms. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to continue to do so successfully. In 
addition, the Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by 
an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or 
developed products addressing access to, authoring for, or 
communication over, the Internet. Many of these competitors have a 
significant lead over the Company in developing products for the 
Internet, have significantly greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, 
and technological resources than the Company, or both.


Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its 
international operations. As a result, the Company's operations and 
financial results could be significantly affected by international factors, 
such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic 
conditions in the foreign markets in which the Company distributes its 
products. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the 
U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the 
U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based 
sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. 
dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases 
when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net 
receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits 
from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar 
relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in 
exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may 
negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross margins 
(as expressed in U.S. dollars). 


				18
<PAGE> 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange 
rates on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product 
procurement, and operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its 
non-U.S. dollar-based exposures. Specifically, the Company enters into 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge its assets, 
liabilities and firmly committed transactions. Currently, hedges of 
firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year. The 
Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge 
certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions. Hedges of 
probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not extend 
beyond one year. To reduce the costs associated with these ongoing 
foreign exchange hedging programs, the Company also regularly sells 
foreign exchange option contracts and enters into certain other foreign 
exchange transactions. All foreign exchange forward and option 
contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions intended 
to reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange 
hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each 
balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the 
interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the 
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to 
fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, 
changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the 
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well 
as interest paid on its notes payable to banks and long-term debt. To 
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company 
has entered into interest rate swap, collar, and floor transactions. Certain 
of these transactions are intended to better match the Company's 
floating-rate interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments with the fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term 
debt. The Company also enters into these transactions in order to 
diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations 
in short-term U.S. interest rates. These instruments may extend the 
Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum duration of three 
years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign 
exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the 
risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company 
continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, 
and its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-
alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and 
interest rate-related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting 
and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of 
the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance 
that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the 
adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in 
either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the 
accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market 
instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of 
gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, 
therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and 
financial position. The Company generally does not engage in leveraged 
hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition is expected to increase the 
costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of the 
hedging transactions into which the Company's counterparties are 
willing to enter.

Inventory and Supply

The Company provides reserves against any inventories of products that 
have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand, accrues for 
any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled, 
and accrues for the estimated costs to correct any product quality 
problems.  Although the Company believes its inventory and related 
reserves are adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will 
not incur additional inventory and related charges.  In addition, such 
charges have had, and may again have, a material affect on the 
Company's financial position and results of operations.


				19
<PAGE> 

The Company must order components for its products and build 
inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the 
Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and 
price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast incorrectly 
and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. The 
Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the 
past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the 
Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-
term shifts in customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part 
by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of 
the Company or otherwise. As a result of the Company's restructuring 
actions, which include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, 
manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related 
manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, the proportion of the 
Company's products produced and distributed under outsourcing 
arrangements will increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower 
the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the 
Company has over production. It is uncertain what effect such 
diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products 
manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing 
market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage 
its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the 
Company to liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement.  

Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain 
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains 
at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty 
service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty 
liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated 
product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements 
with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be 
limited by the availability of key components. The Company believes 
that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of 
microprocessors and ASICS presents the most significant potential for 
constraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some 
advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up 
for production and thus have limited availability. The Company and 
other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for 
other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced 
increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer 
demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the 
cellular phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses 
some components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). 
Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers 
were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components 
instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. 
Such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could 
decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's 
operating results and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of 
the Company's products. Currently, the Company's primary means of 
distribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers 
include consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer 
electronics outlets, and computer superstores. The Company's business 
and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition 
of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels 
were to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.





20
<PAGE> 

Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause 
resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's 
products. Under the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers 
have the option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, 
in most instances without financial penalty. Resellers also have the 
option to return products to the Company without penalty within 
certain limits, beyond which they may be assessed fees. The Company 
has experienced a reduction in ordering from historical levels by 
resellers due to uncertainty concerning the Company's condition and 
prospects.

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its 
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including 
certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The 
Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially 
adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries 
may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations 
which include, in some instances, the requirement that the Company 
provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at 
the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally 
safe disposal or recycling with the Company. It is unclear what effect 
such regulation will have on the Company's future operating results and 
financial condition.

The Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing 
transaction systems (which include order management, product 
procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated system 
as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency. The 
Company's future operating results and financial condition could be 
adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and 
effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system.  

As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its 
Napa, California, data center to MCI Systemhouse ("MCI"), and entered 
into a data processing outsourcing agreement with MCI. While this 
outsourcing agreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of 
operations, it will also reduce the direct control the Company has over 
its data processing. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control 
will have on the Company's data processing.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial 
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future 
performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate 
results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's 
participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant 
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash 
equivalents, and short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, 
increased to $1,627 million at December 27, 1996, from $1,559 
million at September 27, 1996. The Company's financial position with 
respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased 
to $1,807 million at December 27, 1996, from $1,745 million at 
September 27, 1996. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance 
at December 27, 1996 and September 27, 1996, includes $174 million 
and $177 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters 
of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase 
commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, 
Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI. 

Cash generated by operations during the first quarter of 1997 totaled $94 
million, primarily the result of a decrease in inventories, partially offset 
by the Company's net loss. The Company expects to use cash to fund 
operations over at least the remainder of 1997, if not longer.

				21
<PAGE>

The Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity 
investments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less 
for the remainder of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996. Cash 
used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $20 
million in the first three months of 1997, and consisted primarily of 
increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The Company 
expects that the level of capital expenditures for the remainder of 1997 
will be comparable to the same period of 1996.

In January 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt 
were downgraded to B and CCC+, respectively, by Standard and Poor's 
Rating Agency. The Company was also placed on negative credit watch 
by Moody's Investor Services. These actions may increase the 
Company's cost of funds in future periods. In addition, the Company 
may be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of 
its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to more stringent 
covenants than in the past. 

The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents 
and short-term investments, together with continued short-term 
borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
over the next 12 months. In addition to funding net losses over at least 
the next two quarters, expected cash requirements include, without 
limitation, an estimated $385 million for the acquisition of NeXT, an 
estimated $59 million to complete the remaining actions under the 
1996 restructuring plan, and an as yet unquantified amount for the 
actions under the expected 1997 supplemental restructuring plan. No 
assurance can be given that short-term borrowings from banks can be 
continued, or that any additional required financing could be obtained 
should the restructuring plans take longer to implement than anticipated 
or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, 
its liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition would be 
materially adversely affected. 

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has 
made certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the 
proposed deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the 
issues in dispute for these years have been resolved. On June 29, 1995, 
the IRS issued a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount 
of the Company's federal income taxes for the years 1989 through 
1991. The Company has filed a petition with the United States Tax 
Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies. Management believes 
that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from these tax examinations.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 45 of the Company's 1996 Annual Report on 
Form 10-K under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain 
purported shareholder class action suits, certain consumer class actions 
relating to monitor-size advertising, and "repetitive stress injury" 
claims.

In December 1996, the Company filed a demurrer to the first amended 
complaint in the case styled Derek Pritchard v. Michael Spindler et al., 
and in January 1997 filed a demurrer to the complaint in the action 
entitled LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Fund v. Michael 
Spindler et al. 

The Company has various other claims, lawsuits, disputes with third 
parties, investigations and pending actions involving allegations of 
false or misleading advertising, product defects, discrimination, 
infringement of intellectual property rights, and breach of contract and 
other matters against the Company  and its subsidiaries incident to the 
operation of its business. The liability, if any, associated with these 
matters was not determinable as of the date of this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the matters cited above will 
not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported 
in the accompanying financial statements. However, depending on the 
amount and timing of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is 
possible that the Company's future results of operations or cash flows 
could be materially affected in a particular period.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

		AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of

Vice President and General Counsel of the Company and shall report 
directly to me and your duties and responsibilities to the Company shall 
be consistent in all respects with such position. You shall devote 
substantially all of your business time, attention, skills and efforts 
exclusively to the business and affairs of the Company, other than de 
minimis  amounts of time devoted by you to the management of your 
personal finances or to engaging in charitable or community services. 
Your principal place of employment shall be the executive offices of

services rendered to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company 
will pay you a base salary at the rate of not less than three hundred 
sixty thousand dollars ($360,000) per annum as of the Effective Date. 
Your base salary will be paid to you in accordance with the Company's 
regular payroll practices applicable to its executive employees.

		(b)	Bonus.  You shall be eligible to participate 
in the annual Senior Executive Bonus Plan (domestic) sponsored by the 
Company or any successor plan thereto. Such bonus program shall 
afford you the opportunity to earn an annual bonus for each fiscal year

Fiscal Year 1997 only, your Target Annual Bonus shall be 67% of your 
Base Compensation, or two hundred forty one thousand, two hundred 
dollars ($241,200) prorated for that portion of the Company's Fiscal 
Year 1997 during

thereafter, expressed as a percentage of your Base Compensation, shall 
be reviewed annually by the Company but shall not be less than 67%

Company's Chief Executive Officer, which demand specifically 
identifies the manner in which the Company believes that you have not 
substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not 
substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such demand.

waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing.  No waiver by 
either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto 
of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement 
to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar 
or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or 
subsequent time.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, 
express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been 
made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this 
Agreement and this Agreement shall supersede all prior agreements, 
negotiations, correspondence, undertakings and communications of the 
parties, oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
