APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the 
Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim
results have been included.  All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature 
unless specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.  The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.  These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 29, 1995, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended September 29, 1995 (the "1995 Form 10-K").

2.	In the third quarter of 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate
principal amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") 
to certain qualified parties in a private placement.  The Notes were sold at 
100% of par.  The Notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001.  
The Notes are convertible by their holders at any time after September 5, 1996 
at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to adjustments as defined in 
the Note agreement.  The Notes are redeemable by the Company at 102.4% of the 
principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 12-month period beginning June 
1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 
12-month period beginning June 1, 2000.  The Notes are subordinated to all 
present and future senior indebtedness of the Company as defined in the Note 
agreement.  In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million of 
costs associated with the issuance of the Notes.  These costs are accounted for
as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and will be amortized over the 
life of the Notes.   

3.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations.  The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the Company's 
adoption of a new strategic direction.  The Company's restructuring actions 
consist primarily of terminating approximately 2,800 full-time employees (not 
including employees who were hired by SCI Systems, Inc., the purchaser of the 
Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility), canceling or vacating 
certain facility leases as a result of these employee terminations, writing 
down operating assets to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and 
outsourcing various operational functions, and canceling contracts as a result 
of terminating eWorld(trademark), Apple's on-line service.  These actions have
resulted in a charge of $207 million, including cash expenditures of $44 
million and non-cash asset write-downs of $4 million, through the third 
quarter.  The Company expects that the remaining $159 million accrued balance 
at June 28, 1996 will result in cash expenditures of $103 million over the next 
12 months and $12 million thereafter.  The Company expects that most of the 
contemplated restructuring actions will be completed within the next twelve 
months and will be financed through current working capital and continued 
short-term borrowings.  In addition, in connection with the sale of its 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility, the Company is obligated to purchase 
certain percentages of its total annual volumes of CPUs and logic boards from 
SCI Systems, Inc. over each of the next three years.   The Company believes 
that it 
will meet these obligations.


The following table depicts the restructuring activity through the third 
quarter of 1996:  (In millions)

5.	The Company's cash equivalents consist primarily of U.S. Government 
securities, Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper with maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term investments consisted 
principally of Euro-dollar deposits and commercial paper with maturities 
between three and twelve months.  The Company's marketable equity securities 
consist of securities issued by U.S. corporations and are included in "Other 
assets" on the accompanying balance sheet.  The Company's cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, and marketable equity securities are classified and 
accounted for as available-for-sale,  and the cash equivalents and short-term 
investments are generally held until maturity.   The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balance includes $173 million pledged as collateral to support 
letters of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments 
under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing 
facility to SCI Systems, Inc.
	
	The adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding 
gains (losses) on available-for-sale cash equivalents and marketable equity 
securities were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, at June 
28, 1996.  The gross realized gains recorded to earnings on sales of available-
for-sale securities were $69 million and $71 million for the three and nine 
months ended June 28, 1996, respectively.

6.	U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $395 
million of undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign 
subsidiaries.  It is intended that these earnings will be indefinitely invested 
in operations outside of the United States.  It is not practicable to determine 
the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be 
distributed.  Except for such indefinitely invested earnings, the Company 
provides for federal and state income taxes currently on undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries. 

	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies for the 
years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these years have 
been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency 
proposing increases in the amount of the Company's federal income taxes for the 
years 1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a petition with the United 
States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management 
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from these tax examinations. 

7.	Earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of 
common and dilutive common equivalent shares attributable to stock options 
outstanding during the period.  Loss per share is computed using the weighted 
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

8.	Certain prior year amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows

retain any earnings for use in the operation of its business.

Overview

Over the last six months the Company has experienced a significant decline in 
net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer market.  For the 
quarter ended June 28, 1996, the number of the Company's Macintosh computers 
shipped worldwide declined by 16% when compared with  the corresponding quarter
of 1995.  Moreover, according to an industry source, in the third quarter of 
1996 as compared to  the third quarter of 1995, the Company's share of the 
worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.3% from 7.4%, and to
7.4% from 10.6%, respectively.  This decline in demand, coupled with intense 
price competition throughout the industry, has resulted in the Company's 
decision to develop and announce key elements of a new strategic direction 
intended to improve the Company's competitiveness and restore its 
profitability.  The Company intends to develop and market products and services
more selectively targeted to education, home and business segments.  In moving 
in this new strategic direction, the Company expects to reduce the number of 
new product introductions and the number of products in certain categories 
within its current product portfolio.

Net Sales

Net sales for the third quarter of 1996 decreased when compared with the 
corresponding quarter of 1995, resulting from a decrease in Macintosh
(registered trademark) computer net sales and in net sales of peripheral 
products such as displays and printers.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales 
decreased 16% in the third quarter when compared with the corresponding 
quarter of 1995, primarily as a result of a decline in worldwide demand for 
most product families, primarily entry level products, due principally to 
customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial 
condition and future prospects, and as a result of delays in the shipment of 
certain Powerbook products due to quality problems.  The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit decreased 8% in the third quarter when 
compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995, primarily due to pricing 
actions across all product lines in order to stimulate demand, partially 
offset by increased revenues from a shift in the mix towards the Company's 
newer products and products with multi-media configurations, which have higher 
average selling prices.

Net sales for the first nine months of 1996 decreased when compared with the 
first nine months of 1995, resulting from a decrease in Macintosh computer net 
sales and in net sales of peripheral products such as displays and printers.  
Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 5% in the first nine months of 
1996, when compared with the corresponding period of 1995.  Unit sales 
increased in the first quarter of 1996 when compared with the corresponding 
quarter of 1995, but were more than offset by unit sales decreases in the 
second and third quarters of 1996 when compared with the corresponding quarters
of 1995.  The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit did not 
change in the first nine months of 1996, when compared with the corresponding 
period of 1995 primarily due to increased revenues from a shift in the mix 
towards the Company's newer products and products with multi-media 
configurations, which have higher average selling prices, offset by pricing 
actions across all product lines in order to stimulate demand.

International net sales decreased 9% in the third quarter and did not change 
in the first nine months of 1996, respectively, when compared with the 
corresponding periods of 1995. The decrease in the third quarter was 
attributable to a decrease in net sales in Europe due to a decrease in total 
Macintosh computer unit sales, partially offset by higher average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit.  The decrease in the third quarter was 
also attributable to a decrease in net sales in Japan due to a decrease in the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit, partially offset by an 
increase in total Macintosh computer unit sales.  The flat net sales in the 
first nine months primarily reflects strong net sales growth in Japan and 
certain countries within Europe during the first quarter of 1996, offset by 
decreases in net sales in the second and third quarters.  International net 
sales represented 52% and 53% of total net sales for the third quarter and 
first nine months of 1996, respectively, compared with 49% and 50% for the 
corresponding periods of 1995.  Domestic net sales decreased by approximately 
21% and 13% in the third quarter and first nine months of 1996, respectively, 
when compared with the corresponding periods of 1995.

The Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis.  
Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on 
changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ("backlog") can be, and often are,
canceled at will.  The Company attempts to fill orders on the requested 
delivery schedules.  The Company's backlog increased to approximately $468 
million at August 2, 1996, from approximately $369 million at May  3, 1996.  
This increase in backlog is primarily the result of an increase in orders due 
to certain new product introductions.  The Company estimates that product 
backlog would have been approximately $430 million at August 2, 1996 if certain
quality problems with certain Powerbook products had not occurred.

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any 
particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its future 
business prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of 
or immediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering 
by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply once 
dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.  Because of 
the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog, 
backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability 
to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will remain below prior years levels 
through at least the first quarter of 1997.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and its 
cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale of products is
influenced in significant part by the price set by the Company for its products
relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based primarily on 
the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs.   Because 
the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the 
personal computer industry (including certain ASICs), its component costs may 
be higher than those incurred by other manufacturers.  The type and cost of 
components included in particular configurations of the Company's products 
(such as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to 
market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers.  
Competition in the personal computer industry is intense, and, in the short 
term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary
in order to remain competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of 
net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by actions 
undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide competitive pressures.

Gross margin decreased to 18.5% and 6.1% during the third quarter and first 
nine months of 1996, respectively, when compared with the corresponding periods
of 1995. The decrease in the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the 
corresponding quarter of 1995 is due to the Company's response to extreme 
competitive actions by other companies attempting to gain market share, which 
included pricing actions in the U.S., Japan and Europe across most product 
lines, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain product 
components. The decrease in gross margin in the first nine months of 1996 as 
compared with the first nine months of 1995 is primarily a result of a $616 
million charge in the second quarter of 1996 principally for the write-down of 
certain inventory, as well as the cost to cancel excess component orders, 
necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the 
Company's products, primarily its entry level products.  Also, the Company 
separately incurred $77 million in charges in the second and third quarters 
that reflect the estimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain 
entry level, Performa and Powerbook products, covering both goods held in 
inventory and shipped goods.  In addition, gross margins were adversely 
affected by aggressive pricing actions in Japan, particularly severe in the 
first quarter of 1996, in response to extreme competitive actions by other 
companies attempting to gain market share, and pricing actions in the U.S. and 
Europe across all product lines in order to stimulate demand.

The decrease in gross margin levels in the third quarter and first nine months 
of 1996 compared with the corresponding periods of 1995 was slightly offset by 
hedging gains less the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain 
foreign currencies.  The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into 
account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of 
operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates.  

Although the Company is taking actions to improve gross margins as it 
implements its new strategic plan, it is anticipated that gross margins will 
continue to remain under pressure due to a variety of factors, including 
continued industrywide pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed 
product life cycles, and the need to sell through current inventory at prices 
reflecting the recent write-downs.

Research and development expenditures for the third quarter of 1996 decreased 
when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 as a result of the 
termination of certain third party joint development efforts.  The increase in
the first nine months is primarily due to higher project and headcount related 
spending in the first six months of 1996 as compared to the first six months of
1995, partially offset by a decrease in certain research and development 
expenditures in the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the third quarter of 
1995 as previously discussed.  The increase as a percentage of net sales in the
third quarter of 1996 when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 was 
a result of the decrease in the level of net sales.

<PAGE>


As part of the Company's restructuring plan and new strategic direction, the 
Company expects to reduce the number of employees engaged in research and 
development activities and to streamline its product offerings.  As a result, 
the Company expects that research and development expenditures will decrease 
relative to historical levels after significant portions of the restructuring 
plan have been completed.  Nevertheless, the Company believes that continued 
investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and 
competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to continued, 
timely development of new and enhanced products.  The Company believes a 
greater portion of its research and development efforts will be conducted 
through collaborations with third parties.  In addition, where appropriate the
Company plans to acquire and license technologies from third parties.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and
remained essentially flat in the first nine months of 1996 when compared with
the corresponding periods of 1995. The decrease in the third quarter of 1996 
as compared with the same quarter of 1995 was primarily due to reduced 
advertising expenditures, while for the first nine months of 1996 as compared 
with the first nine months of 1995 the spending related to marketing and 
advertising programs was unchanged.  The increase as a percentage of net sales 
in the third quarter when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 was 
primarily a result of the reduced overall level of net sales.

As a result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that selling, 
general and administrative expenditures will decrease relative to historical 
levels.

In the first and third quarters of 1995, the Company lowered its estimates of 
the total remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan initiated in 
the third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased income by 
$17 million and $6 million, respectively.

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased in the third quarter and 
increased from expense to income in the first nine months of 1996 when compared
to the corresponding periods in 1995, primarily due to realized gains on sales 
of available-for-sale securities of $69 million in the third quarter of 1996, 
and favorable variances related to realized and unrealized foreign exchange 
hedging gains (losses) as a result of less volatility in the foreign exchange 
markets in the second quarter of 1996 as compared to the second quarter of 
1995, offset by unfavorable variances in interest income related primarily to 
lower average cash balances and lower interest earnings rates.  The Company's 
cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading from January 1996 
through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C by Moody's Investor 
Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively, and of its long-
term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's 
Rating Agency, respectively.

The Company's balance sheet at June 28, 1996, contains a total deferred tax 
asset of $401 million. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based 
on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. Realization of 
approximately $100 million of the asset is dependent upon the Company's ability
to generate approximately $285 million of future U.S. taxable income. 
Management believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will be 
realized based upon forecasted income.  However, there can be no assurance that 
the Company will meet its expectations of future income.  The Company will 
continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by 
assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent on
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the Company 
must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results 
and financial condition.  Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect 
the Company's future operating results and financial condition include, without
limitation: continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the effect any 
reaction to such competitive pressures has on inventory levels and inventory 
valuations; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of successful technological innovations; the effects of significant
adverse publicity; the Company's ability to supply product in certain 
categories; the impact of uncertainties concerning the Company's strategic 
direction and financial condition on revenue and liquidity; the effect of 
degradation in the Company's liquidity; and the effect of restructuring 
actions.

The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses throughout at least 
the remainder of 1996, if not longer.

Restructuring of Operations

In the second quarter of 1996, the Company formulated a new strategic direction
and announced certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost 
structure, improving its competitiveness and restoring profitability.  There 
are several risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost
structure.  These include the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce 
expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability and the risk that cost-
cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and remain 
competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has begun to implement a new 
business model.  Implementation of the new business model involves several 
risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the Company will
increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce overall sales and 
increase its reliance on unproven products and technology.  Another risk of the 
new business model is that by increasing the proportion of the Company's 
products to be produced under outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose 
control of the quality of the products manufactured and lose the flexibility to
make timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing 
market conditions.  In addition, the new business model could adversely affect 
employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and motivate 
employees.  Also, because the new business model contemplates that the Company 
will reduce its research and development expenditures by, among other things, 
relying to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with 
third parties, the Company will have less direct control over its research and 
development efforts and its ability to create innovative new products may be 
reduced.  Finally, even if the new business model is successfully implemented, 
there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the various issues 
currently facing the Company.  In addition, although the Company believes that 
the action that it is taking under its restructuring plan should help restore 
marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can be no assurance 
that such actions will succeed.

For the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the current 
restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will not 
be required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty 
in effectively managing the transition to the new business model and cost 
structure.

For more information regarding the Company's restructuring actions initiated 
in the second quarter of 1996, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to Liquidity and 
Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, 
which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is 
characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological 
advances, the Company frequently introduces new products and product 
enhancements.  The success of new product introductions is dependent on a 
number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage
the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application 
software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line 
with anticipated product demand, the manufacturing of products in appropriate 
quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have 
quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.  Accordingly, the 
Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its 
sales or results of operations.  In addition, the uncertainties and risks 
associated with new product introductions may be increased as a result of the 
Company's new business model which will, in part, emphasize a refocusing of 
product offerings and the introduction of new products for key growth segments.

					14
<PAGE>


The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new 
product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for 
that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not under the 
control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large purchases by a
small segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology 
prior to its acceptance by the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases 
in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology and, 
as a result, deferred purchases of other products; and over-ordering by dealers
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors.  The preceding may 
also be offset by other factors, such as the deferral of purchases by many 
users until new technology is accepted as "proven" and for which commonly used 
software products are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once 
they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in 
backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasingly coincident with introduction,
and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain 
sufficient supply of products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further complicated 
by the availability of different product configurations, which may include 
various types of built-in peripherals and software.  Configurations may also 
require certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, as a 
result, demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the 
availability of third-party software in those localized versions.  For example,
the availability of European-language versions of software products 
manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions
by a quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's 
new products outside the United States, even though localized versions of the 
Company's products may be available.

The greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of the 
Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults 
could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products have 
been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant, the Company could 
incur material recall and replacement costs under product warranties.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by 
aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent 
introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement 
in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers and a large number of competitors.  In the first nine months of 1996,
the Company's results of operations and financial condition were, and in the 
near future are expected to be, adversely affected by industrywide pricing 
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The industry has also been 
characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality and 
hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards.  Some of the Company's competitors have greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing and technological resources, broader product lines 
and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be affected
by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for 
one platform over another or one set of product features over another.

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Macintosh 
operating system ("Mac OS").  The Mac OS has a minority market share in the 
personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers that run 
the MS-DOS(registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows(trademark) operating 
systems.  The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived advantages 
over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving force behind sales of the Company's 
personal computer hardware for the past several years.  Recent innovations in 
the Windows platform, including those introduced by Windows 95, have added 
features to the Windows platform similar to those offered by the Mac OS.  The 
Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the 
competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result 
of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.  The Company's future 
operating results and financial condition may be affected by its ability to 
increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.  The Company recently 
announced a new strategy with respect to updating its operating system.  Rather
than introduce a comprehensive new operating system in a single release, the 
Company intends to issue periodic releases consisting of discrete operating 
system components.  The Company expects that this will enable it to introduce 
some new functionality for the operating system sooner than it would be able to
introduce a complete new operating system.  As part of its efforts to increase 
the installed base for the Macintosh platform, the Company announced the 
licensing of the Mac OS to other personal computer vendors in January 1995, 
and several vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh 
operating system.  The Company believes that licensing the operating system 
will result in a broader installed base on which software vendors can develop 
and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  However, there 
can be no assurance that the installed base will be broadened by the licensing 
of the operating system or that licensing will result in an increase in the 
number of application software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring 
to market application software based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as a result
of licensing its operating system, the Company is forced to compete with other 
companies producing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits to the Company 
from licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than offset by the 
disadvantages of being required to compete with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS and Windows, 
the Company has devoted substantial resources toward developing personal 
computer products capable of running application software designed for the 
MS-DOS or Windows operating systems ("Cross-Platform Products"). These products
include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601 microprocessor and the 486 DX2/66 
microprocessor, which enable users to run concurrently applications that 
require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 operating systems.  
During the third quarter of 1996 the Company began shipment of Cross-Platform
Products that include the Pentium or 586-class chip, or in which a Pentium or 
586-class microprocessor can be installed through the use of an add-on card.

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who purchase 
Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system software under licensing 
agreements with Microsoft.  However, in order to do so, the Company will need 
to enter into one or more agreements with certain Microsoft distributors.

On November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with International 
Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware 
reference platform for the PowerPC microprocessor that is intended to deliver 
a much wider range of operating system and application choices for computer 
customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company is moving forward with 
its efforts to make the Macintosh operating system available on the common 
platform.  In line with its efforts, on November 13, 1995, the Company, IBM, 
and Motorola, Inc. announced the availability of the "PowerPC Platform" 
specifications, which define a "unified" personal computer architecture in 
order to give access to both the Power Macintosh platform and the PC 
environment.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition 
may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this agreement and 
to manage the risk associated with the transition to this new hardware 
reference platform. 

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed 
to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of 
third-party software for particular applications.  The Company believes that 
the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware
products depends in part on the third-party developers' perception and analysis
of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software
for the Company's products versus software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows 
market.  This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of 
the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be 
earned, and the costs of developing such software products.  To the extent the 
Company's recent financial losses have caused software developers to question 
the Company's position in the personal computer market, they could be less 
inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for 
the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources toward 
developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  
Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of application software for the
Company's products.  Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application 
software for the Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception 
of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating systems. 

					16
<PAGE>


The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also 
dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of the 
PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to continue 
to supply to the Company microprocessors that produce superior price/
performance results compared with those supplied to the Company's competitors 
by Intel Corporation, the developer and producer of the microprocessors used by
most personal computers using the MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.  IBM 
produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as well as 
workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of 
OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's 
interest in supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the Company's 
products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a competing 
manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.  

Recently, several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM and 
Microsoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain 
of the Company's key market segments, including education and publishing.  Some
of these companies have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and 
technological resources than the Company.

The Company intends to integrate Internet capabilities into its new and 
existing hardware and software platforms.  There can be no assurance that the 
Company will be able to successfully integrate Internet capabilities into its 
products.  In addition, the Internet market is rapidly evolving and is 
characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced 
or developed products addressing access to, or authoring or communication over, 
the Internet.  Some of these competitors have a significant lead over the 
Company in developing products for the Internet or have significantly greater 
financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological resources than the 
Company, or both.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also be 
affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize on its 
investments in other markets, such as the markets for personal digital 
assistant (PDA) products. 


Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international 
operations.  As a result, the Company's operations and financial results could 
be significantly affected by international factors, such as changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in 
which the Company distributes its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens 
against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales 
decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. 
dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-
U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases 
when the U.S. dollar strengthens.  Overall, the Company is a net receiver of 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker 
dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major 
currencies worldwide.  Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in 
particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the 
Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on 
the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and operating 
expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based exposures.  
Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option 
contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.  Currently, hedges of firmly 
committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The Company also 
purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain other probable, 
but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable, but not firmly 
committed transactions currently do not extend beyond one year.  To reduce the 
costs associated with these ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the 
Company also regularly sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into 
certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and 
option contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions 
intended to reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange 
hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each balance 
sheet date for changes in exchange rates.

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest rates 
of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest 
income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of 
U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the 
interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term 
investments as well as interest paid on its short-term borrowings and long-term 
debt.  To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the 
Company has entered into interest rate swap and option transactions.  Certain 
of these swaps are intended to better match the Company's floating-rate 
interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with 
the fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters
into interest rate swap and option transactions in order to diversify a portion
of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest 
rates.  These instruments may extend the Company's cash investment horizon up 
to a maximum duration of three years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and 
interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and 
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its 
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and 
option positions on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying 
foreign currency- and interest rate-related exposures, respectively, from both 
an accounting and an economic perspective.  However, given the effective 
horizons of the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance 
that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse 
financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign 
exchange or interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for 
recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any 
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to 
the underlying economic exposures, and as such, may adversely affect the 
Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company generally does
not engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the costs of 
its hedging transactions, as well as the willingness of its trading partners to
enter into hedging transactions with the Company.

Inventory and Supply

In line with the Company's efforts to redesign its business model, the Company 
intends to streamline its product offerings in its key usage areas in 
education, business and the home.  This simplification of product lines has 
resulted in inventory reserves.   Cancellation fees related to custom component 
inventory purchased for anticipated product introductions that have been 
canceled have also been paid or incurred.  The Company has also separately 
provided for the estimated cost to correct certain quality problems on certain 
entry level, Performa and Powerbook products.  Although the Company believes 
its inventory and related reserves are adequate, no assurance can be given that 
the Company will not incur additional inventory charges.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory well in 
advance of product shipments.  Because the Company's markets are volatile and 
subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk that the Company
will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of 
particular products.  The Company's operating results and financial condition 
have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the 
Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term 
shifts in customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by 
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the 
Company or otherwise.  As a result of the Company's restructuring plan, which 
includes the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility to
SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related manufacturing outsourcing agreement 
with SCI, the proportion of the Company's products produced under outsourcing 
arrangements will increase.  While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed 
cost of operations, they may also reduce the direct control the Company has 
over production.  It is uncertain what effect such lessened control will have 
on the quality of the products manufactured or the flexibility of the Company 
to respond to changing market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the 
Company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject 
the Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement.  

Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions 
for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially 
responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service.  Accordingly, in the 
event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain 
primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, 
whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, 
could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial 
condition.
					18
<PAGE>

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited by the 
availability of key components.  The Company believes that the availability 
from suppliers to the personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs 
presents the most significant potential for constraining the Company's ability 
to produce products.  Specific microprocessors manufactured by Motorola, Inc. 
and IBM are currently available only from single sources, while some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and 
thus have limited availability.  The Company and other producers in the 
personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with 
other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due 
to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their 
products (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries).  Finally, the 
Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain ASICs).  Continued availability of these 
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the 
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the 
Company's requirements.  Such product supply constraints and corresponding 
increased costs could decrease the Company's market share and adversely affect 
the Company's future operating results and financial condition.  


Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the 
Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of distribution is 
through third-party computer resellers.  The Company also distributes product 
through consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer electronics 
outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business and financial 
results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these 
resellers weakens or if resellers within consumer channels decide not to 
continue to distribute the Company's products.

Uncertainty over the demand for the Company's products may cause resellers to 
reduce the ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under the 
Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to reduce 
or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances without 
financial penalty.  Resellers also have the option to return products to the 
Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they may be 
assessed fees.  In the third quarter of 1996, the Company experienced a 
reduction in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty 
concerning the Company's condition. 

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its 
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are located near 
major seismic faults. The Company's operating results and financial condition 
could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may 
subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, in 
some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the 
ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and 
leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the 
Company.  It is unclear what the effect of such regulation will have on the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing transaction 
systems (which include order management, distribution, and finance) with a 
single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational 
efficiency.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition 
could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and 
effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system.  

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance 
should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in 
future periods.  In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic 
industry often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock 
price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings, increased to $1,172 
million at June 28, 1996, from $491 million at September 29, 1995.  The 
Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments increased to $1,359 million at June 28, 1996, from $952 
million at September 29, 1995.    The Company's cash and cash equivalent 
balance includes $173 million pledged as collateral to support letters of 
credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the 
terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility to
SCI Systems, Inc., and at September 29, 1995 includes $90 million pledged as 
collateral to support short-term borrowings. 

Cash generated by operations during the first nine months of 1996 totaled $112 
million.  Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in
accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in accounts
payable.  Cash generated during the first nine months of 1996 from the sale of 
certain equity investments and the sale of the Fountain manufacturing facility 
to SCI Systems, Inc. totaled $120 million.  

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $55 
million in the first nine months of 1996, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing machinery and equipment.  The Company expects that capital 
expenditures in 1996 will remain below 1995 levels.

Short-term borrowings at June 28, 1996, were approximately $274 million lower 
than at September 29, 1995.  During the third quarter, an outstanding loan to 
Apple Computer B.V., a subsidiary of the Company, in the amount of $200 
million was repaid in full.  At June 28, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary 
of the Company, held $187 million of short-term borrowings from several banks, 
with maturity dates ranging from September 1996 to December 1996.  The majority 
of these loans are guaranteed by the Company.

The Company's balance of long-term debt increased during the first nine months 
of 1996 due to the issuance of $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% 
unsecured convertible subordinated notes to certain qualified parties in a 
private placement.  These notes were sold at 100% of par.  These notes pay 
interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001. For more information 
regarding the Company's unsecured convertible subordinated notes, refer to Note
2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item
I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is hereby 
incorporated by reference.  The remainder of long-term borrowings consists of 
$300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes issued under an 
omnibus shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1994.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective 
yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on 
February 15, 2004.  

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for 
the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments 
thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies for the years 1984 
through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these years have been 
resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency proposing 
increases to the amount of the Company's federal income taxes for the years 
1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a petition with the United States Tax 
Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these
tax examinations. 

As noted on page 13 under the subheading "Interest and other income (expense), 
net",  the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading 
from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C by 
Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively, 
and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor Services and 
Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In addition, the Company may 
be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its 
borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than 
in the past.  The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash 
equivalents, together with continued short-term borrowings and the sale of 
certain assets and other investments, will be sufficient to meet its operating 
cash requirements, including the impact of planned restructuring actions, on a 
short- and long-term basis.  No assurance can be given that short-term 
borrowings can be continued, or that any additional financing that may be 
required if the restructuring plan takes longer to implement than anticipated 
or is not successful can be obtained.  If the Company is unable to obtain such 
financing, its liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be
materially adversely affected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Reference is made to Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 29, 1996 for a discussion of 
certain purported shareholder class action suits filed in January 1996 and 
March 1996.  In August 1996, the Company's demurrer to the complaint in the 
action styled Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp, et al. was 
sustained on a variety of grounds.  The court granted the plaintiffs sixty 
days to amend their complaint.  In June 1996, a purported class action 
complaint naming the Company and certain current and former officers, directors
and employees was filed in the California Superior Court for Alameda County, 
styled as LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Plan v. Spindler, et al., 
No. CV 767971.  The complaint, which seeks damages, generally alleges that the 
defendants misrepresented or omitted material facts about the Company's 
operations and financial results which plaintiff contends artificially inflated
the Company's stock price.  None of the defendants has yet responded to the 
complaint.

The Company has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits (fewer than 100)
in each of which the complaint alleges that the plaintiff incurred so-called 
"repetitive stress injuries" to the upper extremities as a result of using 
keyboards and/or mouse input devices sold by the Company.  All of these cases 
are in various stages of pre-trial activity.  These suits are similar to those 
filed against other major suppliers of personal computers.  Ultimate resolution 
of the litigation against the Company may depend on progress in resolving this 
type of litigation in the industry overall.

In August 1995, the Company was named, along with forty-one other entities, 
including computer manufacturers and computer monitor vendors, in a putative 
nationwide class action filed in the California Superior Court for Orange 
County, styled Keith Long, et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp., et al.  The 
complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or misleading 
advertising with respect to the size of computer monitor screens.  Also in
August 1995, the Company was named as the sole defendant in a purported class 
action alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for 
Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. Apple Computer, Inc.  Subsequently, 
in November 1995, the Company, along with 26 other entities, was named in a 
purported class action alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior
Court for Essex County, entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple Computer, Inc., et 
al.  Similar punative class actions have been filed in other California 
counties in which the Company was not named as a defendant.  The complaints in 
all of these cases seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, 
damages, punitive damages and attorneys fees.  In December 1995, the California
Judicial Council ordered all of the California actions, including Long, 
coordinated for purposes of pre-trial proceedings and trial before a single 
judge, the Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San Francisco.  
All of the California actions were subsequently coordinated under the name In 
re Computer Monitor Litigation and a master consolidated complaint filed 
superseding all of the individual complaints in those actions.  On July 3, 
1996, Judge Cahill ordered all of the California cases dismissed without leave 
to amend as to plaintiffs residing in California on the ground that a 
stipulated judgment entered in September 1995 in a prior action brought by the 
California Attorney General alleging the same cause of action was res judicata 
as to the plaintiffs in the consolidated California class action suits.  Both 
the New Jersey cases and the consolidated California cases are at a preliminary
stage, with no discovery having taken place.

The Company has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of false or misleading 
advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement of intellectual 
property rights, and breach of contract and other matters against the Company  
and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its business.  The liability,
if any, associated with these matters was not determinable as of the date of 
this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the actions cited above will not have a 
material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements.  However, depending on the amount and timing
of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the 
Company's future results of operations or cash flows could be materially 
affected in a particular period.

Mr. Robert M. Calderoni
19670 Scotland Road
Saratoga, California 95070


Employment Agreement


Dear Mr. Calderoni:

		The following sets forth our agreement regarding the terms anD
provisions of your employment as an officer and employee of Apple Computer, 
Inc. (the" Company"). Capitalized words which are not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to such words in Section 6 of this Agreement.

		1.  Commencement of Employment. Your employment under this 
Agreement shall commence on July 8, 1996 (the "Effective Date").

		2. Position.  You shall be employed as Senior Vice President, 
Finance and Operations Controller of the Company and shall report directly to
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and your duties and 
responsibilities to the Company shall be consistent in all respects with such
position.  You shall devote substantially all of your business time, attention,
skills and efforts exclusively to the business and affairs of the Company, 
other than de minimis  amounts of time devoted by you to the management of your
personal finances or to engaging in charitable or community services.  Your 
principal place of employment shall be the executive offices of the Company in
Cupertino, California, although you understand and agree that you will be 
required to travel from time to time for business purposes. 

		3.  Compensation.

		(a)  Base Salary.  As compensation to you for all services 
rendered to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company will pay you a base
salary at the rate of not less than two hundred seventy five thousand dollars
($275,000) per annum as of the Effective Date. Your base salary will be paid
to you in accordance with the Company's regular payroll practices applicable
to its executive employees.
					25
<PAGE>


		(b)  Bonus.  You shall be eligible to participate in the annual
Senior Executive Bonus Plan (domestic) sponsored by the Company or any successor
plan thereto.  Such bonus program shall afford you the opportunity to earn an 
annual bonus for each fiscal year of the Company during your employment.  
During the remainder of the Company's Fiscal Year 1996 only, you shall be 
guaranteed a bonus payout at the end of Q4 in the amount of thirty five 
thousand dollars ($35,000).  During the Company's Fiscal Year 1997 only, your

thereafter shall be reviewed annually by the Company.  Subject to the provision
above regarding a guaranteed bonus payout during the Company's Fiscal Year 1996
and 1997, each annual bonus shall be paid to you in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the bonus plan then in effect.

		(e)  Benefits. You shall be eligible to participate in all 
employee benefit plans and arrangements that the Company provides to its

					26
<PAGE>


		4.  Termination.

		(a)  Termination for Cause.  If your employment is terminated
by the Company for Cause, the Company shall pay you the full amount of the 
accrued but unpaid base salary you have earned through the date of your 
termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of your base salary
then in effect) for all unused accrued vacation.  In addition, you shall be 
entitled to benefits under the employee plans and arrangements described in 
Section 3(e) above in accordance with terms and provisions of such plans and
arrangements.

	(b)  Termination Other than for Cause.  During the first twelve (12)
months following the Effective Date only, if your employment is terminated by
the Company for reasons other than for Cause, the Company shall pay you the 
full amount of the accrued but unpaid base salary you have earned through the 
date of your termination.  In addition, you shall be eligible for participation
in Apple's Executive Severance Plan ("ESP").  Under the current terms and 
conditions of the ESP, you would remain an active employee, receiving full 
salary and benefits, for a period up to ninety (90) days after your date of 
termination, and be eligible to receive a severance benefit equal to four (4) 
month's pay.  In addition, you will be entitled to receive the following 
amounts: 

	50% of FY 97 target bonus
	as guaranteed ($75,000)

	or

	The actual prorated bonus amount
	payable under the ESP
					
There shall be no other payments or benefits on termination during the first 
twelve (12) months following the Effective Date.

	(c)  Although the terms and conditions of the ESP would govern your 
participation, the following highlights some of the material terms and 
conditions in the event of a Change in Control, as defined in and provided for
under the June 9, 1995 Supplement to the ESP:

COVERAGE:  Employees of the Company who are otherwise Eligible Employees under
	   the Executive Severance Plan, other than those who have employment 
	   or retention agreements.



TERM:	   The Supplement is effective for two years, beginning on the Change 
	   in Control Date.  Change in Control Date generally means the date
	   of the Change in Control or the date of the approval of an agreement
	   which will result in a Change in Control.
					
					27
<PAGE>

SEVERANCE: The Supplement to the Executive Severance Plan provides for the 
	   following enhanced severance benefits:

	   -The regular severance payment schedule for such employees is 
	   doubled, with a minimum of 8 months of severance and a maximum of 
	   24 months.

	   -The regular benefit continuation period is also doubled.

	   -Employees who are terminated in the two-year period following the
	   Change in Control Date receive a special bonus equal to 1 times 
	   target bonus in lieu of the prorated bonus provided under the normal
	   plan provisions.

	   -Employees can resign for "Good Reason" and collect the foregoing 
	   amounts if their principal place of employment is relocated to a 
	   location which is more than 50 miles from their current place of 
	   employment or if their job duties are significantly changed 
	   (i.e., a drop of two grade levels or a required pay reduction).

	   Severance payments are contingent upon the signing a release in 
	   favor of the Company in substantially the form of the release 
	   contemplated under the current terms of the Executive Severance 
	   Plan.

GROSS-UP:  All payments and benefits to eligible employees are "grossed-up" to
	   eliminate the effects of the 20% excise tax under the "golden 
	   parachute" rules.  These gross-up provisions are intended to place 
	   the employees in the same after-tax position they would have enjoyed
	   had the excise tax not applied.  These provisions apply to all pay 
	   and benefits subject to the excise tax.  The provisions also apply 
	   whether or not a termination of employment has occurred because the 
	   Company's equity plans confer benefits which could trigger the 
	   excise tax provisions even if employment is not terminated.  No 
	   gross-up is payable if the payments to an eligible employee are not
	   subject to the golden parachute excise tax.

CHANGE IN 
CONTROL:   The definition includes a change in the majority of the Board of 
	   Directors not otherwise approved by the Incumbent Directors, the 
	   acquisition of 30% or more of the voting stock of Apple by a third
	   party, or a merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction if 
	   the stockholders of Apple before the transaction do not own, 
	   immediately after the transaction, more than 50% of the combined 
	   voting power of the resulting corporation.

AMENDMENT: The Executive Severance Plan cannot be amended after the Change in 
	   Control Date to eliminate or reduce benefits.  No amendment reducing
	   benefits will be effective if made within the 1-year period prior to 
	   the Change in Control Date.

Exhibit 10.A.34

Retention Agreement


Dear Ellen:

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"),
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take 
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of 
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and 
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in 
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of 
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps 
should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in 
control of the Company.

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company,
the Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this 
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in 
the event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words in
Section 8 of this Agreement.

		1.  Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of your
employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control Date
and shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control Date
(the "Term").

		2.  Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

		(a)  Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, 
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no 
less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the 
Change in Control Date.

		(b)  Salary and Bonus.  Your base salary and annual bonus 
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically 
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to 
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

		(c)  Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

					36
<PAGE>

		(d)  Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in all 
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company 
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate, 
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the 
Company.

		(e)  Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control 
Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel for business 
purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the amount of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date. 

		3.  Involuntary Termination During the Term.  

		(a)  Severance Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the 
date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but unpaid
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time
of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of
your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have accrued
as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within 5 days of
the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus for the year in 
which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the basis of your 
target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all performance targets
have been or will be achieved.  In addition, the Company shall pay you in a 
cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date of your execution of the 
release described in the last sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of
Termination, if later), an amount (the "Severance Payment") equal to the sum of
(i) two times your Reference Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.  
The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any other severance payments which 
you are entitled to receive under any other severance pay plan or arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance 
Payment shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor of the 
Company in substantially the form of the release required for the receipt of 
severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this 
Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period
specified therein.

		(b)  Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue 
to be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as 
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe 
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your 
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions in effect for you and
your dependents immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For 
purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the 
period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the earlier to occur
of (i) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination and (ii) the date that
you and your dependents are eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a 
subsequent employer which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits
to you and your dependents.
	
		(c)  Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination of your 
employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated by a 
notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "Notice of Termination").  
The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in 
this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts 
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your employment
under the provision so indicated.  The date of your termination of employment 
with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Date of Termination") shall be 
determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, 
thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you 
shall not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such
thirty (30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by the Company 
in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the Notice of 
Termination is received by you and (iii) if your employment is terminated by
the Company for Cause, the later of the date specified in the Notice of 
Termination or ten (10) days following the date such notice is received by 
you.  

					37
<PAGE>

If the basis for your Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good 
Reason, the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your 
Notice of Termination is received by the Company.   The Date of Termination 
for a resignation of employment other than for Good Reason shall be the date 
set forth in the applicable notice, which shall be no earlier than ten (10) 
days after the date such notice is received by the Company.		
		
		(d)  No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required to 
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise except 
as specifically provided in clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 3(b).

		4.  Additional Payment.  

		(a)  Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the 
contrary, if it is determined that any Payment would be subject to the excise 
tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with 
respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or 
penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be
entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will
place you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed 
if the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up 
Payment shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the 
formula {(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting 
Firm deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

		E	equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess
			parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G
			(b)(1) of the Code;

		M	equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes
			applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

		T	equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the 
			Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm 
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

 		(b)	Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the 
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this Section 4, 
including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the Payments 
constituting excess parachute payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting 
calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen days of the Change in 
Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other date reasonably requested 
by you or the Company on which a determination under this Section 4 is
necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay to you the initial Gross-Up 
Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you and the Company of the Accounting
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide you with
an opinion that the Accounting Firm has substantial authority under the Code 
and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your federal income tax return.  
Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you and the 
Company.


					38
<PAGE>

If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount of the 
Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be owing by you with respect to any
Payment (hereinafter an "Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its 
remedies under Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional 
Gross-Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

		(c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of 
any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require 
the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice shall be given
as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise the 
Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested
to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the 
thirty-day period following the date on which you notify the Company, or such 
shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with respect to such claim are due 
(the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in writing prior to the 
expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, you shall:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company 
relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the claim as
the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, accepting
legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably 
selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with
the Company in good faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company
to participate in any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the
Company to control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, 
permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, 
proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of
such claim.  If requested by the Company, you agree either to pay the tax 
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner and
to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative 
tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate 
courts as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company
directs you to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the Company shall advance 
the amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and interest-free basis (the 
"Advance").  The Company's control of the contest related to the claim shall be
limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up Payment and you shall be entitled
to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issues raised by the 
Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If the Company does not
notify you in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to 
contest the claim, the Company shall pay to you an additional Gross-Up Payment
in respect of the excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim,
and you agree to pay the amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the 
claim to the applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

		(d)  Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an Advance, you 
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance 
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together with any
interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after 
receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be 
entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not 
promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then the 
amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you and the amount
thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up Payment then owing
to you.  

		(e)  Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify you and 
hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any costs, expenses, penalties, 
fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by you with respect to 
the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, 
including, without limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to
contest a claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 
action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  The Company shall pay 
all legal fees and expenses incurred under this Section 4, and shall promptly
reimburse you for the reasonable expenses incurred by you in connection with 
any actions taken by the Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, 
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion

<PAGE>

		(f)  Combined Payments.   Anything in this Section 4 to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a 
required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount of all
Combined Payments has at the time such payment is due exceeded the Limit.  If 
the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in 
the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you only the
portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can be paid to you without 
causing the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments to exceed the Limit. In 
the event that you are entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and
other employees or former employees of the Company are also entitled to 
gross-up payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined
Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such payments would cause the 
Limit on Combined Payments to be exceeded, the Company shall allocate the 
amount of the reduction necessary to comply with the Limit among all such 
payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-up payment bears
to the aggregate amount of all such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) 
shall require you to repay to the Company any amount that was previously paid
to you under this Section 4.

		5.  Other Provisions.  

		(a)  Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted to you
under the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become 
exercisable in the event of your Involuntary Termination on or following the 
Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date of the
Equity Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will vest and become 
exercisable as of such date.

		(b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the 
terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the 
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that 
the Administrator elects not to cash out such Equity Awards, the Administrator
has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such Equity Awards to be
assumed or an equivalent option or stock appreciation right granted by the 
successor corporation to the Company or a parent or subsidiary of such 
successor corporation, or (ii) to provide that your Equity Awards will remain
outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning on the date that you are so 
notified of such action by the Administrator and that such Equity Awards will
expire to the extent not exercised at the end of such thirty-day period (the 
"30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator determines to utilize the 30-Day
Alternative, the Company shall pay you with respect to each such Equity Award
the excess, if any (the "Additional Amount"), of the Change in Control Price
you would have received had the Equity Award been cashed out on the date of 
the Equity Plan Change in Control over the value of the consideration actually
received by you in settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such
consideration is received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary
Termination on or after the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the date
of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you the Additional
Amount as if your employment had continued through the date of the Equity Plan 
Change in Control.  In either case, the payment of the Additional Amount shall
be made within 5 days following the determination by the Administrator of the 
Change in Control Price.

		(c)  Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time or is 
structured in such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely that you would 
be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing profits under 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability") if you were to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through a merger) of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, such transaction and (ii) your
inability to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term 
Awards on or prior to the date of such Equity Plan Change in Control eliminates
or reduces the value of some or all of your Short-Term Awards, then, on the 
date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company  shall pay you in a cash
lump sum the amount of $0.  The  provisions of  clause (ii) of the previous   

    					40
<PAGE>

sentence shall be deemed to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising,
tendering or otherwise disposing of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Transaction Date in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b) a 
Short-Term Award cannot be repurchased, exchanged or cashed-out by the Company
(or other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date without a risk of 
Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are required to delay the 
exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards in order
to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability and such delay results in your receiving
consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued at the date such consideration
is received) which is of lesser value than the consideration you would have 
received (valued as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control) for such 
awards had such delay not occurred.  The foregoing provisions shall apply to 
your Equity Awards notwithstanding your Involuntary Termination of employment
with the Company on or after the Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity
Plan Change in Control.  The provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if
(A) prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company provides you at its
expense with an opinion from a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating
that the exercise, tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards
as part of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan Change in
Control will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability and (B) following
your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you to exercise, 
tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the
Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing the value thereof.   

		(d)  General.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary not
withstanding, in no event shall the vesting and exercisability provisions 
applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be less favorable to 
you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof. 

		6.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or 
reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which
reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by you
as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your 
termination of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or 
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) 
arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of
this Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however, that the amount of
the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall not exceed $2 
million.

		7.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a)  Assumption by Successor. The Company will require any 
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no 
such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such assumption 
shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this 
Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees 
to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

		(b)  Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, 
consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of 
and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, 
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you
should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had 
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or
other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.

		8.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

		"Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such firm is 
unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national
accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement between you and the 
Company.  To the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting firm shall
be designated to perform the calculations in respect of the Combined 
Arrangements.

		"Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in 
the applicable Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity Plan,

willful and continued failure substantially to perform your duties with the 
Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to 
physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting
from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a written demand for 
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, which demand 
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that you have
not substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not 
substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such demand.   For
purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall
be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good 
faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the 
best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice 
to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard 
before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were
guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first 
sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		"Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6
(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, 
whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; 
provided, however, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

		(i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, 
	trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any 
	syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the 
	Exchange Act, is  or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in 
	Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange 
	Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing
	30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then 
	outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election of directors
 	of the Company;

		(ii)  during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not 
	including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement) 
	individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board
	and any new directors, whose election by the Board or nomination for	
	election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at 
	least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then still in office 
	who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose 	
	election or nomination for election was previously so approved (the 
	"Incumbent Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority 
	thereof; 

					42
<PAGE>

		(iii)  There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation 
	or other corporate transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),
	in each case, with respect to which the stockholders of the Company 
	immediately prior to such Transaction do not, immediately after the

	the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;

		(iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are

executes an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence
of a Change in Control, (iii) the date the Board approves a transaction or 
series of transactions, the consummation of which would result in a Change in 
Control and (iv) the date the Company fails to satisfy its obligations to have
this agreement assumed by any successor to the Company in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change in Control Date occurs as a 
result of an agreement described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence or 
as a result of the approval of the Board described in clause (iii) of the 
previous sentence and the Change in Control to which such agreement or approval
relates (the "Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, 
then the Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date") following the
date the Board certifies by resolution duly adopted by three-fourths (3/4ths) 
of the Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in 
Control is not reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this 
sentence shall not apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment
with the Company has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on or
prior to the Reset Date or (B) the Contemplated Change in Control subsequently 
occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following the Reset Date, the 
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and a new Term shall
commence upon the occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.  
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, if your employment with the
Company terminates prior to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably 
demonstrated that your termination of employment (i) was at the request of the
third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in 
Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of the 
Change in Control, then Change in Control Date shall mean the date immediately
prior to the date of your termination of employment.

		"Change in Control Price" shall mean the "Change in Control 
Price" as defined in the applicable Equity Plan and determined by the

terms thereof as one of the Combined Arrangements and the Supplement to the 
Severance Plan.

independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable to make such 
selection, such selection shall be made by any adult member of your immediate 
family), and approved by the Company.  The determination of such physician made
in writing to the Company and to you shall be final and conclusive for all

Exhibit 10.A.35


June 27, 1996
Mr. George M. Scalise
26055 Newbridge Road
Los Altos Hills, California  94022


Retention Agreement


Dear George:

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), 
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take 
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of 
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and 
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in 
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of 
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps 
should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in 
control of the Company.

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, 
the Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this 
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in 
the event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words 
in Section 8 of this Agreement.

		1.	Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of 
your employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control 
Date and shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control
Date (the "Term").

		2.	Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the 
following terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

		(a)	Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, 
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no 
less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the 
Change in Control Date.

					49
<PAGE>

		(b)	Salary and Bonus.  Your base salary and annual bonus 
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically 
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to 
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

		(c)	Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

		(d)	Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company 
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate, 
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the 
Company.

		(e)	Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control 
Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel for business 
purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the amount of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date. 

		3.	Involuntary Termination During the Term.  

		(a)	Severance Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the 
date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but unpaid 
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time
of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of 
your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have accrued 
as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within 5 days of
the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus for the year in
which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the basis of your 
target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all performance targets
have been or will be achieved.  In addition, the Company shall pay you in a 
cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date of your execution of the 
release described in the last sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of
Termination, if later), an amount (the "Severance Payment") equal to the sum 
of (i) two times your Reference Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.
The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any other severance payments which 
you are entitled to receive under any other severance pay plan or arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance 
Payment shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor of the 
Company in substantially the form of the release required for the receipt of 
severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this 
Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period 
specified therein.

<PAGE>

		(b)	Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue 
to be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as 
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe 
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your 
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions in effect for you 
and your dependents immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For 
purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the 
period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the earlier to occur
of (i) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination and (ii) the date that
you and your dependents are eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a 
subsequent employer which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits
to you and your dependents.

		(c)	Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination of 
your employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated
by a notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "Notice of 
Termination").  The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific 
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in 
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for 
termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.  The date of 
your termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Date
of Termination") shall be determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is 
terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is 
given (provided that you shall not have returned to the full-time performance 
of your duties during such thirty (30) day period), (ii) if your employment is
terminated by the Company in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after 
the date the Notice of Termination is received by you and (iii) if your 
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, the later of the date 
specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10) days following the date such
notice is received by you.  If the basis for your Involuntary Termination is 
your resignation for Good Reason, the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) 
days after the date your Notice of Termination is received by the Company.   
The Date of Termination for a resignation of employment other than for Good 
Reason shall be the date set forth in the applicable notice, which shall be no
earlier than ten (10) days after the date such notice is received by the 
Company.		
		
		(d)	No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required to 
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking 
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit 
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as 
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise except 
as specifically provided in clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 3(b).

		4.	Additional Payment.  

					51
<PAGE>

		(a)	Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if it is determined that any Payment would be subject to the 
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties 
with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or
penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be
entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will
place you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed 
if the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up 
Payment shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the 
formula {(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting 
Firm deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

		E  equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess 
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code;

		M  equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes 
applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

		T  equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the 
Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm 
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

 		(b)  Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the 
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this Section 4,
including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the Payments 
constituting excess parachute payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen days of the Change in 
Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other date reasonably requested 
by you or the Company on which a determination under this Section 4 is 
necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay to you the initial Gross-Up 
Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you and the Company of the Accounting 
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is 
payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide you with
an opinion that the Accounting Firm has substantial authority under the Code 
and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your federal income tax return.
Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you and the 
Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount 
of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be owing by you with respect
to any Payment (hereinafter an "Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting 
its remedies under Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional 
Gross-Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.
_______________________________________

federal, state and local marginal rate of 56% would be expressed as .560.

<PAGE>

		(c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of 
any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require 
the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice shall be given
as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise the 
Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested
to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the thirty-
day period following the date on which you notify the Company, or such shorter
period ending on the date the Taxes with respect to such claim are due (the 
"Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in writing prior to the 
expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, you 
shall:  (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the 
Company relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the 
claim as the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, 
accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney 
reasonably selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to you; (iii) 
cooperate with the Company in good faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) 
permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to the claim.  
You shall permit the Company to control all proceedings related to the claim
and, at its option, permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all 
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing
authority in respect of such claim.  If requested by the Company, you agree 
either to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in 
any permissible manner and to prosecute such contest to a determination before
any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or 
more appellate courts as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that,
if the Company directs you to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the Company 
shall advance the amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and interest-
free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the contest related to 
the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up Payment and 
you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other 
issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If 
the Company does not notify you in writing prior to the end of the Notice 
Period of its desire to contest the claim, the Company shall pay to you an 
additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments that 
are the subject of the claim, and you agree to pay the amount of the Excise Tax
that is the subject of the claim to the applicable taxing authority in 
accordance with applicable law.

		(d)  Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an Advance, you 
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance 
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together with any 
interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after 
receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be 
entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not 
promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then the 
amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you and the amount
thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up Payment then owing 
to you.  

		(e)  Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify you and 
hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any costs, expenses, penalties, 
fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by you with respect to
the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, 
including, without limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to
contest a claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 

					53
<PAGE>

action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  The Company shall pay 
all legal fees and expenses incurred under this Section 4, and shall promptly 
reimburse you for the reasonable expenses incurred by you in connection with 
any actions taken by the Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, 
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion 
referred to in Section 4(b).		

		(f)  Combined Payments.   Anything in this Section 4 to the 
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a 
required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount of all 
Combined Payments has at the time such payment is due exceeded the Limit.  If 
the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in 
the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you only the 
portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can be paid to you without 
causing the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments to exceed the Limit. In 
the event that you are entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and 
other employees or former employees of the Company are also entitled to 
gross-up payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined
Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such payments would cause the 
Limit on Combined Payments to be exceeded, the Company shall allocate the 
amount of the reduction necessary to comply with the Limit among all such 
payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-up payment bears 
to the aggregate amount of all such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) 
shall require you to repay to the Company any amount that was previously paid 
to you under this Section 4.

		5.  Other Provisions.  

		(a)  Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted to you 
under the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become 
exercisable in the event of your Involuntary Termination on or following the
Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date of the
Equity Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will vest and become 
exercisable as of such date.

		(b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the 
terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the 
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that the
Administrator elects not to cash out such Equity Awards, the Administrator has
the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of all or substantially all 
of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such Equity Awards to be 
assumed or an equivalent option or stock appreciation right granted by the 
successor corporation to the Company or a parent or subsidiary of such 
successor corporation, or (ii) to provide that your Equity Awards will remain 
outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning on the date that you are so 
notified of such action by the Administrator and that such Equity Awards will 
expire to the extent not exercised at the end of such thirty-day period (the 
"30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator determines to utilize the 30-Day 
Alternative, the Company shall pay you with respect to each such Equity Award 
the excess, if any (the "Additional Amount"), of the Change in Control Price 
you would have received had the Equity Award been cashed out on the date of the
Equity Plan Change in Control over the value of the consideration actually

					54
<PAGE>

received by you in settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such 
consideration is received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary 
Termination on or after the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the date 
of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you the Additional 
Amount as if your employment had continued through the date of the Equity Plan 
Change in Control.  In either case, the payment of the Additional Amount shall 
be made within 5 days following the determination by the Administrator of the 
Change in Control Price.

		(c)  Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time or is 
structured in such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely that you would 
be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing profits under 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability") if you were to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through a merger) of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, such transaction and (ii) your
inability to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term 
Awards on or prior to the date of such Equity Plan Change in Control eliminates
or reduces the value of some or all of your Short-Term Awards, then, on the 
date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you in a cash
lump sum the amount of $0.00.  The provisions of clause (ii) of the previous 
sentence shall be deemed to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising,
tendering or otherwise disposing of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Transaction Date in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b) a 
Short-Term Award cannot be repurchased, exchanged or cashed-out by the Company 
(or other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date without a risk of
Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are required to delay the 
exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards in order
to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability and such delay results in your receiving 
consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued at the date such consideration
is received) which is of lesser value than the consideration you would have 
received (valued as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control) for such 
awards had such delay not occurred.  The foregoing provisions shall apply to 
your Equity Awards notwithstanding your Involuntary Termination of employment 
with the Company on or after the Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity
Plan Change in Control.  The provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if
(A) prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company provides you at its
expense with an opinion from a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating 
that the exercise, tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards
as part of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan Change in
Control will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability and (B) following 
your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you to exercise, 
tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing the value thereof.   

		(d)  General.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and exercisability provisions
applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be less favorable to 
you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof. 

					55
<PAGE>

		6.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or 
reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including, 
without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which 
reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by you 
as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your 
termination of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or 
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) 
arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of 
this Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however, that the amount of 
the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall not exceed $2 
million.

		7.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a)  Assumption by Successor. The Company will require any 
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner 
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no 
such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such assumption 
shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this 
Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees 
to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

		(b)  Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, 
consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of 
and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, 
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you
should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had 
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or
other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.

		8.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following 
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

		"Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such firm is 
unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national 
accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement between you and the 
Company.  To the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting firm shall
be designated to perform the calculations in respect of the Combined 
Arrangements.

		"Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in 
the applicable Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity Plan, 
the Board.

					56
<PAGE>

		"Cause" shall mean a termination of your employment during the 
Term which is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii) your willful 
disclosure of material trade secrets or other material confidential information
related to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your 
willful and continued failure substantially to perform your duties with the 
Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to 
physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting 
from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a written demand for 
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, which demand 
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that you have 
not substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not 
substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such demand.   For 
purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall 
be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good 
faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the 
best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be 
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice
to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard 
before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were
guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first 
sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		 "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 
6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, 
whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; 
provided, however, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

	(i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, 
trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any syndicate 
or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, is 
or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General 
Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 
securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power
of the Company's then outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election 
of directors of the Company;

	(ii)  during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including any 
period prior to the execution of this Agreement) individuals who at the 
beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new directors, whose 
election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders 
was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then
still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or 
whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved (the 
"Incumbent Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; 

					57
<PAGE>

	(iii)  There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or other 
corporate transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"), in each case, 
with respect to which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such 
Transaction do not, immediately after the Transaction, own more than 50 percent 
of the combined voting power of the Company or other corporation resulting from 
such Transaction;

	(iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold, 
liquidated or distributed; or

	(v)   there is a "change in control" of the Company within the meaning 
of Section 280G of the Code and the Regulations.

		"Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the 
date on which the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date on which the Company
executes an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence
of a Change in Control, (iii) the date the Board approves a transaction or 
series of transactions, the consummation of which would result in a Change in 
Control and (iv) the date the Company fails to satisfy its obligations to have 
this agreement assumed by any successor to the Company in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change in Control Date occurs as a 
result of an agreement described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as 
a result of the approval of the Board described in clause (iii) of the previous
sentence and the Change in Control to which such agreement or approval relates
(the "Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then the 
Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date") following the date the
Board certifies by resolution duly adopted by three-fourths (3/4ths) of the 
Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in Control is 
not reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this sentence shall not
apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment with the Company has 
occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on or prior to the Reset 
Date or (B) the Contemplated Change in Control subsequently occurs within three
months of the Reset Date.  Following the Reset Date, the provisions of this 
Agreement shall remain in effect and a new Term shall commence upon the 
occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first 
sentence of this section, if your employment with the Company terminates prior 
to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably demonstrated that your 
termination of employment (i) was at the request of the third party who has 
taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in Control or (ii) 
otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control,
then Change in Control Date shall mean the date immediately prior to the date 
of your termination of employment.

		"Change in Control Price" shall mean the "Change in Control 
Price" as defined in the applicable Equity Plan and determined by the 
Administrator as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, whether or
not the Administrator is required under the terms of the applicable Equity Plan
to determine such price as of such date.

		"Combined Arrangements" shall mean this Agreement, the 
Retention Agreements entered into as of the date first set forth above between 
the Company and certain of its executive officers, any Retention Agreement 
entered into after the date hereof which is specifically designated by the 
terms thereof as one of the Combined Arrangements and the Supplement to the 
Severance Plan.

					58
<PAGE>

		"Combined Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash amount of (i) 
severance payments made to you under Section 3(a) of this Agreement or to any 
other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement, (ii) severance payments made under Sections 
2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-Up Payments made to you under 
Section 6 of this Agreement or to any other employee or former employee under 
the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangement, (iv) fees 
and expenses which are paid or reimbursed to you under Section 6 of this 
Agreement or to any other employee or former employee under the corresponding 
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangement, (v) payments made to you 
under Section 5 of this Agreement or to any other employee or former employee

Exhibit 10.A.36
			AIRPLANE USE AGREEMENT
			    # C98-96-00012

This Airplane Use Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the 27th day of
June, 1996, by and between Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation, 
having its principal place of business at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA  95014
("Apple"), Gilbert F. Amelio, 13416 Middle Fork Lane, Los Altos Hills, CA  
94022 ("Amelio"), and Aero Ventures, 13416 Middle Fork Lane, Los Altos Hills, 
CA  94022 ("Aero Ventures").
	
			     INTRODUCTION

Amelio owns and Aero Ventures manages an airplane (N55OAV) which will be used 
for Apple business-related travel.

			       AGREEMENT
1.	Ownership

Amelio represents and warrants that he is the sole owner of the aircraft 
described in Exhibit A ("the Airplane").  Amelio must inform Apple immediately 
upon any change in his ownership status of the Airplane.

2.	Apple's Rights and Responsibilities

2.1	Authorized Business Use.  Apple shall use the Airplane for travel on 
Apple business when such use is appropriate and is specified on a Travel 
Authorization Form approved prior to the commencement of travel in accordance
with Apple's applicable Corporate and Finance policies ("Authorized Business 
Use").

2.2	Apple's Lease of the Airplane.  Apple shall lease the Airplane from 
Amelio for Authorized Business Use at the Apple Lease Rate, as described below.
Such leased use shall include travel for Authorized Business Uses.  Apple will 
pay the pilot and/or co-pilot directly for piloting fees.

2.3	Costs Paid By Apple.  In addition to the payments described in Section 
2.2 above, Apple will reimburse Amelio for (1) costs actually incurred by 
Amelio to maintain currency and proficiency as a pilot, such as flight medical 
expenses and simulator training; and (2) the costs of food, beverages, other 
personal items, parking fees, landing fees, and fuel incurred during Authorized
Business Use by Apple.
					65
<PAGE>

2.4	Apple Lease Rate.  Apple will pay to Amelio an hourly rate for lease 
of the Airplane based on actual flying time as recorded on the Airplane's log 
book.  This Apple Lease Rate is determined to be the fair market value of such 
leased use, and as such will be subject to annual review and if necessary, 
adjustment.  The initial Apple Lease Rate shall be $700.00 per hour for all 
usage.  If Amelio upgrades to a more capable airplane, there will be no 
adjustment without prior Apple approval.

2.5	Apple Advance.  Apple will pay to Amelio a non-refundable, monthly 
advance on lease payments in the amount of  $6,000.  This monthly advance 
amount shall be applied against lease payments payable by Apple to Amelio for 
Authorized Business Use of the Airplane.  Apple may carry forward any unused 
monthly advance payments as credits toward lease payments due in subsequent 
months.  However, such carried-forward monthly advance payments shall not 
affect Apple's obligation to pay the full, monthly advance on lease payments.

2.6	Apple's Insurance.  Amelio will maintain $20 million of liability 
insurance.  Apple shall be responsible for any liability insurance coverage 
in excess of $20 million.

2.7	No Other Obligations.  The payments and reimbursements specified in 
this section shall constitute the extent of Apple's obligation to pay Amelio 
for the costs of maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and any and all other 
expenses related to maintaining the Airplane in flightworthy condition.

3.	Amelio's Responsibilities

3.1	Amelio's Use Of The Airplane.  Amelio's use of the Airplane in 
connection with his performance of services for Apple shall be limited to 
Authorized Business Use.

3.2	Amelio's Costs.  Amelio shall be responsible for payment of all costs
not specifically charged to Apple in this Agreement.

3.3	Amelio's Pilot Training And License.  Amelio is responsible for 
arranging for and undertaking instruction and flying time to maintain currency
and proficiency as a pilot of the Airplane.  Amelio must notify Apple of any 
change or lapse in his pilot license status.

3.4	Amelio's Operation Of The Airplane.  When operating the Airplane on 
Apple Business Use, Amelio will maintain and operate the Airplane at all times 
in compliance with all Federal, state or local laws and regulations applicable
to the operation of the Airplane or private aircraft in general.  In addition, 
Amelio agrees to comply with any and all restrictions and limitations imposed 
by Apple's insurance policies related to Amelio's use of the Airplane.

					66
<PAGE>

3.5	Passengers.  Amelio understands and agrees that as a general policy, 
he will not carry as passengers on Authorized Business Use any persons who are 
not Apple employees, officers or directors.  To the extent there are legitimate 
business purposes for exceptions, Amelio will carry such non-Apple passengers 
only if they have each executed and filed with Apple a release, in form and 
substance approved in writing by Apple, releasing Apple from any and all 
liability arising out of such passenger accompanying Amelio on the Airplane in 
connection with an Authorized Business Use.

3.6	Indemnity And Insurance.

	(a)  Indemnity.  Amelio hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless 
	Apple, its directors, officers, employees and other agents 
	(collectively, "the Indemnitees") against and from any and all 
	liabilities, claims, demands, losses, costs and expenses of any kind
	or nature whatsoever which may be asserted against or suffered or 
	incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them arising out of or in 
	connection with Amelio's ownership, operation or use of the Airplane 	
	whether for Authorized Business Use or any other purpose and whether 
	in accordance with or in breach of this Agreement.  The foregoing 
	indemnity is specifically intended to apply whether or not any such 
	liability, claim, demand, loss, cost or expense may to any extent have 
	arisen out of or been based upon the negligence or claimed negligence 
	of Amelio or any of the Indemnitees.

	(b)  Insurance.  Amelio will carry Comprehensive General Liability 
	insurance from USAIG, AAU, CIGNA or another insurer suitable to Apple 
	with limits not less than $20,000,000 combined single limit per 
	occurrence and with a worldwide coverage territory.  Before operating 
	the Airplane on any Authorized Business Use, Amelio will deliver to 
	Apple a Certificate of Insurance which shows the coverage specified 
	above, which names Apple as an additional insured, and which provides 
	a 30-day notice period for cancellation or reduction in coverage or 
	limits.

4.	Term and Termination

4.1	Term.  This Agreement will become effective upon execution by Apple, 
and after approval by the Board of Directors of Apple.  The Agreement is

party will be released from all obligations and liabilities to the other 
occurring or arising after the date of such termination, except that the 
provisions of Sections 3.6(a), 4.3 and 6, and any liability arising from 
breach of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.  Neither 
party will be liable to the other for damages of any sort solely as a result 
of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as 
specifically provided above.  Termination of this Agreement will be without 
prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party.

5.	Upgrade

	It is Amelio's intention to upgrade the Airplane to a more capable 
airplane within the next 12 months.  Upon such upgrade, the lease rate will 
not be adjusted to reflect the fair market value for the new aircraft without
prior Apple approval.

6.	General

6.1	Applicable Law.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California as 
applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within 
California between California residents.

of, and waive any venue objections against, the United States District Court 
for the Northern District of  California, the Superior Court of the State of 
California for the County of Santa Clara, the Santa Clara Municipal Court, and
any mutually agreed to alternative dispute resolution proceeding taking place 
in Santa Clara County, California, in any litigation arising out of the 
Agreement.

6.3	Severability.  If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction 
finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent 
permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of 
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

Separation Agreement

	In consideration of the mutual agreements set forth below, Michael 
H. Spindler ("Spindler") and Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") agree to the 
following terms and conditions of this Separation Agreement (the 
"Agreement"):

	1.	Nature of Business.  Apple is in the business of designing, 
developing, producing, selling and marketing computer systems, related 
products and services.  The business practices of Apple and the market 
conditions in which Apple operates change rapidly and these changes 
have necessitated prompt changes in management, and/or managers' 
responsibilities.  These changes are needed from time to time in the high 
level management positions such as those for which Spindler has been 
employed.

	2.	Resignation from Board, Termination of Employment and 
Rescission of Retention Agreement.  Spindler has resigned from his 
position on Apple's Board of Directors effective as of February 2, 1996 and 
has been terminated from his position as Chief Executive Officer effective 
as of February 2, 1996.  Spindler also hereby resigns from all other 
positions he holds on behalf of Apple, its subsidiaries and affiliates (except 
for his position as an employee), which positions are set forth at Exhibit A 
hereto.  Spindler agrees to sign at Apple's request all appropriate 
mutually agreeable documentation prepared by Apple to facilitate these 
resignations and termination.

	Spindler and Apple agree that in exchange for the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, the June 9, 1995 Retention Agreement 
between Spindler and Apple, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 
B, is hereby rescinded and that neither party has any further rights or 
obligations under the Retention Agreement.

	3. 	 Employment Status/Termination.  During the period 
February 2, 1996 through March 31, 1996 ("Termination Date"), Spindler 
will remain an employee of Apple as provided in this paragraph reporting 
to Gilbert F. Amelio ("Amelio") and shall be available to assist Amelio as 
may be mutually agreed to between Spindler and Amelio.   Spindler shall

					72
<PAGE>

 be on sabbatical from February 15, 1996 through Termination Date.  Until 
Termination Date, Spindler will continue to receive his regular salary and
 full executive level medical insurance benefits.  Termination shall be 
accomplished by the return of Spindler's Apple Identification Badge to 
Edward B. Stead.  Beyond the return of Spindler's Apple Identification 
Badge, Spindler represents that all other Apple property has been 
returned to Apple and there are no further actions required to be taken by 
Spindler prior to Termination Date.  To the extent this Agreement varies 
from the terms and conditions of any Apple employee benefit plan, 
program or policy, or any other agreement, written or oral, this 
Agreement shall govern. 

	4.	Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination.  Within 
five (5) days of Termination Date, Apple will pay the following:

		a.	Severance Payments.   Spindler shall receive the full 
amount of his accrued but unpaid base salary earned through Termination 
Date plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of Spindler's base salary 
then in effect) for all accrued but unused vacation as of Termination Date.  
In addition, Apple shall also pay Spindler a lump sum payment of three 
million, seven hundred twelve thousand, five hundred dollars 
($3,712,500).  Apple shall continue to pay for and provide Spindler with 
health insurance benefits in accordance with terms and provisions of such 
plans and arrangements in effect on the Termination Date for a period of 
two (2) years from Termination Date.

Apple's Board of Directors (the "Board") previously granted Spindler 
options to purchase shares of Apple Common Stock under Apple's 1981 
and 1990 Stock Option Plans (the "1981 and 1990 Plans") and options to 
purchase shares of stock under Apple's 1987 Executive Long Term Stock 
Option Plan ("ELTSOP").  Except as expressly provided below, nothing in 
this Agreement shall alter the terms and conditions of such options and 
such options shall continue to vest and be exercisable in accordance with 
the terms of the grant agreement issued to  Spindler with respect to such 
grants, and the terms of the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans and the 
ELTSOP administered by the Board. As of Termination Date, (a) all stock 
option grants previously awarded to Spindler under the ELTSOP shall 
continue to vest for a period of one (1) year from Termination Date and 
shall be exercisable for a period of two (2) years from Termination Date 
provided, however, that all such options shall be subject to the 10-year 
expiration provisions of the ELTSOP, and (b) all stock option grants 
previously awarded to Spindler under the 1981 and 1990 Plans shall 
continue to vest during, and be exercisable for, a period of ninety (90) days 
from Termination Date.
					73
<PAGE>

The payment outlined in this Paragraph 4(a) shall constitute full 
satisfaction of all Apple's obligations to pay severance benefits to Spindler 
under Apple's Executive Severance Plan, as amended by the June 9, 1995 
Supplement, Apple's Senior/Executive Incentive Bonus, and any and all 
other written or oral agreements between Spindler and Apple including 
but not limited to, the employment agreement dated April 12, 1991, a copy 
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Except as provided for in 
Paragraph 3 above and in Paragraph 4(b) below, there shall be no other 
payments to Spindler except as stated in this Paragraph 4(a).

		b.	Relocation and House Repurchase.  Apple shall pay 
Spindler, in full satisfaction of any and all obligations to pay moving 
expenses for Spindler and his family under any Apple policy, plan or 
program a lump sum payment in the amount of fifty thousand dollars 
($50,000).  In addition, Apple shall pay Spindler one hundred fifty 
thousand dollars ($150,000) in full satisfaction of any and all obligations 
Apple may have had to purchase Spindler's Atherton, California house 
under any Apple plan, program, policy, or agreement, both oral and in 
writing.

		c	Receipt of Documentation.  Spindler acknowledges 
that he has previously received from Apple copies of pertinent portions of 
Apple's Executive Severance Plan, as amended by the June 9, 1995 
Supplement, Apple's Senior/Executive Bonus Program, Apple's 1981 and 
1990 Stock Option Plans, Apple's ELTSOP, Apple's Vacation and Holiday 
Policies, and Apple's Benefit Plans relating to health care, life insurance, 
accidental death and disability, short and long term disability and Savings 
Plans. Spindler understands and agrees to be bound by the written terms 
and conditions of these various plans, policies or programs, unless 
expressly provided for otherwise under this Agreement or in the Plan, and 
agrees that Apple has reserved the right and option, in its sole discretion, 
to change, interpret, modify or terminate these and all other plans, policies 
or programs at any time without Spindler's consent so long as such action 
does not conflict with or reduce Spindler's rights under this Agreement.

		d.	No Other Benefits.  Spindler will not be entitled to 
receive any other compensation, bonus or benefits provided by, through 
or on behalf of Apple, its affiliates or subsidiaries, other than benefits that 
are vested as of Termination Date and that are payable in accordance with 
the terms of any applicable Benefit Plan, or otherwise provided for herein.

					74
<PAGE>

	5.	Confidentiality.  The terms of this Agreement are 
confidential.  Neither Spindler nor Apple will at any time disclose to any 
third party the terms of this Agreement, except as authorized by this
agreement or as required by law.  Spindler may also make such disclosure 
to his spouse, tax advisor and/or lawyer, all of whom shall be instructed 
to keep the information disclosed to them confidential; any disclosure by 
any such party shall be deemed a disclosure by Spindler. Apple and 
Spindler shall not disparage each other in their communications in 
response to all inquiries from the press, public media or any other third 
parties regarding this Agreement or Spindler's employment termination.  
If Apple makes a press statement which disparages Spindler, then 
Spindler may invoke the procedures outlined in Paragraph 21 of this 
Agreement.  If Spindler makes a press statement which disparages Apple, 
then Apple may invoke the procedures outlined in Paragraph 21 of this 
Agreement.

	6.	Trade Secrets, Proprietary and Confidential Information.  
Spindler agrees to comply with Apple's "Proprietary Rights and 
Information Agreement" which is attached hereto as Exhibit D to this 
Agreement.

	In addition, Spindler agrees to continue to abide by the principles 
and guidelines in Apple's Global Ethics brochure, the terms of which are 
incorporated herein to the extent it applies to employee through 
Termination Date and to former employees thereafter.

	On or before Termination Date, Spindler agrees to promptly return 
to Apple or its records retention designee, all Apple proprietary and 
confidential information, including but not limited to all inventions, 
discoveries, improvements, computer programs, designs, documentation, 
notes, plans, drawings and copies thereof to Apple.  Spindler shall be 
entitled to keep as his own personal property the equipment listed at 
Exhibit E together with manuals and product data information associated 
with such equipment. 

	Spindler and Apple agree that this section regarding Trade Secrets, 
Proprietary and Confidential Information shall survive the termination of 
this Agreement.

	7.	Non-Solicitation.  Spindler further recognizes that Apple's 
work force constitutes an important and vital aspect of its business.  

					75
<PAGE>

Spindler agrees, therefore, that he shall not solicit others employed by 
Apple, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, to become employed by any 
firm, company or other business enterprise through March 31, 1997.  
Spindler further represents that he has no time prior to this Agreement 
solicited any employee to leave Apple. Nothing in this Agreement will 
prevent Spindler from providing favorable recommendations or favorable 
references on behalf of persons  who previously worked with Spindler.
		
	Spindler and Apple also agree, that upon a breach or violation or 
threatened breach or violation of any confidentiality, trade secrets, or non-
solicitation agreement by Spindler contained herein, or if any provision of 
Sections 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement, Apple, in addition to all other 
remedies which might be available to it including rescission of the 
Agreement and repayment of the consideration paid to Spindler for the 
covenants or promises breached, shall be entitled as a matter of right to 
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the right 
to obtain injunctive relief or specific performance.  Spindler and Apple 
agree that the remedies at law for any such breach or violation are not 
fully adequate and that the injuries to Apple as a result of the continuation 
of any breach or violation are incapable of full calculation in monetary 
terms and therefore constitute irreparable harm.  This Paragraph 7 shall 
survive the termination of this Agreement.

	8.	Indemnification.  All rights of indemnification previously 
provided by Apple to Spindler by Apple's By-Laws and/or by the 
Indemnification Agreement dated January 27, 1988 shall continue in full 
force and effect in accordance with their terms, following the date of this 
Agreement.  A copy of Spindler's Indemnification Agreement is attached 
hereto as Exhibit F to this Agreement.

	9.	Successors.  Apple will require any successor (whether 
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all 
or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Apple to expressly 
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the manner and to the 
same extent that Apple would be required to perform it if no such 
succession had taken place.  Failure of Apple to obtain such assumption 
and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall 
entitle Spindler to the benefits listed in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this 
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions therein.

	10.	Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, effect, and 
enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State 
of California without regard to its choice of law principles.

					76
<PAGE>

	11.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, and Exhibits A, B, C, D, 
E & F to this Agreement, set forth the entire Agreement and 
understanding between Spindler and Apple, and supersede any other 
negotiations, written agreements, understandings, oral agreements, 
representations or past or future practices, whether written or oral, by 
Apple, including but not limited to, the employment agreement between 
Apple and Spindler dated April 12, 1991, the July 26, 1995 letter 
employment agreement, and the June 9, 1995 Retention Agreement.  This 
Agreement may be amended only by written agreement, signed by the 
parties to be bound by the amendment.  Parol evidence will be 
inadmissible to show agreement by and between the parties to any term or 
condition contrary to or in addition to the terms and conditions contained 
in this Agreement.

	Each Apple plan or policy referred to herein directly or by 
implication (except the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans and the 
ELTSOP) is incorporated herein only insofar as it does not contradict this 
Agreement.  If any inconsistencies exist between this Agreement and any 
such plan or policy, this Agreement shall control.  If any inconsistencies 
exist between this Agreement and the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans or 
the ELTSOP, with the exception of the terms and conditions of Paragraph 
4 above, those stock plans shall control.

	12.	Right to Advice of Counsel.  Spindler understands that he 
has the right to have this Agreement reviewed by his lawyer and 
acknowledges that Apple has encouraged him to consult with his lawyer 
so that he is fully aware of his rights and obligations under this 
Agreement.  Spindler acknowledges that he has done so.  

	13.	Modification.  This Agreement may not be amended, 
modified, changed or discharged in any respect except as agreed in 
writing and signed by Spindler and the Chief Executive Officer of Apple 
Computer, Inc.

	14.	Severability and Interpretation.  In the event that any 
provision or any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or 
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or 
portion thereof shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder 
of this Agreement and the other provisions shall remain fully valid and 
enforceable, provided that, if Paragraph 2, 5, 6, 7, 19 or 21 is held to be 
invalid or unenforceable in response to a motion, argument or other act by 
Spindler, then Apple, at its sole discretion, may rescind the Agreement 
and recover all consideration paid to Spindler under the Agreement.

or in each case to such other address as Spindler or Apple shall notify the

	16.	Miscellaneous.  The rights and obligations of Apple under 
this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the 
present and future subsidiaries of Apple, any and all subsidiaries of a 
subsidiary, all affiliated corporations, and successors and assigns of 
Apple.  No assignment of this Agreement by Apple will relieve Apple of 
its obligations.  Spindler shall not assign any of his rights and/or 
obligations under this Agreement and any such attempted assignment 
will be void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of Spindler's heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal 
representatives and their legal assigns.

	17.	Damage Limitation.  At Termination Date, Spindler shall 
not be entitled to recover any compensation, benefits or damages except as 
specifically described in this Agreement.  This damage waiver provides 
that no damages (including without limitation, special, consequential, 
general, liquidated or punitive damages or attorneys fees or costs) shall be 
sought or due from Apple.

	18.	Waiver.  A waiver by either party of any of the terms or 
conditions of this Agreement in any instance shall not be deemed or 
construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any 
subsequent breach thereof.  All remedies, rights, undertakings, 
obligations, and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be 
cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy, 
right, undertaking, obligation or agreement of either party.

					78
<PAGE>

	19.	Release.  Spindler hereby completely releases and forever 
discharges Apple, its Board of Directors, officers, directors, agents, 
employees, attorneys, insurers, subsidiaries and affiliates ("Apple 
Parties") from, and covenants not to sue any Apple Party with respect to, 
all claims, rights, demands, actions, obligations, debts, sums of money, 
damages (including but not limited to general, special, punitive, 
liquidated and compensatory damages) and causes of action of every 
kind, nature and character, known and unknown, in law or equity, 
connected with Spindler's employment relationship with the Apple 
Parties, or any other act or omission of any Apple Party which may have 
occurred prior to the date this Agreement is signed.  Spindler further 
agrees that by his acceptance and negotiation of the payment provided for 
in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement, he thereby completely releases and 
forever discharges the Apple Parties from, and covenants not to sue any 
Apple Party with respect to, all claims, rights, demands, actions, 
obligations, debts, sums of money, damages (including but not limited to 
general, special, punitive, liquidated and compensatory damages) and 
causes of action of every kind, nature and character, known and 
unknown, in law or equity, connected with Spindler's employment 
relationship with the Apple Parties, or the termination of such 
relationship, or any other act or omission of any Apple Party which may 
have occurred prior to Termination Date. This release and discharge 
includes, but is not limited to, all "wrongful discharge" claims; all claims 
relating to any contracts of employment, express or implied; any covenant 
of good faith and fair dealing, express or implied; any tort of any nature: 
any federal, state, or municipal statute or ordinance; any claims under the 
California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, and any other laws and regulations 
relating to employment discrimination and any and all claims for 
attorney's fees and costs.  Spindler specifically acknowledges that the 
foregoing release includes a complete release and discharge of all Apple 
Parties from any and all claims, damages of any kind, and claims for 
attorneys fees and costs, under the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967 ("ADEA") as amended by the Older Worker Benefit Protection 
Act ("OWBPA").  Spindler and Apple agree that part of the consideration 
payable to Spindler under this Agreement is consideration that Spindler 
would not otherwise be entitled to and is in consideration for Spindler's 
release of claims under the ADEA as amended by the OWBPA.

					79
<PAGE>

	Spindler acknowledges that he understands the protections 
provided by the OWBPA and that the provisions of the OWBPA have 
been met by the terms of this Agreement.  Spindler states that he 
knowingly and voluntarily enters into this Agreement.  Spindler 
acknowledges that this Agreement is written in a manner calculated to be 
understood by him. Spindler further acknowledges that this Agreement 
refers without limitation to rights under the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act.  Spindler understands that by this Agreement, he does 
not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the Agreement is 
executed.  Spindler acknowledges that he is entering this Agreement in 
exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which he 
already is entitled due to his employment with Apple.  Further, Spindler 
acknowledges that this release of claims under the OWBPA is not 
requested in connection with an exit incentive program or other 
employment termination program offered to a group or class of 
employees within the meaning of OWBPA.  Notwithstanding this 
provision, Spindler acknowledges that he has been allowed up to forty 
five (45) days from the date that he received this Agreement to accept its 
terms.  Spindler acknowledges he has consulted with an attorney about 
the Agreement.  Spindler acknowledges that after he signs the Agreement, 
he will then be given seven (7) days following the date on which he signs 
the Agreement to revoke it and that this Agreement will only become 
effective after this seven (7) day period has lapsed.  Any such revocation 
must be in writing signed by Spindler and immediately delivered to 
Apple's General Counsel.

	Spindler has read and expressly waives Section 1542 of the 
California Civil Code, which provides as follows:

	A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING
THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS 
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

	This waiver is not a mere recital, but is a known waiver of rights 
and benefits.  This is a bargained-for provision of this Agreement and is 
further consideration for the covenants and conditions contained herein.

	The Apple Parties hereby release and forever discharge Spindler, 
his agents and attorneys from, and covenant not to sue Spindler, his 

					80
<PAGE>

agents and attorneys with respect to, all claims, rights, demands, actions, 
obligations, debts, sums of money, damages, and causes of action 
("claims") arising from his employment relationship with Apple to the 
extent permitted by law and public policy, except for any claims arising 
from any intentional acts of misconduct, or any other act taken in bad faith 
or without a reasonable belief that it was in the best interests of the Apple 
Parties. 

	20.	Cooperation.  Spindler agrees that he will make himself 
available at reasonable times and intervals to participate in the conduct of 
and preparation for any pending or future litigation to which Apple is a 
party and in which his experience or knowledge may be relevant.  
Spindler shall be reimbursed for his reasonable travel and out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by virtue of his cooperation as described in this 
Paragraph.  In no respect shall this provision be deemed to pertain to or 
affect the nature or substance of Spindler testimony at deposition or trial 
or in any other truthful testimony at deposition or trial or in any other 
circumstances.

	21.	Remedies in Event of Future Dispute.
		
		a.	Except as provided in sub Paragraph (b) below, in the 
event of any future dispute, controversy or claim between the parties 
arising from or relating to this Agreement, its breach, any matter 
addressed by this Agreement, and/or Spindler's employment with Apple 
through Termination Date, the parties will first attempt to resolve the 
dispute through confidential mediation to be conducted in San Francisco 
by a member of the firm of Gregoria, Haldeman & Piazza, Mediated 
Negotiations, 625 Market Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, California 94105.  
If the parties' dispute is not resolved through mediation, it will be 
resolved through binding confidential arbitration to be conducted by the  
American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, pursuant to its 
California Employment Dispute Resolution Rules, and judgment upon the 
award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court having 
jurisdiction of the matter.  The prevailing party in such arbitration shall be 
entitled to recover from the losing party, not only the amount of any 
judgment awarded in its favor, but also any and all costs and expenses, 
incurred in arbitrating the dispute or in preparing for such arbitration.

		b.	In the event that a dispute arises concerning 
compliance with this Agreement, either party will be entitled to obtain 

					81
<PAGE>

from a court with jurisdiction over the parties preliminary and permanent 
injunctive relief to enjoin or restrict the other party from such breach or to 
enjoin or restrict a third party from inducing any such breach, and other 
appropriate relief, including money damages.  In seeking any such relief, 
however, the moving party will retain the right to have any remaining 
portion of the controversy resolved by binding confidential arbitration in 
accordance with sub paragraph (a) above.

	By signing the below, the parties agree to the terms hereof, 
including the Exhibits hereto, and agree that this document, and Exhibits 
A, B, C, D, E & F hereto, set forth their entire agreement, except as 
otherwise expressly provided herein.

	remain in effect until July 1, 1999 (the "Initial Term"), unless 
	earlier terminated pursuant to Section 18 (Termination) or renewed 
	pursuant to Section 2.3 (Renewal Terms), below.

2.3	Renewal Terms.  This Agreement will renew automatically for successive 
	one (1) year renewal terms (the "Renewal Terms") unless one party 
	provides the other written notice of its intent not to renew the 
	Agreement at least ninety (90) days before the end of the Initial Term 
	or any Renewal Term thereafter.  The provisions of Section 3 
	(Percentage Volume Commitments) will not apply in any Renewal Term.

	total annual volumes of Apple-labeled personal computer systems and of
	main logic boards for such systems, excluding OEM and ODM boards or 
	systems, that are manufactured for sale in the Americas during such 
	year ("Percentage Volume Commitment"):

			Year 1		   Year 2		Year 3
		   (7/1/96-6/30/97)   (7/1/97-6/30/98)	   (7/1/98-6/30/99)
	

	Main Logic
	Boards 		  60%		     50%		  40%
	
	Computer
	Systems		   40%		     40%		  30%


3.2	Conditions.  Apple's Percentage Volume Commitment is conditioned upon 
	and subject to:	
	
	(i)	SCI offering and delivering Products with comparable quality, 
		and with competitive pricing, Lead Time and flexibility terms, 
		when compared with other suppliers located in the United States 
		who provide a comparable range of contract manufacturing and 
		engineering services similar to those SCI provides in 
		connection with Products;  

	(ii)	SCI allocating adequate capacity at Fountain or with Apple's 
		prior written approval, at other SCI Systems, Inc. facilities 
		to deliver such volumes to Apple; and

	(iii)	SCI's performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

					90
<PAGE>


	To the extent SCI fails to do so, Apple may, without prejudice to any 
	other rights or remedies available to it, apply volumes manufactured 
	elsewhere, by Apple or any third party, to its satisfaction of the 
	Percentage Volume Commitment.  

3.3	Volumes Manufactured at Another SCI Facility.  Apple will have the 
	option to move volumes above SCI's Base Factory Load (as defined in 
	Exhibit B, Schedules 1 and 2) to any other SCI facility to achieve more
 	competitive pricing, better service, better quality or for any other 
	reason.  All such volumes will be credited against Apple's Percentage 
	Volume Commitment.

3.4	Failure to Meet Percentage Volume Commitment.  If Apple does not meet 
	its Percentage Volume Commitment in Year 1, Year 2 or Year 3 of the 
	Initial Term for any reason other than SCI's breach of this Agreement, 
	failure to allocate adequate capacity to Apple, or failure to offer 
	competitive product on competitive terms and conditions, as required 
	above, Apple may remedy its obligations under this Agreement in one of
	two ways;  either by:

	(i) 	adding the shortfall (the number of units Apple was committed 
		to purchase less the number it actually purchased from SCI 
		during that year) to Apple's commitment for the following year 
		(except a shortfall in year 3); or

	(ii)	paying SCI the profit that SCI would have enjoyed had Apple 
		purchased the shortfall.  The profit will be calculated by 
		multiplying:
		
		-	the shortfall (the number of units Apple was committed 
			to purchase less the number it actually purchased from 
			SCI during that year); 

		-	the average unit cost (excluding profit) of product in 
			the category in which there was a shortfall (i.e. 
			boards or systems); and 

		-	the percentage profit that would have applied to the 
			shortfall per the Pricing Formula set forth in Exhibit 
			A. 
	
	Apple's failure to do so within three (3) months after the end of the 
	year in which the shortfall occurred will constitute a breach of the 
	Agreement.

4.	PRODUCT PLANS

4.1	Generally.  Apple and SCI will establish a Product Plan, in the format

	procedures, defect containment plan, recall risks, repair capabilities 
	and costs, business risk insurance, and known liabilities.

9.2	Incoming Inspection.  Apple may inspect Product Delivered under this 
	Agreement for deficiencies in workmanship or material either at the 
	Delivery Point and/or at its destination.  Apple may return defective 
	or non-conforming Products to SCI at SCI's cost (using SCI's selected 
	carrier) within thirty (30) days after Delivery in accordance with the 
	agreed RMA procedure set forth in the Product Plan.  

9.3	Ship to Stock/Ship to Distribution.  This Agreement and the Pricing 
	Schedules are based on the assumption that SCI can produce the Products	
	at quality levels suitable for shipment directly to Apple's 
	distribution system.  SCI's inability to achieve certification status 
	as defined in Exhibit E, will create a significant increase in costs to 
	Apple.  SCI will develop a plan to meet such requirements and 
	understands that failure to achieve certification status within a 
	reasonable time frame may result in disqualification as an approved 
	Apple supplier.

9.4	On-Site Inspections.  SCI acknowledges that it is essential for Apple 
	to have periodic access to SCI's premises for the purpose of conducting
	inspections and/or audits under this Agreement, including, without 
	limitation, audits of SCI's compliance with the Quality Requirements 
	and with export and environmental laws.  Upon reasonable notice, SCI 
	will allow Apple, during SCI's normal business hours, to visit its 
	facility to discuss and inspect its manufacturing processes, test the 
	Products, review SCI's records, etc.  Such inspections/audits and any 
	testing done by Apple during them, will not relieve SCI of liability 
	for Products later found to be defective or for SCI's failure to meet 
	its obligations under this Agreement.

9.5	Agency Approvals.  Unless the parties agree otherwise in the Product 
	Plan, Apple will be responsible for obtaining agency and regulatory 
	approvals; provided, however, that SCI will provide Apple all 
	information and assistance reasonably requested by Apple for the 
	purpose of obtaining such approvals.  If recertification is required 
	due to changes to a Product requested by SCI, SCI may be required 
	obtain and bear the cost of such recertification.

10.	PRICING

10.1	The Pricing Formula.  The unit price of each Product manufactured at 
	Fountain will be determined using the pricing formula set forth in 
	Exhibit B.  SCI will provide Apple a price quote for each new Product 
	proposed by Apple as set forth in Section 4.2, above.  The unit price 
	agreed upon by the parties will be set forth in the Pricing Schedule 
	for such Product; provided, however, that such prices may vary in 
	accordance with Section 10.2, below.   

10.2	Labor Rates and Other Cost Adders.  The Labor Rate and Other Cost Adder
	components of the pricing formula are variable depending on the actual 
	load at Fountain in each quarter of the Term, as follows:

					98
<PAGE>


	The Labor Rate (for the Initial Products and any new Products) will be 
	determined as set forth in Schedule 1 to Exhibit B based on the total 
	number of "Applicable Labor Hours" during the quarter. "Applicable 
	Labor Hours" is defined in Schedule 1 to Exhibit B.  

	The Other Cost Adders (for the Initial Products and any new Products) 
	will be determined as set forth in Schedule 2 to Exhibit B depending on
	the total number of "Applicable Units" manufactured by SCI during the 
	quarter.  "Applicable Units" is defined in Schedule 2 to Exhibit B.

	For purposes of pricing in Years 2 and 3 of the Initial Term of this 
	Agreement, SCI will be responsible for a portion of the factory load if
 	Apple's load falls below a hypothetical "Base Factory Load" defined in 
	Schedules 1 and 2 to Exhibit B. This Base Factory Load is for pricing 
	purposes only and does not represent a purchase commitment of any kind.  

	Both the Labor Rates and Other Cost Adders for a given calendar quarter 
	will be determined prospectively based on Apple's forecasts for upcoming 
	quarter.  At the end of the quarter, the Labor Rate and Other Cost Adders
	will be adjusted retrospectively to reflect the actual number of units 
	manufactured by SCI and Standard Labor Hours expended by SCI during that 
	quarter.  Within ten (10) business days after the end of each calendar 
	quarter, SCI will:

	(a)	provide Apple written verification of the actual volumes 
		manufactured by SCI during the quarter, including: the number 
		of units manufactured for Apple under the Agreement; the number	
		of units manufactured at Fountain for Mac OS Licensees; the 
		Apple Standard Hours (as defined in Schedule 1 to Exhibit B); 
		and the Third Party Standard Hours (as defined in Schedule 1 to 
		Exhibit B); and

	(b)	identify to Apple any overpayment or any underpayment resulting 
		from a difference between Apple's forecasts and actual volumes 
		during the quarter which shall be paid to either party, as 
		appropriate, within thirty (30) days.

10.3	Standard Labor Hours.  When determining the number of hours required to 
	assemble and test each new Product, SCI will use a methodology 
	consistent with that used in quoting the Initial Product prices.  This 
	methodology is set forth in Exhibit B.  

10.4	Procured Material Cost.  The Procured Material Cost for Initial 
	Products will be based on the cost of materials purchased from Apple 
	(Initial Inventory or Additional Apple Inventory) on a dollar for 
	dollar basis.  Thereafter, SCI will adjust the Procured Material Cost 
	to the lowest prices available from its vendors according to the 
	following schedule:

					99
<PAGE>


	For Category A items:  immediately (will be credited retroactively at 
			       end of month)
	For Category B items:  monthly
	For Category C items:  quarterly
	
	Where:
	
	Category A =	hard drives, CD-ROM drives, RAM, flat panel displays, 
			MPUs and other strategic components added to Category 
			A by agreement of the parties;
	Category B =	system sub-assemblies and ASICs;
	Category C =	all other components and materials.
	
	Upon repricing, a net adjustment will be made, by invoice to the 
	appropriate party, to revalue on-hand inventory.  Where, despite SCI's 
	efforts, a supplier refuses to revalue on-order inventory effective 
	immediately, the net adjustment will include those on-order units as well.
	
	Upon request, SCI will provide Apple the actual cost of specified 
	materials used in its Products.  With advance notice to SCI, Apple may 
	renegotiate the price of any component or material, and/or delivery or 
	other terms, with suppliers at any time.  SCI will pass through to 
	Apple, according to the above schedule, any cost reductions, including 
	any rebates, discounts or other value received by SCI in connection 
	with any component purchased for use in Apple's products or by 
	leveraging Apple's volumes.  Failure to do so will constitute a 
	material breach and grounds for immediate termination, except for de 
	minimus or accidental errors which are promptly remedied with interest 
	(not to exceed 1% per month on all amounts not remedied within 15 
	days).

10.5	Tooling and NRE Costs.  SCI will quote tooling, NRE, and other one time 
	costs separately, and will not incur any such cost without Apple's 
	prior written approval.  Apple will pay only those tooling costs and 
	NRE actually incurred by SCI, without markup, and will have the option 
	to amortize its payments over a reasonable period of time or number of 
	units to be agreed by the parties.  SCI will substantiate all such 
	costs, which will not exceed the initial agreed estimate unless due to 
	changes requested by Apple.

10.6	Product Cost Reviews.

	(a)	Apple and SCI will agree upon cost reduction goals with stair 
		step costs reductions to be implemented over an agreed upon 
		period of time.  These goals will be set forth in the Product 
		Plan.
	
	(b)	SCI will meet with Apple every three (3) months during the Term	 
		to review the existing Product cost and establish a plan to 
		pursue all reasonable cost reduction opportunities.  

10.7	Most Favored Customer Pricing.  SCI hereby warrants that at no time 
	will the prices charged Apple for any Product under this Agreement 
	exceed the prices offered other customers on similar terms and 	
	conditions.

					100
<PAGE>


10.8	Taxes.  The prices set forth in the Price Schedules are exclusive of 
	state or local sales, use, excise or similar taxes, which, if 
	applicable, will be paid by Apple.  

10.9	Reports.  SCI will provide Apple monthly reports within ten (10) 
	business days after the end of each month, and quarterly reports within
	ten (10) business days after the end of each of calendar quarter 
	showing:  (i) the number of Standard Labor Hours actually expended at 
	Fountain for third parties during such month or quarter; and (ii) the 
	number of Mac OS Systems and boards for Mac OS Systems manufactured at 
	Fountain for third parties during such month or quarter.  

10.10	Royalties.  Unless stated otherwise in a Product Plan, SCI will have no
 	obligation to collect and pay separate royalties to any third party 
	(except those royalties contained within a vendor's product price).

11.	FORECASTS, ORDERS & ADJUSTMENTS

11.1	Forecasts.  Apple will provide SCI, every calendar month during the 	
	Term, a forecast covering the period of six (6) calendar months 
	beginning with the month in which such forecast is provided.  Such 	
	forecast will specify the number of units of the Products which Apple 
	anticipates purchasing during such six (6) month period.  Such 
	forecasts will be non-binding and will not be regarded as a commitment	
	to purchase by either party. 

11.2	Purchase Orders.  Apple will order Products by issuing monthly Purchase
 	Orders to SCI on a rolling four month basis, in writing or by 
	electronic means, in accordance with the applicable Lead Time(s).  To 
	be effective, all Purchase Orders must reference this Agreement and 
	contain the following terms, summary of initial P.O. attached as 
	Exhibit _________.

	(a)	description of the Products to be purchased, including Apple's 
		part number; 

	(b)	quantity to be purchased; 
	
	(c)	delivery instructions, including routing, delivery schedule and 
		destination; and
	
	(d)	confirmation of price.
	
	SCI will accept Apple Purchase Orders within five (5) working days 
	after it receives them.  Failure to deliver an acknowledgment to Apple 
	within such five (5) day period will be deemed acceptance.  Only terms 
	(a) - (d), above, and the terms of this Agreement will apply to orders 
	for Products, even if Apple's Purchase Order and/or SCI's 
	acknowledgment form contains other terms and conditions.  In the case 
	of conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of
	this Agreement will prevail.  Any remedies at law or equity not 
	specifically disclaimed or modified by this Agreement remain available 
	to both parties.

					101
<PAGE>


11.3	Authorized Purchasing Locations.  SCI agrees to accept and act upon 
	only those Purchase Orders received from the following authorized 
	purchasing locations:
	
	Apple Computer, Inc.		Apple Computer Limited
	One Infinite Loop		Holly Hill Industrial Estate
	Cupertino, CA 95014		Cork City, Ireland

	Campbell, CA  95008
	
	The above list of authorized purchasing locations may revised by Apple 
	from time to time by written notice to SCI.

11.4	Order Adjustments.
	Apple may increase, decrease or reschedule the number of units under a 
	particular purchase order as follows: 
	
	For PCBA Orders:
		Adjustments Made	Permissible Adjustment*
		Within 30 Days* 	up to 25%
		31 to 45 Days 		up to 50%
		46 to 60 Days 		up to 75%
		60+ Days 		up to 100%+

					102
<PAGE>

	For FATP Orders:
		Adjustments Made	Permissible Adjustment**
		Within 7 Days*:		negotiated
		8 to 14 Days 		up to 25% 
		15 to 21 Days 		up to 50% 
		22+ Days 		up to 100%+

	*	"Days" means the number of calendar days between Apple's order 
		adjustment and the scheduled Delivery date.

	** 	"Adjustment" means the percentage of units ordered for Delivery 
		on such Delivery Date that Apple may add to the order, delete 
		from the order or reschedule for later delivery.  
	
	Contingent on availability of materials and labor, SCI will supply 
	increased units on the originally scheduled Delivery date.  
	
	If Apple reschedules the Delivery date under a particular Purchase 
	Order more than sixty (60) days after the original Delivery date, Apple
	will pay SCI an inventory carrying charge equal to 1% of the actual 
	cost of affected inventory held by SCI on the last day of each month 
	thereafter, provided that SCI will use every effort to mitigate such 
	carrying charges to Apple by, without limitation, canceling or delaying 
	orders, returning components and utilizing components in other products 
	currently produced by SCI at any of its sites.
	
	Apple will be responsible for:

	(i)	any overtime charges required to meet Apple's needs where Apple 
		requires greater flexibility than is permitted above; and

	(ii)	any vendor premiums required to meet Apple's flexibility needs, 
		provided that such premiums are incurred due to circumstances 
		beyond SCI's control; provided that SCI will use every effort 
		to minimize such charges or premiums and will advise Apple of 
		any such charges or premiums in advance so that Apple may 
		choose whether to incur the additional cost in order to achieve 
		the desired flexibility.

11.5	Configuration Changes.  Subject to availability of materials, Apple may 
	change the configuration of quantities under a particular Purchase Order 
	at any time without penalty; provided that SCI may adjust the cost of 
	such quantities pursuant to the terms of Section 10, above. 
					
					103
<PAGE>


11.6	Cancellation of Purchase Orders. Apple may cancel any Purchase 
	Order(s), in whole or in part, on thirty (30) days notice to SCI, 
	provided that Apple will reimburse SCI for costs actually and 
	reasonably incurred by SCI, including the actual cost of materials and
	components for the ordered quantity and material adders therefore (as 
	set forth in Exhibit B "Other Cost Adders"), as the result of such 
	cancellation, but not profit or opportunity cost.  Both parties will 
	undertake reasonable measures to mitigate the costs of termination.

11.7	Lead Time Reduction Program.  SCI and Apple will meet periodically to 
	discuss options to effect reductions in Lead Times to allow improved 
	flexibility in ordering and delivery.  The agenda for each meeting will
	include identification of such options, schedules for determination of 
	associated cost and schedules for implementation. 


12.	DELIVERY, TITLE, CARRIER & RISK OF LOSS

12.1	Delivery.  SCI will Deliver the total number of units ordered in a 
	particular Purchase Order to the Delivery Point on or before the date 
	specified in such Purchase Order, subject to the provisions of Section 
	11.4 above.   

12.2	Carrier; Risk of Loss.  SCI will use Apple's Preferred Carrier(s) for 
	Delivery, provided that if Apple does not designate a preferred 
	carrier, SCI may select a common carrier at its discretion.  All 
	shipments will be FOB point of shipment, with title and risk of loss or 
	damage passing to Apple upon Delivery to the Delivery Point.

12.3	Failure to Meet Delivery Date.    

	In addition, and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies 
	available to Apple under law or otherwise:

	(a)	If a Delivery is or will be late by one or more days, provided 
		late delivery was not caused by Apple, SCI will pay the 
		incremental cost associated with air freighting the order to 
		Apple. 

	(b)	If SCI fails to Deliver all or part of any order within five 
		(5) days after the Delivery date specified in the Purchase 
		Order, Apple may, without prejudice to any other rights or 
		remedies available to Apple under law or otherwise, terminate 
		the late portion of the Purchase Order without cancellation 
		charges.  The canceled units will be credited against Apple's 
		Percentage Volume Commitment.  With respect to the portion of 
		a Purchase Order not terminated, if any, the unit price will 
		not change and SCI will otherwise continue performance under 
		this Agreement.

	(c)	If SCI fails to deliver all or part of an order within thirty 
		(30) days after the Delivery date specified in the Purchase 
		Order, Apple may, without prejudice to any other rights or 
		remedies available to Apple under law or otherwise, terminate	

						104
<PAGE>

	 	the Purchase Order without cancellation charges and purchase 
		substitute products from another source; provided that, prior 
		to such cancellation, Apple will provide SCI the opportunity to
	 	manufacture and deliver the Product within thirty (30) days 
		from any other SCI facility or to subcontract the effort to 
		another source approved by Apple for delivery within such 
		thirty (30) day period.  SCI will reimburse Apple for the 
		difference between the price of the products and the price paid
		by Apple for substituted products.  Any such substitute 
		products will be credited against Apple's Percentage Volume 
		Commitments.  With respect to the portion of a Purchase Order 
		not terminated, if any, the unit price will not change and SCI 
		will otherwise continue performance under this Agreement.   

13.	PAYMENTS

Apple will pay SCI for quantities of Product Delivered to Apple net thirty (30) 
days from the date of SCI's invoice, provided that the date of the invoice will 
be no earlier than the Delivery date for such quantities.  Apple's payment of 
SCI's invoice will not constitute final acceptance of the Product and is 
subject to adjustments for errors, shortages and defects.  Unless otherwise 
agreed by the parties, payment will be made by telegraphic transfer to a bank 
account designated by SCI.  Neither party will have the right of offset of set 
off.  At its option, five (5) working days after written notice to Apple, SCI 
may impose a late payment fee of up to one percent (1%) per month on all 
amounts past due by more than fifteen (15) days.  Both parties agree to work 
diligently to resolve any discrepancies involving invoices.

14.	SERVICE UNITS, SPARE PARTS & SERVICE DOCUMENTATION

14.1	Purchase of Spare Parts and Service Units.  Apple or its designee may 
	purchase Service Units and Spare Parts during the period beginning at 
	the Product's initial production and ending seven (7) years after SCI's	
	last shipment of such Product to Apple (even if after expiration of the 
	Agreement).  Such purchases will be governed by the applicable terms 
	and conditions of this Agreement.  Lead Times for Service Units and 
	Spare Parts during production will be no greater than the then 
	prevailing Lead Time for the Product.  In an emergency, SCI will, 
	contingent on availability of labor and components,  Deliver Service 
	Units and Spare Parts for Products in production within three (3) days; 
	provided that SCI will advise Apple of any cost, schedule or other 
	impact of such short lead time in advance of Delivery and will not 
	Deliver such Service Units or Spare Parts unless Apple approves such 
	impact in writing.  Apple acknowledges that after production, Lead 
	Times for such Service Units and Spare Parts may increase, though they 
	will at all times during such period be reasonable given the 
	availability of materials and labor.  

14.2	Allocation of Components.  If SCI does not have sufficient inventory of
	Procured Materials to satisfy Apple's Purchase Orders for Service Units
	and Spare Parts and open Purchase Order for Products, Apple may divert 
	components allocated for production of Products and Service Units to 
	Spare Parts production.   The extent such diversion of components 
	causes additional actual labor cost to SCI and/or scheduled delivery 
	delays, such impacts will be equitably negotiated between the parties. 

					105
<PAGE>


14.3	Tear-Down of Completed Product.  If after a reasonable attempt to re-
	allocate components pursuant to Section 14.2 above, Apple is required 
	to tear down completed Product or Service Units to obtain Spare Parts 
	to repair units in the field, SCI will accept return of the incomplete 
	Products or Service Units, freight collect, to SCI's designated repair 
	facilities, promptly repair the units and return the units to Apple 
	freight prepaid.  Apple will be obligated to pay SCI the reasonable 
	costs incurred by SCI in making the repairs, including SCI's freight 
	cost and profit as set forth in Exhibit B.

14.4	Packaging.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Service Units will 
	be packaged with electronic static discharge protection and will be 
	individually packaged in accordance with Apple's Packaging 
	Specification (P/N 062-0087) attached as a part of Exhibit A.  Unless 
	otherwise agreed by the parties, all other Spare Parts will be packaged 
	in bulk form with Apple's Spare Part description, part number, and 
	quantity identification on the outside of a bulk container approved by 
	Apple.  SCI will provide one packing slip for each shipment of Service 
	Units and Spare Parts on Purchase Orders submitted by Apple.  This 
	packing slip will be located on the outside of each shipping box and 
	will list:  (a) Apple's and SCI's part number and the quantity for each 
	Service Unit and Spare Part shipped; and (b) the Purchase Order number.  
	The Purchase Order number should also appear on the shipping label for 
	each separate carton shipped, and all packages of individual Service 
	Units and Spare Parts in a carton should be clearly indicated and 
	marked with Apple's part number.

14.5	Service Documentation and Tools.  SCI will provide Apple reasonably 
	complete and accurate Service Documentation as specified in the Product
	Plan to assist Apple or an approved third party in the preparation of 
	materials for servicing, repairing and inspecting the Products.  SCI 
	will also provide Apple any Service Software or other tools or fixtures 
	specified by the parties in the Product Plan, provided that Apple may 
	be required to pay for materials and components used in such tools or 
	fixtures at prices set forth in such in such Product Plan. 

15.	WARRANTIES

15.1	Pass Through Warranties:  SCI will purchase and pass through to Apple 
	material and workmanship warranties on Procured Materials specified by 
	Apple in the Product Plan, including without limitation product 
	liability warranties, so that Apple may, at its option, take warranty 
	claims directly to the vendors of such Procured Materials, rather than 
	make such claims through SCI.  If such action by Apple will impact SCI's 
	cost or delivery schedule, such cost or schedule will be equitably 
	adjusted.   SCI will also establish a process permitting Apple to 
	purchase components and materials and procure out-of-warranty repairs 
	directly from such vendors.  Such vendors will keep SCI apprised of 
	Apple's returns and business requirements.  Apple's direct relationship 
	with any such vendor will not release SCI from any of its obligations 
	under this Agreement.  

					106
<PAGE>


15.2	Epidemic Failure Warranty.  If a Product demonstrates an Epidemic 
	Failure within three (3) years of the date of manufacture, SCI will 	
	promptly repair the affected Product or Service Unit, replace it with 
	a functionally equivalent product or service unit, or credit Apple an 
	amount equal to the purchase price.  SCI will also (i) pay freight in 
	and out; and (ii) reimburse Apple for reasonable direct costs 
	associated with the Epidemic Failure, including without limitation 
	labor costs associated with diagnostics, removal of Service Units and 
	repair or replacement by Apple or Apple's service provider.
	
	The Formula for determining when an Epidemic Failure  is set forth in 
	the Product Plan for each Product attached to Exhibit A.

	Apple will notify SCI whenever an Epidemic Failure is identified or 
	suspected and work with SCI to develop a recovery plan, which may 
	include a preventative action plan if appropriate under the 
	circumstances.  The recovery plan actually implemented by Apple is in 
	Apple's sole discretion; provided, however that (i) Apple and SCI will 
	work together to minimize costs associated with Apple's recovery plan 
	as much as possible without compromising Apple's ability to 
	aggressively respond to its customer's needs; and (ii) SCI will 
	reimburse Apple only for reasonable direct costs incurred by Apple in 
	implementing that portion of the recovery plan associated with the 
	Epidemic Failure.   SCI shall not be responsible for Epidemic Failures 
	caused by Apple's specifications, instructions, drawings, or designs. 

15.3	Optional Product Warranty.

	In addition to the Epidemic Failure warranty provided under Section 
	15.1, above, Apple will have the option to purchase a fifteen (15) 
	month warranty of materials and workmanship (a "Product Warranty") for
 	any or all Products under this Agreement at a price not to exceed one-
	half of one percent (.5%) of the unit price of the warranted Product.  
	Apple may exercise its option to purchase a Product Warranty for a 
	particular Product by giving notice to SCI at any time before such 
	Product is shipped to Apple.  The agreed price of the Product Warranty 
	will be set forth in the Product Plan for such Product.  

	SCI represents and warrants to Apple that each Product for which Apple 
	purchases a Product Warranty (a "Warranted Product") will be free from 
	defects in workmanship and materials for fifteen (15) months from the 
	date SCI shipped such Product to Apple.  The Product Warranty will not 
	apply to any Warranted Product that has been abused, damaged, altered 
	or misused by someone other than SCI or that is defective as a result 
	of causes external to the Product and not caused by SCI or caused by 
	Apple supplied materials.  A Warranted Product will be considered to 
	be free from defects in workmanship if it was manufactured in 
	accordance with SCI's manufacturing workmanship standards and conforms 
	to the Specifications and Quality Requirements for such Warranted 
	Product.  

15.4 	Repair Under Product Warranty.  If SCI breaches the Product Warranty, 
	Apple may return the defective subassembly/field replaceable unit to 
	SCI for prompt repair or for replacement with a functionally equivalent

					107
<PAGE>

	 subassembly or field replacement unit, at SCI's option.  SCI will 
	issue a return authorization to Apple within two (2) days after receipt
 	of Apple's warranty claim.  Apple will return such Product, freight 
	prepaid, to the factory or service center designated by SCI in its 
	return authorization.  SCI will promptly repair or replace such units 
	at SCI's expense and deliver the repaired or replaced units to Apple 
	FOB destination, freight prepaid by SCI.  Repaired or replaced Product 
	will carry the same Product Warranty for the balance of the original 
	warranty period.  If SCI is unable to repair or replace a unit within 
	forty five (45) days of receipt, SCI will refund to Apple the purchase 
	price for that unit unless Apple has approved a repair or replacement 
	after such forty five (45) day period.  SCI may sell any units repaired 
	after such forty five (45) day period to Apple to fulfill Apple's 
	P.O.'s for Service Units or Spare Parts.

15.5	Tracking Product and Epidemic Failure Warranties.  SCI will (i) develop
	and maintain a system for tracking the date each unit of each Product 
	was manufactured and shipped to Apple so that the parties may identify 
	Product covered by the Product Warranty and the Epidemic Failure 
	Warranty; and (ii) make such information available to Apple upon 
	Apple's request.  SCI's tracking system will be subject to Apple's 
	approval and will be maintained at least one-hundred and twenty (120)
	days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.

15.6	Regulatory Compliance.  SCI will comply with all applicable laws and 
	regulations in performing its services under this Agreement.

15.7	Notice of Non Compliance.  If SCI discovers or suspects that any Apple 
	Product fails to comply with any applicable consumer product or 
	electrical safety rule or contains a defect that could create a 
	substantial product or electrical hazard, SCI will notify Apple 
	immediately and supply Apple with information concerning the nature and 
	extent of the defect involved and the nature and severity of injuries 
	or potential injuries related to the particular Product.  SCI will 
	notify Apple immediately of any claim made or proceeding commenced a
	gainst it arising out of its activities under this Agreement. 

15.8	Limitation of Warranty.  
	
	(a)	All claims for breach of Product Warranty or Epidemic Failure 
		Warranty must be received by SCI no later than thirty (30) 
		days after the expiration of the warranty period;

	(b)	THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES GIVEN 
		BY SCI.  SCI MAKES, AND APPLE RECEIVES, NO OTHER WARRANTY 
		EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
		OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE ARE EXPRESSLY 
		DISCLAIMED AND EXCLUDED.

	(c)	UNLESS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO BY SCI IN WRITING, SCI MAKES NO 
		WARRANTY THAT A PRODUCT WILL (I) MEET ANY SPECIFICATION NOT

					108
<PAGE>

		CERTIFIED BY UNDERWRITERS LABORATORY, ANY FEDERAL, STATE, 
		LOCAL OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AGENCY (INCLUDING WITHOUT 
		LIMITATION THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION) OR ANY 
		OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY.  COMPANY ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY 
		FOR OBTAINING SUCH APPROVALS OR CERTIFICATIONS, OR FOR 
		MEETING ANY SPECIFICATIONS BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN APPLE'S 
		SPECIFICATIONS.

15.9	No Waiver.  Apple's approval or acceptance of any Products which do not 
	meet the Specifications will not relieve SCI of its warranty 
	obligations under this Section 15.

15.10	Apple warrants the accuracy and completeness of the drawings, 
	specifications and documentation provided to SCI for the manufacture of
	components and products.

16.	INDEMNIFICATION

16.1	Indemnity by SCI.  SCI will, at SCI's expense, indemnify, hold harmless 
	and, at Apple's request, defend Apple any of its subsidiaries, 
	affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and independent 
	contractors, from and against any and all loss, cost, liability or 
	expense (including costs and reasonable fees of attorneys and other 
	professionals) arising out of or in connection with a third party claim
	that: (i) a Product caused injury or damage to a person or property; or
 	(ii) that a Product, material or component provided or procured by SCI, 
	or SCI's manufacturing process infringes any patent, copyright, trade 
	mark right, trade secret, mask work right or other proprietary right of
 	any third party; provided, however, that SCI will have no liability 
	under this Section 16.1 to the extent such infringement is attributable
	to the incorporation of designs or materials provided by Apple into the 
	Product.

16.2	Indemnity by Apple.  Apple will, at Apple's expense, indemnify, hold 
	harmless and, at SCI's request, defend SCI any of its subsidiaries, 
	affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and independent 
	contractors, from and against any and all loss, cost, liability or 
	expense (including costs and reasonable fees of attorneys and other 
	professionals) arising out of or in connection with a third party claim	
	that a Product infringes any patent, copyright, trade mark right, trade 
	secret, mask work right or other proprietary right of any third party 
	to the extent that such claim is attributable to SCI's incorporation 
	of designs or materials provided by Apple into the Product.  

16.3	Legal Compliance.  Each party will defend, indemnify, and hold the 
	other party harmless from any loss, cost, or expense directly 
	resulting from the first party's violation of any law, rule, regulation
 	or ordinance of the United States, any state, or any other governmental 
	agency in the performance of this Agreement.  

16.4	Conditions.  A party's obligation to indemnify the other under this 
	Section 16 is conditioned upon and subject to:  (a) the indemnified 
	party giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt notice in writing
	of any such suit and permits the indemnifying party through counsel of 
	its choice, to answer the charge of infringement and defend such claim 
	or suit; (b) the indemnified party provides the indemnifying party

					109
<PAGE>

	information, assistance and authority, at the indemnifying party's 
	expense, to enable such party to defend the suit; and (c) the 
	indemnifying party will not be responsible for any settlement made 
	by indemnified party without its prior written consent.  The 
	indemnifying party agrees not to disclose or publicize the terms of
	any settlement of a suit against the indemnified party without first 
	obtaining the such party's written permission.

17.	CONFIDENTIALITY

	Each party will protect the other's Confidential Information from 
	unauthorized dissemination and use with the same degree of care that
	each such party uses to protect its own like information, but at a 
	minimum, with a reasonable degree of care.  Neither party will use the 
	other's Confidential Information for purposes other than those 
	necessary to perform this Agreement and only employees of the receiving
 	party who have a need to know such Confidential Information will have 
	access thereto.  Neither party will disclose to third parties the 
	other's Confidential Information without the prior written consent of 
	the other party.

18.	TERMINATION

18.1	Termination for Cause.  
	
	(a)	Either party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately 
		upon written notice to the other (i) for a material breach by 
		such other party not cured within thirty (30) days after written 
		notice of such breach; or (ii) if the other party admits in 
		writing its insolvency or inability to pay its debts or perform 
		its obligations as they mature or makes an assignment for the 
		benefit of creditors, or a receiver or similar officer is 
		appointed to take charge of all or a portion of the parties 
		assets.  
	(b)	Apple may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon 
		written notice to SCI if SCI materially breaches its obligation 
		of confidentiality under Section 17.

18.2	Termination Without Cause.  After the Initial Term, but not during such 
	Term, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause by giving 
	the other ninety (90) days advance written notice.

18.3	Effect of Termination For Cause.  Upon termination of this Agreement:
	
	(i)	SCI will, to the extent and at times specified by Apple, stop 
		all work on outstanding Purchase Orders, incur no further 
		direct costs, and protect all property in which Apple has or 
		may acquire an interest.  Apple will have the option to request 
		that SCI complete work in progress pursuant to any Purchase 
		Orders open on the date of termination;

	(ii)	Apple will compensate SCI for all Product delivered and accepted 
		by Apple; and

					110
<PAGE>


	(iii)	SCI will deliver to Apple and Apple will purchase from SCI, at 
		SCI's Standard Cost, any usable Unique Components in SCI's 
		inventory of the date of termination that were purchased to 
		fulfill firm Purchase Orders or pursuant to a Letter of 
		Authorization from Apple.
	
	(iv)	Each party will return to the other, freight collect, all 
		materials that contain the other's Confidential Information, 
		or if the other party gives written instructions to do so, 
		destroy all such materials and provide the other a written 
		certificate of destruction within thirty (30) days after such 
		destruction; 
	
	Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the obligations of 
	the parties under Sections 1, 3.4, will remain in effect.

18.4	Inventory Indemnification.

	18.4.1	Upon expiration of this Agreement or termination of this 
		Agreement for cause by SCI or for convenience by Apple after 
		the Initial Term, Apple will be responsible for:

		(i)	all work-in-process at receipt of the notice of 
			termination or intent not to renew; and 

		(ii)	all procured materials purchased to fill a Purchase 
			Order or authorized by Apple in a letter of 
			Authorization to be purchased by Customer which are on
 			hand or on order at receipt of the notice of 
			termination or intent not to renew.  Items (i) and (ii)
			are referred to as the "Termination Inventory".

	18.4.2	SCI will make every reasonable effort to use the Termination 
		Inventory on other current customer programs, will cancel all 
		outstanding material orders with vendors, and will attempt to 
		return piece parts to vendors with Apple's prior approval.  
		Apple will be responsible for costs, charges and fees actually 
		incurred by SCI to cancel or return any portion of the 
		Termination Inventory to vendors and, upon mutual agreement, 
		the cost to modify the procured material for other programs.

	18.4.3	With thirty (30) days from termination or cancellation, SCI 
		will invoice, and Apple will purchase, the Termination 
		Inventory remaining after vendor cancellations and returns and 
		after other program use, as follows:  (i) for Procured Material
	 	Inventory and authorized long lead time components, at SCI's 
		standard cost, plus a reasonable handling charge; (ii) for WIP,
		at a reasonable pro rata percentage of the finished Product 
		purchase price; and (iii) for finished Product, at the purchase 
		price in effect at termination or cancellation.  With Apple's 
		prior approval, Apple will be responsible for any substantiated
		negative price differential between the price SCI paid for the 
		Procured Material and authorized long lead time components and 
		the price at which SCI was able to return and/or utilize the 
		items on other programs.  SCI will credit Customer for any 
		positive price differentials.

	License.

19.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT PURSUANT TO SECTION 16 (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER 
PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, 
EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, 
TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
PROFITS AND OPPORTUNITY DAMAGE TO ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT, COST OF 
CAPITAL, FACILITIES, SERVICE, OR REPLACEMENT POWER, DOWNTIME COSTS, OR 
CLAIMS OF EITHER PARTY'S CUSTOMERS FOR SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT

20.	PROPERTY FURNISHED BY APPLE

Apple will retain title to and beneficial ownership of any tools, dies, molds, 
jigs, patterns, hobs, computer equipment, electrodes, punches, artwork, 
screens, tapes, templates, machinery, test equipment, fixtures, gauges, Apple 
Proprietary Technology, Specifications, drawings or other documents or data 
furnished, paid for or charged to Apple.  While in SCI's possession, SCI will 
hold such property in trust for Apple and maintain and preserve such property 
for Apple's benefit for a period of seven (7) years following termination of 
this Agreement.  SCI will clearly mark all of Apple's property its possession 
"Property of Apple Computer, Inc." (or substantially similar marking) and will
not use such property for any purpose other than to perform the services under 
this Agreement without Apple's prior consent.  SCI will keep an up to date 
inventory of all Apple property in its possession and provide a copy to Apple 
upon Apple's request.  Apple may, on forty-eight (48) hours prior notice, 
require that SCI return some or all of such property and, if it does so, SCI 
will immediately deliver all such property to Apple or, in Apple's discretion, 
permit Apple to take possession of such property wherever it is situated.  If 
Apple requires that SCI return of any Apple-owned property that is required to 
manufacture and deliver a Product, SCI will be relieved of its obligation to 
supply such Product to Apple.

21.	EXPORT/IMPORT COMPLIANCE 

21.1	Export Controlled Commodities, Technical Data and Software.  This 
	Agreement is subject to all laws, regulations, orders or other 
	limitations on the export and re-export of commodities, technical data
 	and software.  The parties hereby agrees that they will not export, 
	re-export, resell or transfer any export controlled commodity, 
	technical data or software (i) in violation of such limitations imposed
 	by the United States or any other appropriate national government 
	authority, or (ii) to any country for which an export license or other 
	governmental approval is required at the time of export, without first 
	obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals.  SCI will make 
	records of all export transactions available to Apple upon Apple's 
	written request in order to permit Apple to confirm SCI's compliance 
	with its obligations under this Section.

					112
<PAGE>


21.2	Exporter of Record.  Unless the parties agree otherwise in the Product 
	Plan for particular Product(s), Apple will be the Exporter of Record 
	for all such Products manufactured at Fountain and Delivered to Apple 
	or its designee outside of the United States.  The Exporter of Record 
	will be responsible for obtaining necessary export licenses and other 
	government approvals required for export, and for preparing export 
	documentation such as commercial invoices, shipper's export 
	declarations, and international waybills.  Each party agrees to comply
	fully with the export control laws of the United States and with the 
	U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the U.S. Arms Export Control 
	Act when acting as the Exporter of Record.

21.3	Certificates of Delivery.  Upon Apple's request and at SCI's expense, 
	SCI will provide Apple:  (i) Certificates of Delivery to Apple for 
	Products imported into the United States by SCI and Delivered to Apple 
	in the United States as imported goods; and (ii) Certificates of 
	Manufacture and Delivery for Products imported and then further 
	manufactured by SCI and Delivered to Apple in the United States as 
	imported goods.  Each Certificate will describe the imported 
	merchandise and reference both Apple's and SCI's Part Numbers.  Apple 
	will use the Certificates only for the purpose of obtaining duty  
	drawbacks. 

21.4	Country of Origin Marking.  SCI certifies that articles manufactured 
	by SCI, or repacked by SCI, will conform with the U.S. Customs Marking 
	requirements as stated 19 U.S.C. 1304 and 19 CFR Part 134.

21.5	NAFTA.  SCI agrees to review, upon Apple's request, North American Free 
	Trade Agreement (NAFTA) eligibility of products or material shipped 
	directly from SCI to NAFTA qualifying country (eg:  U.S., Canada or 
	Mexico).  Apple agrees to cooperate in providing information reasonably 
	required by SCI to evaluate NAFTA eligibility of Products.  When 
	products are shipped directly from SCI's facility to a qualifying NAFTA
 	country, SCI will generate the supporting NAFTA certificate of origin 
	for the importer in such qualifying country.  In addition, SCI agrees 
	maintain documentation in support of all NAFTA certificates issued.  
	When goods are shipped to an Apple facility in the U.S., SCI agrees to 
	supply Apple, upon Apple's request, with a statement of NAFTA 
	qualification and maintain documentation in support of such statement.

22.	GENERAL TERMS

22.1	Force Majeure.  Neither party will be deemed in default of this 
	Agreement to the extent that performance of its obligations or attempts
 	to cure any breach are delayed or prevented by reason of any act of 
	God, fire, natural disaster, accident, act of government, or an act 
	that is beyond the reasonable control of either party, provided that 
	such party gives the other party written notice thereof promptly and, 
	in any event, within fifteen (15) days of discovery thereof and uses 
	its best efforts to continue to so perform or cure. In the event of 
	such a Force Majeure, the time for performance or cure will be extended
 	for a period equal to the duration of the Force Majeure, but in no 
	event more than thirty (30) days.

	advertisements or Exhibitions.

22.7	Publicity.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, no press

	be in writing, will reference this Agreement and will be deemed given 
	when: (i) delivered personally; (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or

	or written, between the parties. No amendment to or modification of 
	this Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly 
	authorized representative of both parties.

APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1.	Interim information is unaudited; however, in the opinion of the 
Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of interim
results have been included.  All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature 
unless specified in a separate note included in these Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.  The results for interim periods are not necessarily 
indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.  These financial 
statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's annual
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year 
ended September 29, 1995, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended September 29, 1995 (the "1995 Form 10-K").

2.	In the third quarter of 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate
principal amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the "Notes") 
to certain qualified parties in a private placement.  The Notes were sold at 
100% of par.  The Notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001.  
The Notes are convertible by their holders at any time after September 5, 1996 
at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to adjustments as defined in 
the Note agreement.  The Notes are redeemable by the Company at 102.4% of the 
principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 12-month period beginning June 
1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 
12-month period beginning June 1, 2000.  The Notes are subordinated to all 
present and future senior indebtedness of the Company as defined in the Note 
agreement.  In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million of 
costs associated with the issuance of the Notes.  These costs are accounted for
as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and will be amortized over the 
life of the Notes.   

3.	In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to 
implement a restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs and restoring 
profitability to the Company's operations.  The restructuring plan was 
necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the Company's 
adoption of a new strategic direction.  The Company's restructuring actions 
consist primarily of terminating approximately 2,800 full-time employees (not 
including employees who were hired by SCI Systems, Inc., the purchaser of the 
Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility), canceling or vacating 
certain facility leases as a result of these employee terminations, writing 
down operating assets to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and 
outsourcing various operational functions, and canceling contracts as a result 
of terminating eWorld(trademark), Apple's on-line service.  These actions have
resulted in a charge of $207 million, including cash expenditures of $44 
million and non-cash asset write-downs of $4 million, through the third 
quarter.  The Company expects that the remaining $159 million accrued balance 
at June 28, 1996 will result in cash expenditures of $103 million over the next 
12 months and $12 million thereafter.  The Company expects that most of the 
contemplated restructuring actions will be completed within the next twelve 
months and will be financed through current working capital and continued 
short-term borrowings.  In addition, in connection with the sale of its 
Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility, the Company is obligated to purchase 
certain percentages of its total annual volumes of CPUs and logic boards from 
SCI Systems, Inc. over each of the next three years.   The Company believes 
that it 
will meet these obligations.


The following table depicts the restructuring activity through the third 
quarter of 1996:  (In millions)

5.	The Company's cash equivalents consist primarily of U.S. Government 
securities, Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper with maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term investments consisted 
principally of Euro-dollar deposits and commercial paper with maturities 
between three and twelve months.  The Company's marketable equity securities 
consist of securities issued by U.S. corporations and are included in "Other 
assets" on the accompanying balance sheet.  The Company's cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, and marketable equity securities are classified and 
accounted for as available-for-sale,  and the cash equivalents and short-term 
investments are generally held until maturity.   The Company's cash and cash 
equivalent balance includes $173 million pledged as collateral to support 
letters of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments 
under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing 
facility to SCI Systems, Inc.
	
	The adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding 
gains (losses) on available-for-sale cash equivalents and marketable equity 
securities were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, at June 
28, 1996.  The gross realized gains recorded to earnings on sales of available-
for-sale securities were $69 million and $71 million for the three and nine 
months ended June 28, 1996, respectively.

6.	U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $395 
million of undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign 
subsidiaries.  It is intended that these earnings will be indefinitely invested 
in operations outside of the United States.  It is not practicable to determine 
the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be 
distributed.  Except for such indefinitely invested earnings, the Company 
provides for federal and state income taxes currently on undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries. 

	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax 
deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain 
prepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies for the 
years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these years have 
been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency 
proposing increases in the amount of the Company's federal income taxes for the 
years 1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a petition with the United 
States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management 
believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may 
result from these tax examinations. 

7.	Earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of 
common and dilutive common equivalent shares attributable to stock options 
outstanding during the period.  Loss per share is computed using the weighted 
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

8.	Certain prior year amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

9.	No dividend has been declared for the third quarter of 1996, and the 
Board of Directors anticipates that for the foreseeable future the Company will
retain any earnings for use in the operation of its business. 

10.	The information set forth in Item 1 of Part II hereof is hereby 
incorporated by reference.

Overview

Over the last six months the Company has experienced a significant decline in 
net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer market.  For the 
quarter ended June 28, 1996, the number of the Company's Macintosh computers 
shipped worldwide declined by 16% when compared with  the corresponding quarter
of 1995.  Moreover, according to an industry source, in the third quarter of 
1996 as compared to  the third quarter of 1995, the Company's share of the 
worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.3% from 7.4%, and to
7.4% from 10.6%, respectively.  This decline in demand, coupled with intense 
price competition throughout the industry, has resulted in the Company's 
decision to develop and announce key elements of a new strategic direction 
intended to improve the Company's competitiveness and restore its 
profitability.  The Company intends to develop and market products and services
more selectively targeted to education, home and business segments.  In moving 
in this new strategic direction, the Company expects to reduce the number of 
new product introductions and the number of products in certain categories 
within its current product portfolio.

Net Sales

Net sales for the third quarter of 1996 decreased when compared with the 
corresponding quarter of 1995, resulting from a decrease in Macintosh
(registered trademark) computer net sales and in net sales of peripheral 
products such as displays and printers.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales 
decreased 16% in the third quarter when compared with the corresponding 
quarter of 1995, primarily as a result of a decline in worldwide demand for 
most product families, primarily entry level products, due principally to 
customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial 
condition and future prospects, and as a result of delays in the shipment of 
certain Powerbook products due to quality problems.  The average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit decreased 8% in the third quarter when 
compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995, primarily due to pricing 
actions across all product lines in order to stimulate demand, partially 
offset by increased revenues from a shift in the mix towards the Company's 
newer products and products with multi-media configurations, which have higher 
average selling prices.

Net sales for the first nine months of 1996 decreased when compared with the 
first nine months of 1995, resulting from a decrease in Macintosh computer net 
sales and in net sales of peripheral products such as displays and printers.  
Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 5% in the first nine months of 
1996, when compared with the corresponding period of 1995.  Unit sales 
increased in the first quarter of 1996 when compared with the corresponding 
quarter of 1995, but were more than offset by unit sales decreases in the 
second and third quarters of 1996 when compared with the corresponding quarters
of 1995.  The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit did not 
change in the first nine months of 1996, when compared with the corresponding 
period of 1995 primarily due to increased revenues from a shift in the mix 
towards the Company's newer products and products with multi-media 
configurations, which have higher average selling prices, offset by pricing 
actions across all product lines in order to stimulate demand.

International net sales decreased 9% in the third quarter and did not change 
in the first nine months of 1996, respectively, when compared with the 
corresponding periods of 1995. The decrease in the third quarter was 
attributable to a decrease in net sales in Europe due to a decrease in total 
Macintosh computer unit sales, partially offset by higher average aggregate 
revenue per Macintosh computer unit.  The decrease in the third quarter was 
also attributable to a decrease in net sales in Japan due to a decrease in the 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit, partially offset by an 
increase in total Macintosh computer unit sales.  The flat net sales in the 
first nine months primarily reflects strong net sales growth in Japan and 
certain countries within Europe during the first quarter of 1996, offset by 
decreases in net sales in the second and third quarters.  International net 
sales represented 52% and 53% of total net sales for the third quarter and 
first nine months of 1996, respectively, compared with 49% and 50% for the 
corresponding periods of 1995.  Domestic net sales decreased by approximately 
21% and 13% in the third quarter and first nine months of 1996, respectively, 
when compared with the corresponding periods of 1995.

The Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis.  
Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on 
changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ("backlog") can be, and often are,
canceled at will.  The Company attempts to fill orders on the requested 
delivery schedules.  The Company's backlog increased to approximately $468 
million at August 2, 1996, from approximately $369 million at May  3, 1996.  
This increase in backlog is primarily the result of an increase in orders due 
to certain new product introductions.  The Company estimates that product 
backlog would have been approximately $430 million at August 2, 1996 if certain
quality problems with certain Powerbook products had not occurred.

In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any 
particular time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of its future 
business prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of 
or immediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering 
by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply once 
dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.  Because of 
the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog, 
backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability 
to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. 

The Company believes that net sales will remain below prior years levels 
through at least the first quarter of 1997.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and its 
cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale of products is
influenced in significant part by the price set by the Company for its products
relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based primarily on 
the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs.   Because 
the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the 
personal computer industry (including certain ASICs), its component costs may 
be higher than those incurred by other manufacturers.  The type and cost of 
components included in particular configurations of the Company's products 
(such as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to 
market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers.  
Competition in the personal computer industry is intense, and, in the short 
term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary
in order to remain competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of 
net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by actions 
undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide competitive pressures.

Gross margin decreased to 18.5% and 6.1% during the third quarter and first 
nine months of 1996, respectively, when compared with the corresponding periods
of 1995. The decrease in the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the 
corresponding quarter of 1995 is due to the Company's response to extreme 
competitive actions by other companies attempting to gain market share, which 
included pricing actions in the U.S., Japan and Europe across most product 
lines, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain product 
components. The decrease in gross margin in the first nine months of 1996 as 
compared with the first nine months of 1995 is primarily a result of a $616 
million charge in the second quarter of 1996 principally for the write-down of 
certain inventory, as well as the cost to cancel excess component orders, 
necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the 
Company's products, primarily its entry level products.  Also, the Company 
separately incurred $77 million in charges in the second and third quarters 
that reflect the estimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain 
entry level, Performa and Powerbook products, covering both goods held in 
inventory and shipped goods.  In addition, gross margins were adversely 
affected by aggressive pricing actions in Japan, particularly severe in the 
first quarter of 1996, in response to extreme competitive actions by other 
companies attempting to gain market share, and pricing actions in the U.S. and 
Europe across all product lines in order to stimulate demand.

The decrease in gross margin levels in the third quarter and first nine months 
of 1996 compared with the corresponding periods of 1995 was slightly offset by 
hedging gains less the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain 
foreign currencies.  The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into 
account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of 
operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates.  

Although the Company is taking actions to improve gross margins as it 
implements its new strategic plan, it is anticipated that gross margins will 
continue to remain under pressure due to a variety of factors, including 
continued industrywide pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed 
product life cycles, and the need to sell through current inventory at prices 
reflecting the recent write-downs.

Research and development expenditures for the third quarter of 1996 decreased 
when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 as a result of the 
termination of certain third party joint development efforts.  The increase in
the first nine months is primarily due to higher project and headcount related 
spending in the first six months of 1996 as compared to the first six months of
1995, partially offset by a decrease in certain research and development 
expenditures in the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the third quarter of 
1995 as previously discussed.  The increase as a percentage of net sales in the
third quarter of 1996 when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 was 
a result of the decrease in the level of net sales.

<PAGE>


As part of the Company's restructuring plan and new strategic direction, the 
Company expects to reduce the number of employees engaged in research and 
development activities and to streamline its product offerings.  As a result, 
the Company expects that research and development expenditures will decrease 
relative to historical levels after significant portions of the restructuring 
plan have been completed.  Nevertheless, the Company believes that continued 
investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and 
competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to continued, 
timely development of new and enhanced products.  The Company believes a 
greater portion of its research and development efforts will be conducted 
through collaborations with third parties.  In addition, where appropriate the
Company plans to acquire and license technologies from third parties.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and
remained essentially flat in the first nine months of 1996 when compared with
the corresponding periods of 1995. The decrease in the third quarter of 1996 
as compared with the same quarter of 1995 was primarily due to reduced 
advertising expenditures, while for the first nine months of 1996 as compared 
with the first nine months of 1995 the spending related to marketing and 
advertising programs was unchanged.  The increase as a percentage of net sales 
in the third quarter when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 was 
primarily a result of the reduced overall level of net sales.

As a result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that selling, 
general and administrative expenditures will decrease relative to historical 
levels.

In the first and third quarters of 1995, the Company lowered its estimates of 
the total remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan initiated in 
the third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased income by 
$17 million and $6 million, respectively.

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased in the third quarter and 
increased from expense to income in the first nine months of 1996 when compared
to the corresponding periods in 1995, primarily due to realized gains on sales 
of available-for-sale securities of $69 million in the third quarter of 1996, 
and favorable variances related to realized and unrealized foreign exchange 
hedging gains (losses) as a result of less volatility in the foreign exchange 
markets in the second quarter of 1996 as compared to the second quarter of 
1995, offset by unfavorable variances in interest income related primarily to 
lower average cash balances and lower interest earnings rates.  The Company's 
cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading from January 1996 
through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C by Moody's Investor 
Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively, and of its long-
term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's 
Rating Agency, respectively.

The Company's balance sheet at June 28, 1996, contains a total deferred tax 
asset of $401 million. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based 
on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. Realization of 
approximately $100 million of the asset is dependent upon the Company's ability
to generate approximately $285 million of future U.S. taxable income. 
Management believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will be 
realized based upon forecasted income.  However, there can be no assurance that 
the Company will meet its expectations of future income.  The Company will 
continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by 
assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent on
the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market 
technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand 
patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the Company 
must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results 
and financial condition.  Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect 
the Company's future operating results and financial condition include, without
limitation: continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the effect any 
reaction to such competitive pressures has on inventory levels and inventory 
valuations; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery to the 
marketplace of successful technological innovations; the effects of significant
adverse publicity; the Company's ability to supply product in certain 
categories; the impact of uncertainties concerning the Company's strategic 
direction and financial condition on revenue and liquidity; the effect of 
degradation in the Company's liquidity; and the effect of restructuring 
actions.

The Company expects to continue to incur operating losses throughout at least 
the remainder of 1996, if not longer.

Restructuring of Operations

In the second quarter of 1996, the Company formulated a new strategic direction
and announced certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost 
structure, improving its competitiveness and restoring profitability.  There 
are several risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost
structure.  These include the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce 
expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability and the risk that cost-
cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and remain 
competitive in the computer industry.  

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has begun to implement a new 
business model.  Implementation of the new business model involves several 
risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the Company will
increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce overall sales and 
increase its reliance on unproven products and technology.  Another risk of the 
new business model is that by increasing the proportion of the Company's 
products to be produced under outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose 
control of the quality of the products manufactured and lose the flexibility to
make timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing 
market conditions.  In addition, the new business model could adversely affect 
employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and motivate 
employees.  Also, because the new business model contemplates that the Company 
will reduce its research and development expenditures by, among other things, 
relying to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with 
third parties, the Company will have less direct control over its research and 
development efforts and its ability to create innovative new products may be 
reduced.  Finally, even if the new business model is successfully implemented, 
there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the various issues 
currently facing the Company.  In addition, although the Company believes that 
the action that it is taking under its restructuring plan should help restore 
marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can be no assurance 
that such actions will succeed.

For the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the current 
restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will not 
be required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and 
financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty 
in effectively managing the transition to the new business model and cost 
structure.

For more information regarding the Company's restructuring actions initiated 
in the second quarter of 1996, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to Liquidity and 
Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, 
which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions 

Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is 
characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological 
advances, the Company frequently introduces new products and product 
enhancements.  The success of new product introductions is dependent on a 
number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage
the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application 
software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line 
with anticipated product demand, the manufacturing of products in appropriate 
quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have 
quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.  Accordingly, the 
Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its 
sales or results of operations.  In addition, the uncertainties and risks 
associated with new product introductions may be increased as a result of the 
Company's new business model which will, in part, emphasize a refocusing of 
product offerings and the introduction of new products for key growth segments.

					14
<PAGE>


The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new 
product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for 
that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not under the 
control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large purchases by a
small segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology 
prior to its acceptance by the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases 
in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology and, 
as a result, deferred purchases of other products; and over-ordering by dealers
who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors.  The preceding may 
also be offset by other factors, such as the deferral of purchases by many 
users until new technology is accepted as "proven" and for which commonly used 
software products are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once 
they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in 
backlog. 

Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the 
aforementioned demand factors, often increasingly coincident with introduction,
and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain 
sufficient supply of products. 

The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further complicated 
by the availability of different product configurations, which may include 
various types of built-in peripherals and software.  Configurations may also 
require certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, as a 
result, demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the 
availability of third-party software in those localized versions.  For example,
the availability of European-language versions of software products 
manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions
by a quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's 
new products outside the United States, even though localized versions of the 
Company's products may be available.

The greater integration of functions and complexity of operations of the 
Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults 
could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products have 
been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant, the Company could 
incur material recall and replacement costs under product warranties.

Competition

The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by 
aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent 
introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement 
in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of 
consumers and a large number of competitors.  In the first nine months of 1996,
the Company's results of operations and financial condition were, and in the 
near future are expected to be, adversely affected by industrywide pricing 
pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The industry has also been 
characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality and 
hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry 
standards.  Some of the Company's competitors have greater financial, 
marketing, manufacturing and technological resources, broader product lines 
and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be affected
by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for 
one platform over another or one set of product features over another.

The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Macintosh 
operating system ("Mac OS").  The Mac OS has a minority market share in the 
personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers that run 
the MS-DOS(registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows(trademark) operating 
systems.  The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived advantages 
over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving force behind sales of the Company's 
personal computer hardware for the past several years.  Recent innovations in 
the Windows platform, including those introduced by Windows 95, have added 
features to the Windows platform similar to those offered by the Mac OS.  The 
Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the 
competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result 
of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.  The Company's future 
operating results and financial condition may be affected by its ability to 
increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.  The Company recently 
announced a new strategy with respect to updating its operating system.  Rather
than introduce a comprehensive new operating system in a single release, the 
Company intends to issue periodic releases consisting of discrete operating 
system components.  The Company expects that this will enable it to introduce 
some new functionality for the operating system sooner than it would be able to
introduce a complete new operating system.  As part of its efforts to increase 
the installed base for the Macintosh platform, the Company announced the 
licensing of the Mac OS to other personal computer vendors in January 1995, 
and several vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh 
operating system.  The Company believes that licensing the operating system 
will result in a broader installed base on which software vendors can develop 
and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  However, there 
can be no assurance that the installed base will be broadened by the licensing 
of the operating system or that licensing will result in an increase in the 
number of application software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring 
to market application software based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as a result
of licensing its operating system, the Company is forced to compete with other 
companies producing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits to the Company 
from licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than offset by the 
disadvantages of being required to compete with them.

As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS and Windows, 
the Company has devoted substantial resources toward developing personal 
computer products capable of running application software designed for the 
MS-DOS or Windows operating systems ("Cross-Platform Products"). These products
include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601 microprocessor and the 486 DX2/66 
microprocessor, which enable users to run concurrently applications that 
require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 operating systems.  
During the third quarter of 1996 the Company began shipment of Cross-Platform
Products that include the Pentium or 586-class chip, or in which a Pentium or 
586-class microprocessor can be installed through the use of an add-on card.

Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who purchase 
Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system software under licensing 
agreements with Microsoft.  However, in order to do so, the Company will need 
to enter into one or more agreements with certain Microsoft distributors.

On November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with International 
Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware 
reference platform for the PowerPC microprocessor that is intended to deliver 
a much wider range of operating system and application choices for computer 
customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company is moving forward with 
its efforts to make the Macintosh operating system available on the common 
platform.  In line with its efforts, on November 13, 1995, the Company, IBM, 
and Motorola, Inc. announced the availability of the "PowerPC Platform" 
specifications, which define a "unified" personal computer architecture in 
order to give access to both the Power Macintosh platform and the PC 
environment.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition 
may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this agreement and 
to manage the risk associated with the transition to this new hardware 
reference platform. 

Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed 
to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of 
third-party software for particular applications.  The Company believes that 
the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware
products depends in part on the third-party developers' perception and analysis
of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software
for the Company's products versus software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows 
market.  This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of 
the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be 
earned, and the costs of developing such software products.  To the extent the 
Company's recent financial losses have caused software developers to question 
the Company's position in the personal computer market, they could be less 
inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for 
the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources toward 
developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  
Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of application software for the
Company's products.  Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application 
software for the Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception 
of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating systems. 

					16
<PAGE>


The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also 
dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of the 
PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to continue 
to supply to the Company microprocessors that produce superior price/
performance results compared with those supplied to the Company's competitors 
by Intel Corporation, the developer and producer of the microprocessors used by
most personal computers using the MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.  IBM 
produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as well as 
workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of 
OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's 
interest in supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the Company's 
products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a competing 
manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.  

Recently, several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM and 
Microsoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain 
of the Company's key market segments, including education and publishing.  Some
of these companies have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and 
technological resources than the Company.

The Company intends to integrate Internet capabilities into its new and 
existing hardware and software platforms.  There can be no assurance that the 
Company will be able to successfully integrate Internet capabilities into its 
products.  In addition, the Internet market is rapidly evolving and is 
characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced 
or developed products addressing access to, or authoring or communication over, 
the Internet.  Some of these competitors have a significant lead over the 
Company in developing products for the Internet or have significantly greater 
financial, marketing, manufacturing and technological resources than the 
Company, or both.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also be 
affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize on its 
investments in other markets, such as the markets for personal digital 
assistant (PDA) products. 


Global Market Risks 

A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international 
operations.  As a result, the Company's operations and financial results could 
be significantly affected by international factors, such as changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in 
which the Company distributes its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens 
against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales 
decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. 
dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-
U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases 
when the U.S. dollar strengthens.  Overall, the Company is a net receiver of 
currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker 
dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major 
currencies worldwide.  Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in 
particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the 
Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). 

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on 
the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and operating 
expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based exposures.  
Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option 
contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.  Currently, hedges of firmly 
committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The Company also 
purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain other probable, 
but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable, but not firmly 
committed transactions currently do not extend beyond one year.  To reduce the 
costs associated with these ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the 
Company also regularly sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into 
certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and 
option contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions 
intended to reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange 
hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each balance 
sheet date for changes in exchange rates.

While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest rates 
of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest 
income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of 
U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the 
interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term 
investments as well as interest paid on its short-term borrowings and long-term 
debt.  To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the 
Company has entered into interest rate swap and option transactions.  Certain 
of these swaps are intended to better match the Company's floating-rate 
interest income on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with 
the fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters
into interest rate swap and option transactions in order to diversify a portion
of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest 
rates.  These instruments may extend the Company's cash investment horizon up 
to a maximum duration of three years.

To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and 
interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and 
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its 
foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap and 
option positions on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying 
foreign currency- and interest rate-related exposures, respectively, from both 
an accounting and an economic perspective.  However, given the effective 
horizons of the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance 
that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse 
financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign 
exchange or interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for 
recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any 
given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to 
the underlying economic exposures, and as such, may adversely affect the 
Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company generally does
not engage in leveraged hedging. 

The Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the costs of 
its hedging transactions, as well as the willingness of its trading partners to
enter into hedging transactions with the Company.

Inventory and Supply

In line with the Company's efforts to redesign its business model, the Company 
intends to streamline its product offerings in its key usage areas in 
education, business and the home.  This simplification of product lines has 
resulted in inventory reserves.   Cancellation fees related to custom component 
inventory purchased for anticipated product introductions that have been 
canceled have also been paid or incurred.  The Company has also separately 
provided for the estimated cost to correct certain quality problems on certain 
entry level, Performa and Powerbook products.  Although the Company believes 
its inventory and related reserves are adequate, no assurance can be given that 
the Company will not incur additional inventory charges.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory well in 
advance of product shipments.  Because the Company's markets are volatile and 
subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk that the Company
will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of 
particular products.  The Company's operating results and financial condition 
have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the 
Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term 
shifts in customer demand patterns.  

Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by 
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the 
Company or otherwise.  As a result of the Company's restructuring plan, which 
includes the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility to
SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related manufacturing outsourcing agreement 
with SCI, the proportion of the Company's products produced under outsourcing 
arrangements will increase.  While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed 
cost of operations, they may also reduce the direct control the Company has 
over production.  It is uncertain what effect such lessened control will have 
on the quality of the products manufactured or the flexibility of the Company 
to respond to changing market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the 
Company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject 
the Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement.  

Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions 
for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially 
responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service.  Accordingly, in the 
event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain 
primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, 
whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, 
could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial 
condition.
					18
<PAGE>

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited by the 
availability of key components.  The Company believes that the availability 
from suppliers to the personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs 
presents the most significant potential for constraining the Company's ability 
to produce products.  Specific microprocessors manufactured by Motorola, Inc. 
and IBM are currently available only from single sources, while some advanced 
microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and 
thus have limited availability.  The Company and other producers in the 
personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with 
other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due 
to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their 
products (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries).  Finally, the 
Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal 
computer industry (including certain ASICs).  Continued availability of these 
components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the 
production of common components instead of components customized to meet the 
Company's requirements.  Such product supply constraints and corresponding 
increased costs could decrease the Company's market share and adversely affect 
the Company's future operating results and financial condition.  


Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the 
Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of distribution is 
through third-party computer resellers.  The Company also distributes product 
through consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer electronics 
outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business and financial 
results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these 
resellers weakens or if resellers within consumer channels decide not to 
continue to distribute the Company's products.

Uncertainty over the demand for the Company's products may cause resellers to 
reduce the ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under the 
Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to reduce 
or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances without 
financial penalty.  Resellers also have the option to return products to the 
Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they may be 
assessed fees.  In the third quarter of 1996, the Company experienced a 
reduction in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty 
concerning the Company's condition. 

Other Factors

The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its 
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are located near 
major seismic faults. The Company's operating results and financial condition 
could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may 
subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, in 
some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the 
ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and 
leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the 
Company.  It is unclear what the effect of such regulation will have on the 
Company's future operating results and financial condition.

The Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing transaction 
systems (which include order management, distribution, and finance) with a 
single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational 
efficiency.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition 
could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and 
effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system.  

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the 
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance 
should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in 
future periods.  In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic 
industry often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock 
price.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and 
short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings, increased to $1,172 
million at June 28, 1996, from $491 million at September 29, 1995.  The 
Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term investments increased to $1,359 million at June 28, 1996, from $952 
million at September 29, 1995.    The Company's cash and cash equivalent 
balance includes $173 million pledged as collateral to support letters of 
credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the 
terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado manufacturing facility to
SCI Systems, Inc., and at September 29, 1995 includes $90 million pledged as 
collateral to support short-term borrowings. 

Cash generated by operations during the first nine months of 1996 totaled $112 
million.  Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in
accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in accounts
payable.  Cash generated during the first nine months of 1996 from the sale of 
certain equity investments and the sale of the Fountain manufacturing facility 
to SCI Systems, Inc. totaled $120 million.  

Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $55 
million in the first nine months of 1996, and consisted primarily of increases 
in manufacturing machinery and equipment.  The Company expects that capital 
expenditures in 1996 will remain below 1995 levels.

Short-term borrowings at June 28, 1996, were approximately $274 million lower 
than at September 29, 1995.  During the third quarter, an outstanding loan to 
Apple Computer B.V., a subsidiary of the Company, in the amount of $200 
million was repaid in full.  At June 28, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary 
of the Company, held $187 million of short-term borrowings from several banks, 
with maturity dates ranging from September 1996 to December 1996.  The majority 
of these loans are guaranteed by the Company.

The Company's balance of long-term debt increased during the first nine months 
of 1996 due to the issuance of $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% 
unsecured convertible subordinated notes to certain qualified parties in a 
private placement.  These notes were sold at 100% of par.  These notes pay 
interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001. For more information 
regarding the Company's unsecured convertible subordinated notes, refer to Note
2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item
I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is hereby 
incorporated by reference.  The remainder of long-term borrowings consists of 
$300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes issued under an 
omnibus shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in 1994.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective 
yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on 
February 15, 2004.  

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for 
the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments 
thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies for the years 1984 
through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these years have been 
resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency proposing 
increases to the amount of the Company's federal income taxes for the years 
1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a petition with the United States Tax 
Court to contest these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management believes that 
adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these
tax examinations. 

As noted on page 13 under the subheading "Interest and other income (expense), 
net",  the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading 
from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C by 
Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively, 
and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor Services and 
Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In addition, the Company may 
be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its 
borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than 
in the past.  The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash 
equivalents, together with continued short-term borrowings and the sale of 
certain assets and other investments, will be sufficient to meet its operating 
cash requirements, including the impact of planned restructuring actions, on a 
short- and long-term basis.  No assurance can be given that short-term 
borrowings can be continued, or that any additional financing that may be 
required if the restructuring plan takes longer to implement than anticipated 
or is not successful can be obtained.  If the Company is unable to obtain such 
financing, its liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be
materially adversely affected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

Reference is made to Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 29, 1996 for a discussion of 
certain purported shareholder class action suits filed in January 1996 and 
March 1996.  In August 1996, the Company's demurrer to the complaint in the 
action styled Abraham and Evelyn Kostick Trust v. Peter Crisp, et al. was 
sustained on a variety of grounds.  The court granted the plaintiffs sixty 
days to amend their complaint.  In June 1996, a purported class action 
complaint naming the Company and certain current and former officers, directors
and employees was filed in the California Superior Court for Alameda County, 
styled as LS Men's Clothing Defined Benefit Pension Plan v. Spindler, et al., 
No. CV 767971.  The complaint, which seeks damages, generally alleges that the 
defendants misrepresented or omitted material facts about the Company's 
operations and financial results which plaintiff contends artificially inflated
the Company's stock price.  None of the defendants has yet responded to the 
complaint.

The Company has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits (fewer than 100)
in each of which the complaint alleges that the plaintiff incurred so-called 
"repetitive stress injuries" to the upper extremities as a result of using 
keyboards and/or mouse input devices sold by the Company.  All of these cases 
are in various stages of pre-trial activity.  These suits are similar to those 
filed against other major suppliers of personal computers.  Ultimate resolution 
of the litigation against the Company may depend on progress in resolving this 
type of litigation in the industry overall.

In August 1995, the Company was named, along with forty-one other entities, 
including computer manufacturers and computer monitor vendors, in a putative 
nationwide class action filed in the California Superior Court for Orange 
County, styled Keith Long, et al. v. AAmazing Technologies Corp., et al.  The 
complaint alleges that each of the defendants engaged in false or misleading 
advertising with respect to the size of computer monitor screens.  Also in
August 1995, the Company was named as the sole defendant in a purported class 
action alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for 
Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. Apple Computer, Inc.  Subsequently, 
in November 1995, the Company, along with 26 other entities, was named in a 
purported class action alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior
Court for Essex County, entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple Computer, Inc., et 
al.  Similar punative class actions have been filed in other California 
counties in which the Company was not named as a defendant.  The complaints in 
all of these cases seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, 
damages, punitive damages and attorneys fees.  In December 1995, the California
Judicial Council ordered all of the California actions, including Long, 
coordinated for purposes of pre-trial proceedings and trial before a single 
judge, the Honorable William Cahill, sitting in the County of San Francisco.  
All of the California actions were subsequently coordinated under the name In 
re Computer Monitor Litigation and a master consolidated complaint filed 
superseding all of the individual complaints in those actions.  On July 3, 
1996, Judge Cahill ordered all of the California cases dismissed without leave 
to amend as to plaintiffs residing in California on the ground that a 
stipulated judgment entered in September 1995 in a prior action brought by the 
California Attorney General alleging the same cause of action was res judicata 
as to the plaintiffs in the consolidated California class action suits.  Both 
the New Jersey cases and the consolidated California cases are at a preliminary
stage, with no discovery having taken place.

The Company has various claims, lawsuits, disputes with third parties, 
investigations and pending actions involving allegations of false or misleading 
advertising, product defects, discrimination, infringement of intellectual 
property rights, and breach of contract and other matters against the Company  
and its subsidiaries incident to the operation of its business.  The liability,
if any, associated with these matters was not determinable as of the date of 
this filing. 

The Company believes the resolution of the actions cited above will not have a 
material adverse effect on its financial condition as reported in the 
accompanying financial statements.  However, depending on the amount and timing
of any unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the 
Company's future results of operations or cash flows could be materially 
affected in a particular period.

Exhibit 10.A.32


June 13, 1996


Mr. Robert M. Calderoni
19670 Scotland Road
Saratoga, California 95070


Employment Agreement


Dear Mr. Calderoni:

		The following sets forth our agreement regarding the terms anD
provisions of your employment as an officer and employee of Apple Computer, 
Inc. (the" Company"). Capitalized words which are not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to such words in Section 6 of this Agreement.

		1.  Commencement of Employment. Your employment under this 
Agreement shall commence on July 8, 1996 (the "Effective Date").

		2. Position.  You shall be employed as Senior Vice President, 
Finance and Operations Controller of the Company and shall report directly to
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and your duties and 
responsibilities to the Company shall be consistent in all respects with such
position.  You shall devote substantially all of your business time, attention,
skills and efforts exclusively to the business and affairs of the Company, 
other than de minimis  amounts of time devoted by you to the management of your
personal finances or to engaging in charitable or community services.  Your 
principal place of employment shall be the executive offices of the Company in
Cupertino, California, although you understand and agree that you will be 
required to travel from time to time for business purposes. 

		3.  Compensation.

		(a)  Base Salary.  As compensation to you for all services 
rendered to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company will pay you a base
salary at the rate of not less than two hundred seventy five thousand dollars
($275,000) per annum as of the Effective Date. Your base salary will be paid
to you in accordance with the Company's regular payroll practices applicable
to its executive employees.
					25
<PAGE>


		(b)  Bonus.  You shall be eligible to participate in the annual
Senior Executive Bonus Plan (domestic) sponsored by the Company or any successor
plan thereto.  Such bonus program shall afford you the opportunity to earn an 
annual bonus for each fiscal year of the Company during your employment.  
During the remainder of the Company's Fiscal Year 1996 only, you shall be 
guaranteed a bonus payout at the end of Q4 in the amount of thirty five 
thousand dollars ($35,000).  During the Company's Fiscal Year 1997 only, your

thereafter shall be reviewed annually by the Company.  Subject to the provision
above regarding a guaranteed bonus payout during the Company's Fiscal Year 1996
and 1997, each annual bonus shall be paid to you in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the bonus plan then in effect.

		(e)  Benefits. You shall be eligible to participate in all 
employee benefit plans and arrangements that the Company provides to its

<PAGE>


		4.  Termination.

		(a)  Termination for Cause.  If your employment is terminated
by the Company for Cause, the Company shall pay you the full amount of the 
accrued but unpaid base salary you have earned through the date of your 
termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of your base salary
then in effect) for all unused accrued vacation.  In addition, you shall be 
entitled to benefits under the employee plans and arrangements described in 
Section 3(e) above in accordance with terms and provisions of such plans and
arrangements.

	(b)  Termination Other than for Cause.  During the first twelve (12)
months following the Effective Date only, if your employment is terminated by
the Company for reasons other than for Cause, the Company shall pay you the 
full amount of the accrued but unpaid base salary you have earned through the 
date of your termination.  In addition, you shall be eligible for participation
in Apple's Executive Severance Plan ("ESP").  Under the current terms and 
conditions of the ESP, you would remain an active employee, receiving full

termination, and be eligible to receive a severance benefit equal to four (4) 
month's pay.  In addition, you will be entitled to receive the following 
amounts: 

	50% of FY 97 target bonus
	as guaranteed ($75,000)

	or

	The actual prorated bonus amount
	payable under the ESP
					
There shall be no other payments or benefits on termination during the first 
twelve (12) months following the Effective Date.

	(c)  Although the terms and conditions of the ESP would govern your 
participation, the following highlights some of the material terms and 
conditions in the event of a Change in Control, as defined in and provided for
under the June 9, 1995 Supplement to the ESP:

COVERAGE:  Employees of the Company who are otherwise Eligible Employees under
	   the Executive Severance Plan, other than those who have employment 
	   or retention agreements.



TERM:	   The Supplement is effective for two years, beginning on the Change 
	   in Control Date.  Change in Control Date generally means the date
	   of the Change in Control or the date of the approval of an agreement
	   which will result in a Change in Control.
					
					27
<PAGE>

SEVERANCE: The Supplement to the Executive Severance Plan provides for the 
	   following enhanced severance benefits:

	   -The regular severance payment schedule for such employees is 
	   doubled, with a minimum of 8 months of severance and a maximum of 
	   24 months.

	   -The regular benefit continuation period is also doubled.

	   -Employees who are terminated in the two-year period following the
	   Change in Control Date receive a special bonus equal to 1 times 
	   target bonus in lieu of the prorated bonus provided under the normal
	   plan provisions.

	   -Employees can resign for "Good Reason" and collect the foregoing 
	   amounts if their principal place of employment is relocated to a 
	   location which is more than 50 miles from their current place of 
	   employment or if their job duties are significantly changed 
	   (i.e., a drop of two grade levels or a required pay reduction).

	   Severance payments are contingent upon the signing a release in 
	   favor of the Company in substantially the form of the release 
	   contemplated under the current terms of the Executive Severance 
	   Plan.

GROSS-UP:  All payments and benefits to eligible employees are "grossed-up" to
	   eliminate the effects of the 20% excise tax under the "golden 
	   parachute" rules.  These gross-up provisions are intended to place 
	   the employees in the same after-tax position they would have enjoyed
	   had the excise tax not applied.  These provisions apply to all pay 
	   and benefits subject to the excise tax.  The provisions also apply 
	   whether or not a termination of employment has occurred because the 
	   Company's equity plans confer benefits which could trigger the 
	   excise tax provisions even if employment is not terminated.  No 
	   gross-up is payable if the payments to an eligible employee are not
	   subject to the golden parachute excise tax.

CHANGE IN 
CONTROL:   The definition includes a change in the majority of the Board of 
	   Directors not otherwise approved by the Incumbent Directors, the 
	   acquisition of 30% or more of the voting stock of Apple by a third
	   party, or a merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction if 
	   the stockholders of Apple before the transaction do not own, 
	   immediately after the transaction, more than 50% of the combined 
	   voting power of the resulting corporation.

AMENDMENT: The Executive Severance Plan cannot be amended after the Change in 
	   Control Date to eliminate or reduce benefits.  No amendment reducing
	   benefits will be effective if made within the 1-year period prior to 
	   the Change in Control Date.

Exhibit 10.A.34

Ms. Ellen Hancock

Los Gatos, CA 95030

Retention Agreement


Dear Ellen:

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"),
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take 
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of 
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and 
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in 
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of 
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps 
should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in 
control of the Company.

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company,
the Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this 
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in 
the event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words in
Section 8 of this Agreement.

		1.  Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of your
employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control Date
and shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control Date
(the "Term").

		2.  Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

		(a)  Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, 
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no 
less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the 
Change in Control Date.

		(b)  Salary and Bonus.  Your base salary and annual bonus 
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically 
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to 
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

		(c)  Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

					36
<PAGE>

		(d)  Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in all 
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company 
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate, 
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the 
Company.

		(e)  Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control 
Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel for business 
purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the amount of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date. 

		3.  Involuntary Termination During the Term.  

		(a)  Severance Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the 
date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but unpaid
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time
of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of
your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have accrued
as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within 5 days of
the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus for the year in 
which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the basis of your 
target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all performance targets
have been or will be achieved.  In addition, the Company shall pay you in a 
cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date of your execution of the 
release described in the last sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of
Termination, if later), an amount (the "Severance Payment") equal to the sum of
(i) two times your Reference Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.  
The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any other severance payments which 
you are entitled to receive under any other severance pay plan or arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance 
Payment shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor of the 
Company in substantially the form of the release required for the receipt of 
severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this 
Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period
specified therein.

		(b)  Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue 
to be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as 
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe 
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your 
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions in effect for you and
your dependents immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For 
purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the 
period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the earlier to occur
of (i) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination and (ii) the date that
you and your dependents are eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a 
subsequent employer which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits
to you and your dependents.
	
		(c)  Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination of your 
employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated by a 
notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "Notice of Termination").  
The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in 
this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts 
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your employment
under the provision so indicated.  The date of your termination of employment 
with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Date of Termination") shall be 
determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, 
thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you 
shall not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such
thirty (30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by the Company 
in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the Notice of 
Termination is received by you and (iii) if your employment is terminated by
the Company for Cause, the later of the date specified in the Notice of 
Termination or ten (10) days following the date such notice is received by 
you.  

					37
<PAGE>

If the basis for your Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good 
Reason, the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your 
Notice of Termination is received by the Company.   The Date of Termination 
for a resignation of employment other than for Good Reason shall be the date 
set forth in the applicable notice, which shall be no earlier than ten (10) 
days after the date such notice is received by the Company.		
		
		(d)  No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required to 
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise except 
as specifically provided in clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 3(b).

		4.  Additional Payment.  

		(a)  Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the 
contrary, if it is determined that any Payment would be subject to the excise 
tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with 
respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or 
penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be
entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will
place you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed 
if the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up 
Payment shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the 
formula {(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting 
Firm deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

		E	equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess
			parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G
			(b)(1) of the Code;

		M	equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes
			applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

		T	equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the 
			Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm 
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

 		(b)	Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the 
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this Section 4, 
including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the Payments 
constituting excess parachute payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting 
calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen days of the Change in 
Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other date reasonably requested 
by you or the Company on which a determination under this Section 4 is
necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay to you the initial Gross-Up 
Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you and the Company of the Accounting
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide you with
an opinion that the Accounting Firm has substantial authority under the Code 
and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your federal income tax return.  
Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you and the 
Company.


					38
<PAGE>

If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount of the 
Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be owing by you with respect to any
Payment (hereinafter an "Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its 
remedies under Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional 
Gross-Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

		(c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of 
any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require 
the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice shall be given
as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise the 
Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested
to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the 
thirty-day period following the date on which you notify the Company, or such 
shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with respect to such claim are due 
(the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in writing prior to the 
expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, you shall:
(i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company 
relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the claim as
the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, accepting
legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably 
selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with
the Company in good faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company
to participate in any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the
Company to control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, 
permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, 
proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of
such claim.  If requested by the Company, you agree either to pay the tax 
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner and
to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative 
tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate 
courts as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company
directs you to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the Company shall advance 
the amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and interest-free basis (the 
"Advance").  The Company's control of the contest related to the claim shall be
limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up Payment and you shall be entitled
to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issues raised by the 
Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If the Company does not
notify you in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to 
contest the claim, the Company shall pay to you an additional Gross-Up Payment
in respect of the excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim,
and you agree to pay the amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the 
claim to the applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

		(d)  Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an Advance, you 
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance 
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together with any
interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after 
receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be 
entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not 
promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then the 
amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you and the amount
thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up Payment then owing
to you.  

		(e)  Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify you and 
hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any costs, expenses, penalties, 
fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by you with respect to 
the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, 
including, without limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to
contest a claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 
action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  The Company shall pay 
all legal fees and expenses incurred under this Section 4, and shall promptly
reimburse you for the reasonable expenses incurred by you in connection with 
any actions taken by the Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, 
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion

		(f)  Combined Payments.   Anything in this Section 4 to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a 
required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount of all
Combined Payments has at the time such payment is due exceeded the Limit.  If 
the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in 
the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you only the
portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can be paid to you without 
causing the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments to exceed the Limit. In 
the event that you are entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and
other employees or former employees of the Company are also entitled to 
gross-up payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined
Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such payments would cause the 
Limit on Combined Payments to be exceeded, the Company shall allocate the 
amount of the reduction necessary to comply with the Limit among all such 
payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-up payment bears
to the aggregate amount of all such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) 
shall require you to repay to the Company any amount that was previously paid
to you under this Section 4.

		5.  Other Provisions.  

		(a)  Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted to you
under the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become 
exercisable in the event of your Involuntary Termination on or following the 
Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date of the
Equity Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will vest and become 
exercisable as of such date.

		(b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the 
terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the 
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that 
the Administrator elects not to cash out such Equity Awards, the Administrator
has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such Equity Awards to be
assumed or an equivalent option or stock appreciation right granted by the 
successor corporation to the Company or a parent or subsidiary of such 
successor corporation, or (ii) to provide that your Equity Awards will remain
outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning on the date that you are so 
notified of such action by the Administrator and that such Equity Awards will
expire to the extent not exercised at the end of such thirty-day period (the 
"30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator determines to utilize the 30-Day
Alternative, the Company shall pay you with respect to each such Equity Award
the excess, if any (the "Additional Amount"), of the Change in Control Price
you would have received had the Equity Award been cashed out on the date of 
the Equity Plan Change in Control over the value of the consideration actually
received by you in settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such
consideration is received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary
Termination on or after the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the date
of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you the Additional
Amount as if your employment had continued through the date of the Equity Plan 
Change in Control.  In either case, the payment of the Additional Amount shall
be made within 5 days following the determination by the Administrator of the 
Change in Control Price.

		(c)  Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time or is 
structured in such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely that you would 
be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing profits under 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability") if you were to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through a merger) of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, such transaction and (ii) your
inability to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term 
Awards on or prior to the date of such Equity Plan Change in Control eliminates
or reduces the value of some or all of your Short-Term Awards, then, on the 
date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company  shall pay you in a cash
lump sum the amount of $0.  The  provisions of  clause (ii) of the previous   

    					40
<PAGE>

sentence shall be deemed to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising,
tendering or otherwise disposing of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Transaction Date in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b) a 
Short-Term Award cannot be repurchased, exchanged or cashed-out by the Company
(or other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date without a risk of 
Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are required to delay the 
exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards in order
to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability and such delay results in your receiving
consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued at the date such consideration
is received) which is of lesser value than the consideration you would have 
received (valued as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control) for such 
awards had such delay not occurred.  The foregoing provisions shall apply to 
your Equity Awards notwithstanding your Involuntary Termination of employment
with the Company on or after the Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity
Plan Change in Control.  The provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if
(A) prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company provides you at its
expense with an opinion from a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating
that the exercise, tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards
as part of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan Change in
Control will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability and (B) following
your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you to exercise, 
tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the
Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing the value thereof.   

		(d)  General.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary not
withstanding, in no event shall the vesting and exercisability provisions 
applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be less favorable to 
you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof. 

		6.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or 
reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which
reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by you
as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your 
termination of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or 
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) 
arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of
this Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however, that the amount of
the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall not exceed $2 
million.

		7.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a)  Assumption by Successor. The Company will require any 
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no 
such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such assumption 
shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this 
Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees 
to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

		(b)  Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, 
consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of 
and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, 
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you
should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had 
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or
other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.

		8.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national

Company.  To the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting firm shall

Arrangements.

		"Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in 
the applicable Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity Plan,

Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to 
physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting
from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a written demand for 
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, which demand 
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that you have
not substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not 
substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such demand.   For
purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall
be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good 
faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the 
best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice 
to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard 
before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were
guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first 
sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		"Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6
(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act,

provided, however, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

		(i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, 
	trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any 
	syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the 
	Exchange Act, is  or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in 
	Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange 
	Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing
	30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then 
	outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election of directors
 	of the Company;

		(ii)  during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not 
	including any period prior to the execution of this Agreement) 
	individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board
	and any new directors, whose election by the Board or nomination for	
	election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at 
	least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then still in office 
	who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose 	
	election or nomination for election was previously so approved (the 
	"Incumbent Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority 
	thereof; 

					42

		(iii)  There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation

	the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;

		(iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are

series of transactions, the consummation of which would result in a Change in 
Control and (iv) the date the Company fails to satisfy its obligations to have
this agreement assumed by any successor to the Company in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change in Control Date occurs as a 
result of an agreement described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence or 
as a result of the approval of the Board described in clause (iii) of the 
previous sentence and the Change in Control to which such agreement or approval
relates (the "Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, 
then the Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date") following the
date the Board certifies by resolution duly adopted by three-fourths (3/4ths) 
of the Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in 
Control is not reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this 
sentence shall not apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment
with the Company has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on or

commence upon the occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.

Company terminates prior to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably 
demonstrated that your termination of employment (i) was at the request of the
third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in 
Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of the 
Change in Control, then Change in Control Date shall mean the date immediately
prior to the date of your termination of employment.

independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable to make such 
selection, such selection shall be made by any adult member of your immediate 
family), and approved by the Company.  The determination of such physician made
in writing to the Company and to you shall be final and conclusive for all

Exhibit 10.A.35

Mr. George M. Scalise

Los Altos Hills, California  94022


Retention Agreement


Dear George:

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), 
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take 
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of 
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty and 
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in 
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of 
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps 
should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in 
control of the Company.

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, 
the Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this 
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in 
the event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words 
in Section 8 of this Agreement.

		1.	Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of 
your employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control 
Date and shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control
Date (the "Term").

		2.	Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the 
following terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

		(a)	Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, 
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no 
less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the 
Change in Control Date.

					49
<PAGE>

		(b)	Salary and Bonus.  Your base salary and annual bonus 
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically 
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to 
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

		(c)	Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

		(d)	Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company 
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate, 
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the 
Company.

		(e)	Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control 
Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel for business 
purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the amount of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date. 

		3.	Involuntary Termination During the Term.  

		(a)	Severance Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the 
date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but unpaid 
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time
of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of 
your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have accrued 
as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within 5 days of
the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus for the year in
which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the basis of your 
target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all performance targets
have been or will be achieved.  In addition, the Company shall pay you in a 
cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date of your execution of the 
release described in the last sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of
Termination, if later), an amount (the "Severance Payment") equal to the sum 
of (i) two times your Reference Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.
The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any other severance payments which 
you are entitled to receive under any other severance pay plan or arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance 
Payment shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor of the 
Company in substantially the form of the release required for the receipt of 
severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this 
Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period 
specified therein.

					50
<PAGE>

		(b)	Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue 
to be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as 
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe 
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your 
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions in effect for you 
and your dependents immediately prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For 
purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the 
period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on the earlier to occur
of (i) the second anniversary of the Date of Termination and (ii) the date that
you and your dependents are eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a 
subsequent employer which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits
to you and your dependents.

		(c)	Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination of 
your employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated
by a notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "Notice of 
Termination").  The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific 
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in 
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for 
termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.  The date of 
your termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Date
of Termination") shall be determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is 
terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is 
given (provided that you shall not have returned to the full-time performance 
of your duties during such thirty (30) day period), (ii) if your employment is
terminated by the Company in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after 
the date the Notice of Termination is received by you and (iii) if your 
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, the later of the date 
specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10) days following the date such
notice is received by you.  If the basis for your Involuntary Termination is 
your resignation for Good Reason, the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) 
days after the date your Notice of Termination is received by the Company.   
The Date of Termination for a resignation of employment other than for Good 
Reason shall be the date set forth in the applicable notice, which shall be no
earlier than ten (10) days after the date such notice is received by the 
Company.		
		
		(d)	No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required to 
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking 
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit 
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as 
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise except 
as specifically provided in clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 3(b).

		4.	Additional Payment.  

					51
<PAGE>

		(a)	Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if it is determined that any Payment would be subject to the 
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties 
with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or
penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be
entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will
place you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed 
if the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up 
Payment shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the 
formula {(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting 
Firm deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

		E  equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess 
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code;

		M  equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes 
applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

		T  equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the 
Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm 
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

 		(b)  Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the 
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this Section 4,
including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the Payments 
constituting excess parachute payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment,
shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting
calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen days of the Change in 
Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other date reasonably requested 
by you or the Company on which a determination under this Section 4 is 
necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay to you the initial Gross-Up 
Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you and the Company of the Accounting 
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is 
payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to provide you with
an opinion that the Accounting Firm has substantial authority under the Code 
and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your federal income tax return.
Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you and the 
Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount 
of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be owing by you with respect
to any Payment (hereinafter an "Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting 
its remedies under Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional 
Gross-Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.
_______________________________________
   1  To be expressed in up to three decimal places.  For example, a combined 
federal, state and local marginal rate of 56% would be expressed as .560.

<PAGE>

		(c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of 
any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require 
the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice shall be given
as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise the 
Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim is requested
to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the thirty-
day period following the date on which you notify the Company, or such shorter
period ending on the date the Taxes with respect to such claim are due (the 
"Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in writing prior to the 
expiration of the Notice Period that it desires to contest the claim, you 
shall:  (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the 
Company relating to the claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the 
claim as the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, 
accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney 
reasonably selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to you; (iii) 
cooperate with the Company in good faith in contesting the claim; and (iv) 
permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to the claim.  
You shall permit the Company to control all proceedings related to the claim
and, at its option, permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all 
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing
authority in respect of such claim.  If requested by the Company, you agree 
either to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in 
any permissible manner and to prosecute such contest to a determination before
any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or 
more appellate courts as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that,
if the Company directs you to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the Company 
shall advance the amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and interest-
free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the contest related to 
the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up Payment and 
you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other 
issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If 
the Company does not notify you in writing prior to the end of the Notice 
Period of its desire to contest the claim, the Company shall pay to you an 
additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments that 
are the subject of the claim, and you agree to pay the amount of the Excise Tax
that is the subject of the claim to the applicable taxing authority in 
accordance with applicable law.

		(d)  Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an Advance, you 
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance 
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together with any 
interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after 
receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be 
entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not 
promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then the 
amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you and the amount
thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up Payment then owing 
to you.  

		(e)  Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify you and 
hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any costs, expenses, penalties, 
fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by you with respect to
the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, 
including, without limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to
contest a claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 

					53
<PAGE>

action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  The Company shall pay 
all legal fees and expenses incurred under this Section 4, and shall promptly 
reimburse you for the reasonable expenses incurred by you in connection with 
any actions taken by the Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, 
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses related to the opinion 
referred to in Section 4(b).		

		(f)  Combined Payments.   Anything in this Section 4 to the 
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a 
required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount of all 
Combined Payments has at the time such payment is due exceeded the Limit.  If 
the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in 
the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you only the 
portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can be paid to you without 
causing the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments to exceed the Limit. In 
the event that you are entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and 
other employees or former employees of the Company are also entitled to 
gross-up payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined
Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such payments would cause the 
Limit on Combined Payments to be exceeded, the Company shall allocate the 
amount of the reduction necessary to comply with the Limit among all such 
payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-up payment bears 
to the aggregate amount of all such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) 
shall require you to repay to the Company any amount that was previously paid 
to you under this Section 4.

		5.  Other Provisions.  

		(a)  Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted to you 
under the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become 
exercisable in the event of your Involuntary Termination on or following the
Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date of the
Equity Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will vest and become 
exercisable as of such date.

		(b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the 
terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the 
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that the
Administrator elects not to cash out such Equity Awards, the Administrator has
the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of all or substantially all 
of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such Equity Awards to be 
assumed or an equivalent option or stock appreciation right granted by the 
successor corporation to the Company or a parent or subsidiary of such 
successor corporation, or (ii) to provide that your Equity Awards will remain 
outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning on the date that you are so 
notified of such action by the Administrator and that such Equity Awards will 
expire to the extent not exercised at the end of such thirty-day period (the 
"30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator determines to utilize the 30-Day 
Alternative, the Company shall pay you with respect to each such Equity Award 
the excess, if any (the "Additional Amount"), of the Change in Control Price 
you would have received had the Equity Award been cashed out on the date of the
Equity Plan Change in Control over the value of the consideration actually

					54
<PAGE>

received by you in settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such 
consideration is received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary 
Termination on or after the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the date 
of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you the Additional 
Amount as if your employment had continued through the date of the Equity Plan 
Change in Control.  In either case, the payment of the Additional Amount shall 
be made within 5 days following the determination by the Administrator of the 
Change in Control Price.

		(c)  Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time or is 
structured in such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely that you would 
be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing profits under 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability") if you were to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through a merger) of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, such transaction and (ii) your
inability to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term 
Awards on or prior to the date of such Equity Plan Change in Control eliminates
or reduces the value of some or all of your Short-Term Awards, then, on the 
date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you in a cash
lump sum the amount of $0.00.  The provisions of clause (ii) of the previous 
sentence shall be deemed to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising,
tendering or otherwise disposing of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Transaction Date in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b) a 
Short-Term Award cannot be repurchased, exchanged or cashed-out by the Company 
(or other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date without a risk of
Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are required to delay the 
exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards in order
to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability and such delay results in your receiving 
consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued at the date such consideration
is received) which is of lesser value than the consideration you would have 
received (valued as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control) for such 
awards had such delay not occurred.  The foregoing provisions shall apply to 
your Equity Awards notwithstanding your Involuntary Termination of employment 
with the Company on or after the Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity
Plan Change in Control.  The provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if
(A) prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company provides you at its
expense with an opinion from a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating 
that the exercise, tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term Awards
as part of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan Change in
Control will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability and (B) following 
your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you to exercise, 
tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing the value thereof.   

		(d)  General.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and exercisability provisions
applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be less favorable to 
you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof. 

					55
<PAGE>

		6.  Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or 
reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including, 
without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses which 
reflect common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred by you 
as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your 
termination of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or 
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) 
arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability of 
this Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however, that the amount of 
the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall not exceed $2 
million.

		7.  Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a)  Assumption by Successor. The Company will require any 
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner 
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no 
such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such assumption 
shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this 
Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees 
to perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

		(b)  Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement shall be 
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, 
consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of 
and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, 
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you
should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had 
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or
other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.

		8.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following 
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

		"Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such firm is 
unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national 
accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement between you and the 
Company.  To the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting firm shall
be designated to perform the calculations in respect of the Combined 
Arrangements.

		"Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in 
the applicable Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity Plan, 
the Board.

					56
<PAGE>

		"Cause" shall mean a termination of your employment during the 
Term which is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii) your willful 
disclosure of material trade secrets or other material confidential information
related to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your 
willful and continued failure substantially to perform your duties with the 
Company (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to 
physical or mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting 
from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a written demand for 
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, which demand 
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that you have 
not substantially performed your duties, and which performance is not 
substantially corrected by you within 10 days of receipt of such demand.   For 
purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall 
be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good 
faith and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the 
best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be 
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice
to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard 
before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were
guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first 
sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		 "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 
6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, 
whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; 
provided, however, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 
notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

	(i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, 
trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any syndicate 
or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, is 
or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General 
Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 
securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power
of the Company's then outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election 
of directors of the Company;

	(ii)  during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including any 
period prior to the execution of this Agreement) individuals who at the 
beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new directors, whose 
election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders 
was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then
still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or 
whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved (the 
"Incumbent Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; 

					57
<PAGE>

	(iii)  There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or other 
corporate transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"), in each case, 
with respect to which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such 
Transaction do not, immediately after the Transaction, own more than 50 percent 
of the combined voting power of the Company or other corporation resulting from 
such Transaction;

	(iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold, 
liquidated or distributed; or

	(v)   there is a "change in control" of the Company within the meaning 
of Section 280G of the Code and the Regulations.

		"Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the 
date on which the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date on which the Company
executes an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence
of a Change in Control, (iii) the date the Board approves a transaction or 
series of transactions, the consummation of which would result in a Change in 
Control and (iv) the date the Company fails to satisfy its obligations to have 
this agreement assumed by any successor to the Company in accordance with 
Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change in Control Date occurs as a 
result of an agreement described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as 
a result of the approval of the Board described in clause (iii) of the previous
sentence and the Change in Control to which such agreement or approval relates
(the "Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then the 
Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date") following the date the
Board certifies by resolution duly adopted by three-fourths (3/4ths) of the 
Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in Control is 
not reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this sentence shall not
apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment with the Company has 
occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on or prior to the Reset 
Date or (B) the Contemplated Change in Control subsequently occurs within three
months of the Reset Date.  Following the Reset Date, the provisions of this 
Agreement shall remain in effect and a new Term shall commence upon the 
occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first 
sentence of this section, if your employment with the Company terminates prior 
to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably demonstrated that your 
termination of employment (i) was at the request of the third party who has 
taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change in Control or (ii) 
otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control,
then Change in Control Date shall mean the date immediately prior to the date 
of your termination of employment.

		"Change in Control Price" shall mean the "Change in Control 
Price" as defined in the applicable Equity Plan and determined by the 
Administrator as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, whether or
not the Administrator is required under the terms of the applicable Equity Plan
to determine such price as of such date.

		"Combined Arrangements" shall mean this Agreement, the 
Retention Agreements entered into as of the date first set forth above between 
the Company and certain of its executive officers, any Retention Agreement 
entered into after the date hereof which is specifically designated by the 
terms thereof as one of the Combined Arrangements and the Supplement to the 
Severance Plan.

					58
<PAGE>

		"Combined Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash amount of (i) 
severance payments made to you under Section 3(a) of this Agreement or to any 
other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement, (ii) severance payments made under Sections 
2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-Up Payments made to you under 
Section 6 of this Agreement or to any other employee or former employee under

Exhibit 10.A.36
			AIRPLANE USE AGREEMENT
			    # C98-96-00012

This Airplane Use Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the 27th day of
June, 1996, by and between Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation, 
having its principal place of business at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA  95014
("Apple"), Gilbert F. Amelio, 13416 Middle Fork Lane, Los Altos Hills, CA  
94022 ("Amelio"), and Aero Ventures, 13416 Middle Fork Lane, Los Altos Hills, 
CA  94022 ("Aero Ventures").
	
			     INTRODUCTION

Amelio owns and Aero Ventures manages an airplane (N55OAV) which will be used 
for Apple business-related travel.

			       AGREEMENT
1.	Ownership

Amelio represents and warrants that he is the sole owner of the aircraft 
described in Exhibit A ("the Airplane").  Amelio must inform Apple immediately 
upon any change in his ownership status of the Airplane.

2.	Apple's Rights and Responsibilities

2.1	Authorized Business Use.  Apple shall use the Airplane for travel on 
Apple business when such use is appropriate and is specified on a Travel 
Authorization Form approved prior to the commencement of travel in accordance
with Apple's applicable Corporate and Finance policies ("Authorized Business 
Use").

2.2	Apple's Lease of the Airplane.  Apple shall lease the Airplane from 
Amelio for Authorized Business Use at the Apple Lease Rate, as described below.
Such leased use shall include travel for Authorized Business Uses.  Apple will 
pay the pilot and/or co-pilot directly for piloting fees.

2.3	Costs Paid By Apple.  In addition to the payments described in Section 
2.2 above, Apple will reimburse Amelio for (1) costs actually incurred by 
Amelio to maintain currency and proficiency as a pilot, such as flight medical 
expenses and simulator training; and (2) the costs of food, beverages, other 
personal items, parking fees, landing fees, and fuel incurred during Authorized
Business Use by Apple.
					65
<PAGE>

2.4	Apple Lease Rate.  Apple will pay to Amelio an hourly rate for lease 
of the Airplane based on actual flying time as recorded on the Airplane's log 
book.  This Apple Lease Rate is determined to be the fair market value of such 
leased use, and as such will be subject to annual review and if necessary, 
adjustment.  The initial Apple Lease Rate shall be $700.00 per hour for all 
usage.  If Amelio upgrades to a more capable airplane, there will be no 
adjustment without prior Apple approval.

2.5	Apple Advance.  Apple will pay to Amelio a non-refundable, monthly 
advance on lease payments in the amount of  $6,000.  This monthly advance 
amount shall be applied against lease payments payable by Apple to Amelio for 
Authorized Business Use of the Airplane.  Apple may carry forward any unused 
monthly advance payments as credits toward lease payments due in subsequent 
months.  However, such carried-forward monthly advance payments shall not 
affect Apple's obligation to pay the full, monthly advance on lease payments.

2.6	Apple's Insurance.  Amelio will maintain $20 million of liability 
insurance.  Apple shall be responsible for any liability insurance coverage 
in excess of $20 million.

2.7	No Other Obligations.  The payments and reimbursements specified in 
this section shall constitute the extent of Apple's obligation to pay Amelio 
for the costs of maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and any and all other 
expenses related to maintaining the Airplane in flightworthy condition.

3.	Amelio's Responsibilities

3.1	Amelio's Use Of The Airplane.  Amelio's use of the Airplane in 
connection with his performance of services for Apple shall be limited to 
Authorized Business Use.

3.2	Amelio's Costs.  Amelio shall be responsible for payment of all costs
not specifically charged to Apple in this Agreement.

3.3	Amelio's Pilot Training And License.  Amelio is responsible for 
arranging for and undertaking instruction and flying time to maintain currency
and proficiency as a pilot of the Airplane.  Amelio must notify Apple of any 
change or lapse in his pilot license status.

3.4	Amelio's Operation Of The Airplane.  When operating the Airplane on 
Apple Business Use, Amelio will maintain and operate the Airplane at all times 
in compliance with all Federal, state or local laws and regulations applicable
to the operation of the Airplane or private aircraft in general.  In addition, 
Amelio agrees to comply with any and all restrictions and limitations imposed 
by Apple's insurance policies related to Amelio's use of the Airplane.

					66
<PAGE>

3.5	Passengers.  Amelio understands and agrees that as a general policy, 
he will not carry as passengers on Authorized Business Use any persons who are 
not Apple employees, officers or directors.  To the extent there are legitimate 
business purposes for exceptions, Amelio will carry such non-Apple passengers 
only if they have each executed and filed with Apple a release, in form and 
substance approved in writing by Apple, releasing Apple from any and all 
liability arising out of such passenger accompanying Amelio on the Airplane in 
connection with an Authorized Business Use.

3.6	Indemnity And Insurance.

	(a)  Indemnity.  Amelio hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless 
	Apple, its directors, officers, employees and other agents 
	(collectively, "the Indemnitees") against and from any and all 
	liabilities, claims, demands, losses, costs and expenses of any kind
	or nature whatsoever which may be asserted against or suffered or 
	incurred by the Indemnitees or any of them arising out of or in 
	connection with Amelio's ownership, operation or use of the Airplane 	
	whether for Authorized Business Use or any other purpose and whether 
	in accordance with or in breach of this Agreement.  The foregoing 
	indemnity is specifically intended to apply whether or not any such 
	liability, claim, demand, loss, cost or expense may to any extent have 
	arisen out of or been based upon the negligence or claimed negligence 
	of Amelio or any of the Indemnitees.

	(b)  Insurance.  Amelio will carry Comprehensive General Liability 
	insurance from USAIG, AAU, CIGNA or another insurer suitable to Apple 
	with limits not less than $20,000,000 combined single limit per 
	occurrence and with a worldwide coverage territory.  Before operating 
	the Airplane on any Authorized Business Use, Amelio will deliver to 
	Apple a Certificate of Insurance which shows the coverage specified 
	above, which names Apple as an additional insured, and which provides 
	a 30-day notice period for cancellation or reduction in coverage or 
	limits.

4.	Term and Termination

4.1	Term.  This Agreement will become effective upon execution by Apple, 
and after approval by the Board of Directors of Apple.  The Agreement is

party will be released from all obligations and liabilities to the other 
occurring or arising after the date of such termination, except that the 
provisions of Sections 3.6(a), 4.3 and 6, and any liability arising from 
breach of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement.  Neither 
party will be liable to the other for damages of any sort solely as a result 
of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, except as 
specifically provided above.  Termination of this Agreement will be without 
prejudice to any other right or remedy of either party.

5.	Upgrade

	It is Amelio's intention to upgrade the Airplane to a more capable 
airplane within the next 12 months.  Upon such upgrade, the lease rate will 
not be adjusted to reflect the fair market value for the new aircraft without
prior Apple approval.

6.	General

6.1	Applicable Law.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of California as 
applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within 
California between California residents.

of, and waive any venue objections against, the United States District Court 
for the Northern District of  California, the Superior Court of the State of 
California for the County of Santa Clara, the Santa Clara Municipal Court, and
any mutually agreed to alternative dispute resolution proceeding taking place 
in Santa Clara County, California, in any litigation arising out of the 
Agreement.

finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable,
that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent 
permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of 
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

	In consideration of the mutual agreements set forth below, Michael 
H. Spindler ("Spindler") and Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") agree to the 
following terms and conditions of this Separation Agreement (the 
"Agreement"):

	1.	Nature of Business.  Apple is in the business of designing, 
developing, producing, selling and marketing computer systems, related 
products and services.  The business practices of Apple and the market 
conditions in which Apple operates change rapidly and these changes 
have necessitated prompt changes in management, and/or managers' 
responsibilities.  These changes are needed from time to time in the high 
level management positions such as those for which Spindler has been 
employed.

	2.	Resignation from Board, Termination of Employment and 
Rescission of Retention Agreement.  Spindler has resigned from his 
position on Apple's Board of Directors effective as of February 2, 1996 and 
has been terminated from his position as Chief Executive Officer effective 
as of February 2, 1996.  Spindler also hereby resigns from all other 
positions he holds on behalf of Apple, its subsidiaries and affiliates (except 
for his position as an employee), which positions are set forth at Exhibit A 
hereto.  Spindler agrees to sign at Apple's request all appropriate 
mutually agreeable documentation prepared by Apple to facilitate these 
resignations and termination.

	Spindler and Apple agree that in exchange for the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, the June 9, 1995 Retention Agreement 
between Spindler and Apple, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 
B, is hereby rescinded and that neither party has any further rights or 
obligations under the Retention Agreement.

	3. 	 Employment Status/Termination.  During the period 
February 2, 1996 through March 31, 1996 ("Termination Date"), Spindler 
will remain an employee of Apple as provided in this paragraph reporting 
to Gilbert F. Amelio ("Amelio") and shall be available to assist Amelio as 
may be mutually agreed to between Spindler and Amelio.   Spindler shall

					72
<PAGE>

 be on sabbatical from February 15, 1996 through Termination Date.  Until 
Termination Date, Spindler will continue to receive his regular salary and
 full executive level medical insurance benefits.  Termination shall be 
accomplished by the return of Spindler's Apple Identification Badge to 
Edward B. Stead.  Beyond the return of Spindler's Apple Identification 
Badge, Spindler represents that all other Apple property has been 
returned to Apple and there are no further actions required to be taken by 
Spindler prior to Termination Date.  To the extent this Agreement varies 
from the terms and conditions of any Apple employee benefit plan, 
program or policy, or any other agreement, written or oral, this 
Agreement shall govern. 

	4.	Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination.  Within 
five (5) days of Termination Date, Apple will pay the following:

		a.	Severance Payments.   Spindler shall receive the full 
amount of his accrued but unpaid base salary earned through Termination 
Date plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of Spindler's base salary 
then in effect) for all accrued but unused vacation as of Termination Date.  
In addition, Apple shall also pay Spindler a lump sum payment of three 
million, seven hundred twelve thousand, five hundred dollars 
($3,712,500).  Apple shall continue to pay for and provide Spindler with 
health insurance benefits in accordance with terms and provisions of such 
plans and arrangements in effect on the Termination Date for a period of 
two (2) years from Termination Date.

Apple's Board of Directors (the "Board") previously granted Spindler 
options to purchase shares of Apple Common Stock under Apple's 1981 
and 1990 Stock Option Plans (the "1981 and 1990 Plans") and options to 
purchase shares of stock under Apple's 1987 Executive Long Term Stock 
Option Plan ("ELTSOP").  Except as expressly provided below, nothing in 
this Agreement shall alter the terms and conditions of such options and 
such options shall continue to vest and be exercisable in accordance with 
the terms of the grant agreement issued to  Spindler with respect to such 
grants, and the terms of the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans and the 
ELTSOP administered by the Board. As of Termination Date, (a) all stock 
option grants previously awarded to Spindler under the ELTSOP shall 
continue to vest for a period of one (1) year from Termination Date and 
shall be exercisable for a period of two (2) years from Termination Date 
provided, however, that all such options shall be subject to the 10-year 
expiration provisions of the ELTSOP, and (b) all stock option grants 
previously awarded to Spindler under the 1981 and 1990 Plans shall 
continue to vest during, and be exercisable for, a period of ninety (90) days 
from Termination Date.
					73
<PAGE>

The payment outlined in this Paragraph 4(a) shall constitute full 
satisfaction of all Apple's obligations to pay severance benefits to Spindler 
under Apple's Executive Severance Plan, as amended by the June 9, 1995 
Supplement, Apple's Senior/Executive Incentive Bonus, and any and all 
other written or oral agreements between Spindler and Apple including 
but not limited to, the employment agreement dated April 12, 1991, a copy 
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C.  Except as provided for in 
Paragraph 3 above and in Paragraph 4(b) below, there shall be no other 
payments to Spindler except as stated in this Paragraph 4(a).

		b.	Relocation and House Repurchase.  Apple shall pay 
Spindler, in full satisfaction of any and all obligations to pay moving 
expenses for Spindler and his family under any Apple policy, plan or 
program a lump sum payment in the amount of fifty thousand dollars 
($50,000).  In addition, Apple shall pay Spindler one hundred fifty 
thousand dollars ($150,000) in full satisfaction of any and all obligations 
Apple may have had to purchase Spindler's Atherton, California house 
under any Apple plan, program, policy, or agreement, both oral and in 
writing.

		c	Receipt of Documentation.  Spindler acknowledges 
that he has previously received from Apple copies of pertinent portions of 
Apple's Executive Severance Plan, as amended by the June 9, 1995 
Supplement, Apple's Senior/Executive Bonus Program, Apple's 1981 and 
1990 Stock Option Plans, Apple's ELTSOP, Apple's Vacation and Holiday 
Policies, and Apple's Benefit Plans relating to health care, life insurance, 
accidental death and disability, short and long term disability and Savings 
Plans. Spindler understands and agrees to be bound by the written terms 
and conditions of these various plans, policies or programs, unless 
expressly provided for otherwise under this Agreement or in the Plan, and 
agrees that Apple has reserved the right and option, in its sole discretion, 
to change, interpret, modify or terminate these and all other plans, policies 
or programs at any time without Spindler's consent so long as such action 
does not conflict with or reduce Spindler's rights under this Agreement.

		d.	No Other Benefits.  Spindler will not be entitled to 
receive any other compensation, bonus or benefits provided by, through 
or on behalf of Apple, its affiliates or subsidiaries, other than benefits that 
are vested as of Termination Date and that are payable in accordance with 
the terms of any applicable Benefit Plan, or otherwise provided for herein.

					74
<PAGE>

	5.	Confidentiality.  The terms of this Agreement are 
confidential.  Neither Spindler nor Apple will at any time disclose to any 
third party the terms of this Agreement, except as authorized by this
agreement or as required by law.  Spindler may also make such disclosure 
to his spouse, tax advisor and/or lawyer, all of whom shall be instructed 
to keep the information disclosed to them confidential; any disclosure by 
any such party shall be deemed a disclosure by Spindler. Apple and 
Spindler shall not disparage each other in their communications in 
response to all inquiries from the press, public media or any other third 
parties regarding this Agreement or Spindler's employment termination.  
If Apple makes a press statement which disparages Spindler, then 
Spindler may invoke the procedures outlined in Paragraph 21 of this 
Agreement.  If Spindler makes a press statement which disparages Apple, 
then Apple may invoke the procedures outlined in Paragraph 21 of this 
Agreement.

	6.	Trade Secrets, Proprietary and Confidential Information.  
Spindler agrees to comply with Apple's "Proprietary Rights and 
Information Agreement" which is attached hereto as Exhibit D to this 
Agreement.

	In addition, Spindler agrees to continue to abide by the principles 
and guidelines in Apple's Global Ethics brochure, the terms of which are 
incorporated herein to the extent it applies to employee through 
Termination Date and to former employees thereafter.

	On or before Termination Date, Spindler agrees to promptly return 
to Apple or its records retention designee, all Apple proprietary and 
confidential information, including but not limited to all inventions, 
discoveries, improvements, computer programs, designs, documentation, 
notes, plans, drawings and copies thereof to Apple.  Spindler shall be 
entitled to keep as his own personal property the equipment listed at 
Exhibit E together with manuals and product data information associated 
with such equipment. 

	Spindler and Apple agree that this section regarding Trade Secrets, 
Proprietary and Confidential Information shall survive the termination of 
this Agreement.

	7.	Non-Solicitation.  Spindler further recognizes that Apple's 
work force constitutes an important and vital aspect of its business.  

					75
<PAGE>

Spindler agrees, therefore, that he shall not solicit others employed by 
Apple, or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, to become employed by any 
firm, company or other business enterprise through March 31, 1997.  
Spindler further represents that he has no time prior to this Agreement 
solicited any employee to leave Apple. Nothing in this Agreement will 
prevent Spindler from providing favorable recommendations or favorable 
references on behalf of persons  who previously worked with Spindler.
		
	Spindler and Apple also agree, that upon a breach or violation or 
threatened breach or violation of any confidentiality, trade secrets, or non-
solicitation agreement by Spindler contained herein, or if any provision of 
Sections 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement, Apple, in addition to all other 
remedies which might be available to it including rescission of the 
Agreement and repayment of the consideration paid to Spindler for the 
covenants or promises breached, shall be entitled as a matter of right to 
equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, including the right 
to obtain injunctive relief or specific performance.  Spindler and Apple 
agree that the remedies at law for any such breach or violation are not 
fully adequate and that the injuries to Apple as a result of the continuation 
of any breach or violation are incapable of full calculation in monetary 
terms and therefore constitute irreparable harm.  This Paragraph 7 shall 
survive the termination of this Agreement.

	8.	Indemnification.  All rights of indemnification previously 
provided by Apple to Spindler by Apple's By-Laws and/or by the 
Indemnification Agreement dated January 27, 1988 shall continue in full 
force and effect in accordance with their terms, following the date of this 
Agreement.  A copy of Spindler's Indemnification Agreement is attached 
hereto as Exhibit F to this Agreement.

	9.	Successors.  Apple will require any successor (whether 
direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all 
or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Apple to expressly 
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the manner and to the 
same extent that Apple would be required to perform it if no such 
succession had taken place.  Failure of Apple to obtain such assumption 
and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall 
entitle Spindler to the benefits listed in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this 
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions therein.

	10.	Governing Law.  The validity, interpretation, effect, and 
enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State 
of California without regard to its choice of law principles.

					76
<PAGE>

	11.	Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, and Exhibits A, B, C, D, 
E & F to this Agreement, set forth the entire Agreement and 
understanding between Spindler and Apple, and supersede any other 
negotiations, written agreements, understandings, oral agreements, 
representations or past or future practices, whether written or oral, by 
Apple, including but not limited to, the employment agreement between 
Apple and Spindler dated April 12, 1991, the July 26, 1995 letter 
employment agreement, and the June 9, 1995 Retention Agreement.  This 
Agreement may be amended only by written agreement, signed by the 
parties to be bound by the amendment.  Parol evidence will be 
inadmissible to show agreement by and between the parties to any term or 
condition contrary to or in addition to the terms and conditions contained 
in this Agreement.

	Each Apple plan or policy referred to herein directly or by 
implication (except the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans and the 
ELTSOP) is incorporated herein only insofar as it does not contradict this 
Agreement.  If any inconsistencies exist between this Agreement and any 
such plan or policy, this Agreement shall control.  If any inconsistencies 
exist between this Agreement and the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans or 
the ELTSOP, with the exception of the terms and conditions of Paragraph 
4 above, those stock plans shall control.

	12.	Right to Advice of Counsel.  Spindler understands that he 
has the right to have this Agreement reviewed by his lawyer and 
acknowledges that Apple has encouraged him to consult with his lawyer 
so that he is fully aware of his rights and obligations under this 
Agreement.  Spindler acknowledges that he has done so.  

	13.	Modification.  This Agreement may not be amended, 
modified, changed or discharged in any respect except as agreed in 
writing and signed by Spindler and the Chief Executive Officer of Apple 
Computer, Inc.

	14.	Severability and Interpretation.  In the event that any 
provision or any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or 
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or 
portion thereof shall be considered separate and apart from the remainder 
of this Agreement and the other provisions shall remain fully valid and 
enforceable, provided that, if Paragraph 2, 5, 6, 7, 19 or 21 is held to be 
invalid or unenforceable in response to a motion, argument or other act by 
Spindler, then Apple, at its sole discretion, may rescind the Agreement 
and recover all consideration paid to Spindler under the Agreement.

	16.	Miscellaneous.  The rights and obligations of Apple under 
this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the 
present and future subsidiaries of Apple, any and all subsidiaries of a 
subsidiary, all affiliated corporations, and successors and assigns of 
Apple.  No assignment of this Agreement by Apple will relieve Apple of 
its obligations.  Spindler shall not assign any of his rights and/or 
obligations under this Agreement and any such attempted assignment 
will be void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the 
benefit of Spindler's heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal 
representatives and their legal assigns.

	17.	Damage Limitation.  At Termination Date, Spindler shall 
not be entitled to recover any compensation, benefits or damages except as 
specifically described in this Agreement.  This damage waiver provides 
that no damages (including without limitation, special, consequential, 
general, liquidated or punitive damages or attorneys fees or costs) shall be 
sought or due from Apple.

	18.	Waiver.  A waiver by either party of any of the terms or 
conditions of this Agreement in any instance shall not be deemed or 
construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any 
subsequent breach thereof.  All remedies, rights, undertakings, 
obligations, and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be 
cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy, 
right, undertaking, obligation or agreement of either party.

					78
<PAGE>

	19.	Release.  Spindler hereby completely releases and forever 
discharges Apple, its Board of Directors, officers, directors, agents, 
employees, attorneys, insurers, subsidiaries and affiliates ("Apple 
Parties") from, and covenants not to sue any Apple Party with respect to, 
all claims, rights, demands, actions, obligations, debts, sums of money, 
damages (including but not limited to general, special, punitive, 
liquidated and compensatory damages) and causes of action of every 
kind, nature and character, known and unknown, in law or equity, 
connected with Spindler's employment relationship with the Apple 
Parties, or any other act or omission of any Apple Party which may have 
occurred prior to the date this Agreement is signed.  Spindler further 
agrees that by his acceptance and negotiation of the payment provided for 
in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement, he thereby completely releases and 
forever discharges the Apple Parties from, and covenants not to sue any 
Apple Party with respect to, all claims, rights, demands, actions, 
obligations, debts, sums of money, damages (including but not limited to 
general, special, punitive, liquidated and compensatory damages) and 
causes of action of every kind, nature and character, known and 
unknown, in law or equity, connected with Spindler's employment 
relationship with the Apple Parties, or the termination of such 
relationship, or any other act or omission of any Apple Party which may 
have occurred prior to Termination Date. This release and discharge 
includes, but is not limited to, all "wrongful discharge" claims; all claims 
relating to any contracts of employment, express or implied; any covenant 
of good faith and fair dealing, express or implied; any tort of any nature: 
any federal, state, or municipal statute or ordinance; any claims under the 
California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, and any other laws and regulations 
relating to employment discrimination and any and all claims for 
attorney's fees and costs.  Spindler specifically acknowledges that the 
foregoing release includes a complete release and discharge of all Apple 
Parties from any and all claims, damages of any kind, and claims for 
attorneys fees and costs, under the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967 ("ADEA") as amended by the Older Worker Benefit Protection 
Act ("OWBPA").  Spindler and Apple agree that part of the consideration 
payable to Spindler under this Agreement is consideration that Spindler 
would not otherwise be entitled to and is in consideration for Spindler's 
release of claims under the ADEA as amended by the OWBPA.

					79
<PAGE>

	Spindler acknowledges that he understands the protections 
provided by the OWBPA and that the provisions of the OWBPA have 
been met by the terms of this Agreement.  Spindler states that he 
knowingly and voluntarily enters into this Agreement.  Spindler 
acknowledges that this Agreement is written in a manner calculated to be 
understood by him. Spindler further acknowledges that this Agreement 
refers without limitation to rights under the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act.  Spindler understands that by this Agreement, he does 
not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the Agreement is 
executed.  Spindler acknowledges that he is entering this Agreement in 
exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which he 
already is entitled due to his employment with Apple.  Further, Spindler 
acknowledges that this release of claims under the OWBPA is not 
requested in connection with an exit incentive program or other 
employment termination program offered to a group or class of 
employees within the meaning of OWBPA.  Notwithstanding this 
provision, Spindler acknowledges that he has been allowed up to forty 
five (45) days from the date that he received this Agreement to accept its 
terms.  Spindler acknowledges he has consulted with an attorney about 
the Agreement.  Spindler acknowledges that after he signs the Agreement, 
he will then be given seven (7) days following the date on which he signs 
the Agreement to revoke it and that this Agreement will only become 
effective after this seven (7) day period has lapsed.  Any such revocation 
must be in writing signed by Spindler and immediately delivered to 
Apple's General Counsel.

	Spindler has read and expressly waives Section 1542 of the 
California Civil Code, which provides as follows:

	A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR
DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING
THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS 
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

	This waiver is not a mere recital, but is a known waiver of rights 
and benefits.  This is a bargained-for provision of this Agreement and is 
further consideration for the covenants and conditions contained herein.

	The Apple Parties hereby release and forever discharge Spindler, 
his agents and attorneys from, and covenant not to sue Spindler, his 

					80
<PAGE>

agents and attorneys with respect to, all claims, rights, demands, actions, 
obligations, debts, sums of money, damages, and causes of action 
("claims") arising from his employment relationship with Apple to the 
extent permitted by law and public policy, except for any claims arising 
from any intentional acts of misconduct, or any other act taken in bad faith 
or without a reasonable belief that it was in the best interests of the Apple 
Parties. 

	20.	Cooperation.  Spindler agrees that he will make himself 
available at reasonable times and intervals to participate in the conduct of 
and preparation for any pending or future litigation to which Apple is a 
party and in which his experience or knowledge may be relevant.  
Spindler shall be reimbursed for his reasonable travel and out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by virtue of his cooperation as described in this 
Paragraph.  In no respect shall this provision be deemed to pertain to or 
affect the nature or substance of Spindler testimony at deposition or trial 
or in any other truthful testimony at deposition or trial or in any other 
circumstances.

	21.	Remedies in Event of Future Dispute.
		
		a.	Except as provided in sub Paragraph (b) below, in the 
event of any future dispute, controversy or claim between the parties 
arising from or relating to this Agreement, its breach, any matter 
addressed by this Agreement, and/or Spindler's employment with Apple 
through Termination Date, the parties will first attempt to resolve the 
dispute through confidential mediation to be conducted in San Francisco 
by a member of the firm of Gregoria, Haldeman & Piazza, Mediated 
Negotiations, 625 Market Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, California 94105.  
If the parties' dispute is not resolved through mediation, it will be 
resolved through binding confidential arbitration to be conducted by the  
American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, pursuant to its 
California Employment Dispute Resolution Rules, and judgment upon the 
award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court having 
jurisdiction of the matter.  The prevailing party in such arbitration shall be 
entitled to recover from the losing party, not only the amount of any 
judgment awarded in its favor, but also any and all costs and expenses, 
incurred in arbitrating the dispute or in preparing for such arbitration.

		b.	In the event that a dispute arises concerning 
compliance with this Agreement, either party will be entitled to obtain 

					81
<PAGE>

from a court with jurisdiction over the parties preliminary and permanent 
injunctive relief to enjoin or restrict the other party from such breach or to 
enjoin or restrict a third party from inducing any such breach, and other 
appropriate relief, including money damages.  In seeking any such relief, 
however, the moving party will retain the right to have any remaining 
portion of the controversy resolved by binding confidential arbitration in 
accordance with sub paragraph (a) above.

	By signing the below, the parties agree to the terms hereof, 
including the Exhibits hereto, and agree that this document, and Exhibits 
A, B, C, D, E & F hereto, set forth their entire agreement, except as 
otherwise expressly provided herein.

 	as the parties agree (the "Closing Date").

					89
<PAGE>


2.2	Initial Term.  This Agreement will commence on the Closing Date and 
	remain in effect until July 1, 1999 (the "Initial Term"), unless 
	earlier terminated pursuant to Section 18 (Termination) or renewed 
	pursuant to Section 2.3 (Renewal Terms), below.

2.3	Renewal Terms.  This Agreement will renew automatically for successive 
	one (1) year renewal terms (the "Renewal Terms") unless one party 
	provides the other written notice of its intent not to renew the 
	Agreement at least ninety (90) days before the end of the Initial Term 
	or any Renewal Term thereafter.  The provisions of Section 3 
	(Percentage Volume Commitments) will not apply in any Renewal Term.

	systems, that are manufactured for sale in the Americas during such 
	year ("Percentage Volume Commitment"):

			Year 1		   Year 2		Year 3
		   (7/1/96-6/30/97)   (7/1/97-6/30/98)	   (7/1/98-6/30/99)
	

	Main Logic
	Boards 		  60%		     50%		  40%
	
	Computer
	Systems		   40%		     40%		  30%


3.2	Conditions.  Apple's Percentage Volume Commitment is conditioned upon 
	and subject to:	
	
	(i)	SCI offering and delivering Products with comparable quality, 
		and with competitive pricing, Lead Time and flexibility terms, 
		when compared with other suppliers located in the United States 
		who provide a comparable range of contract manufacturing and 
		engineering services similar to those SCI provides in 
		connection with Products;  

	(ii)	SCI allocating adequate capacity at Fountain or with Apple's 
		prior written approval, at other SCI Systems, Inc. facilities 
		to deliver such volumes to Apple; and

	(iii)	SCI's performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

					90
<PAGE>


	To the extent SCI fails to do so, Apple may, without prejudice to any 
	other rights or remedies available to it, apply volumes manufactured 
	elsewhere, by Apple or any third party, to its satisfaction of the 
	Percentage Volume Commitment.  

3.3	Volumes Manufactured at Another SCI Facility.  Apple will have the 
	option to move volumes above SCI's Base Factory Load (as defined in 
	Exhibit B, Schedules 1 and 2) to any other SCI facility to achieve more
 	competitive pricing, better service, better quality or for any other 
	reason.  All such volumes will be credited against Apple's Percentage 
	Volume Commitment.

3.4	Failure to Meet Percentage Volume Commitment.  If Apple does not meet 
	its Percentage Volume Commitment in Year 1, Year 2 or Year 3 of the 
	Initial Term for any reason other than SCI's breach of this Agreement, 
	failure to allocate adequate capacity to Apple, or failure to offer 
	competitive product on competitive terms and conditions, as required 
	above, Apple may remedy its obligations under this Agreement in one of
	two ways;  either by:

	(i) 	adding the shortfall (the number of units Apple was committed 
		to purchase less the number it actually purchased from SCI 
		during that year) to Apple's commitment for the following year 
		(except a shortfall in year 3); or

	(ii)	paying SCI the profit that SCI would have enjoyed had Apple 
		purchased the shortfall.  The profit will be calculated by 
		multiplying:
		
		-	the shortfall (the number of units Apple was committed 
			to purchase less the number it actually purchased from 
			SCI during that year); 

		-	the average unit cost (excluding profit) of product in 
			the category in which there was a shortfall (i.e. 
			boards or systems); and 

		-	the percentage profit that would have applied to the 
			shortfall per the Pricing Formula set forth in Exhibit 
			A. 
	
	Apple's failure to do so within three (3) months after the end of the 
	year in which the shortfall occurred will constitute a breach of the 
	Agreement.

4.	PRODUCT PLANS

4.1	Generally.  Apple and SCI will establish a Product Plan, in the format

	requirements set forth in the Product Plan and the Supplier Quality 
	Requirements set forth in Exhibit C.  SCI will provide Apple regular 
	reports and analysis of its yields, DPM and PPM.  SCI will also provide
	Apple, for Apple's review and approval, its corrective action 
	procedures, defect containment plan, recall risks, repair capabilities 
	and costs, business risk insurance, and known liabilities.

9.2	Incoming Inspection.  Apple may inspect Product Delivered under this 
	Agreement for deficiencies in workmanship or material either at the 
	Delivery Point and/or at its destination.  Apple may return defective 
	or non-conforming Products to SCI at SCI's cost (using SCI's selected 
	carrier) within thirty (30) days after Delivery in accordance with the 
	agreed RMA procedure set forth in the Product Plan.  

9.3	Ship to Stock/Ship to Distribution.  This Agreement and the Pricing 
	Schedules are based on the assumption that SCI can produce the Products	
	at quality levels suitable for shipment directly to Apple's 
	distribution system.  SCI's inability to achieve certification status 
	as defined in Exhibit E, will create a significant increase in costs to 
	Apple.  SCI will develop a plan to meet such requirements and 
	understands that failure to achieve certification status within a 
	reasonable time frame may result in disqualification as an approved 
	Apple supplier.

9.4	On-Site Inspections.  SCI acknowledges that it is essential for Apple 
	to have periodic access to SCI's premises for the purpose of conducting
	inspections and/or audits under this Agreement, including, without 
	limitation, audits of SCI's compliance with the Quality Requirements 
	and with export and environmental laws.  Upon reasonable notice, SCI 
	will allow Apple, during SCI's normal business hours, to visit its 
	facility to discuss and inspect its manufacturing processes, test the 
	Products, review SCI's records, etc.  Such inspections/audits and any 
	testing done by Apple during them, will not relieve SCI of liability 
	for Products later found to be defective or for SCI's failure to meet 
	its obligations under this Agreement.

9.5	Agency Approvals.  Unless the parties agree otherwise in the Product 
	Plan, Apple will be responsible for obtaining agency and regulatory 
	approvals; provided, however, that SCI will provide Apple all 
	information and assistance reasonably requested by Apple for the 
	purpose of obtaining such approvals.  If recertification is required 
	due to changes to a Product requested by SCI, SCI may be required 
	obtain and bear the cost of such recertification.

10.	PRICING

10.1	The Pricing Formula.  The unit price of each Product manufactured at 
	Fountain will be determined using the pricing formula set forth in 
	Exhibit B.  SCI will provide Apple a price quote for each new Product 
	proposed by Apple as set forth in Section 4.2, above.  The unit price 
	agreed upon by the parties will be set forth in the Pricing Schedule 
	for such Product; provided, however, that such prices may vary in 
	accordance with Section 10.2, below.   

10.2	Labor Rates and Other Cost Adders.  The Labor Rate and Other Cost Adder
	components of the pricing formula are variable depending on the actual 
	load at Fountain in each quarter of the Term, as follows:

					98
<PAGE>


	The Labor Rate (for the Initial Products and any new Products) will be 
	determined as set forth in Schedule 1 to Exhibit B based on the total 
	number of "Applicable Labor Hours" during the quarter. "Applicable 
	Labor Hours" is defined in Schedule 1 to Exhibit B.  

	The Other Cost Adders (for the Initial Products and any new Products) 
	will be determined as set forth in Schedule 2 to Exhibit B depending on
	the total number of "Applicable Units" manufactured by SCI during the 
	quarter.  "Applicable Units" is defined in Schedule 2 to Exhibit B.

	For purposes of pricing in Years 2 and 3 of the Initial Term of this 
	Agreement, SCI will be responsible for a portion of the factory load if
 	Apple's load falls below a hypothetical "Base Factory Load" defined in 
	Schedules 1 and 2 to Exhibit B. This Base Factory Load is for pricing 
	purposes only and does not represent a purchase commitment of any kind.  

	Both the Labor Rates and Other Cost Adders for a given calendar quarter 
	will be determined prospectively based on Apple's forecasts for upcoming 
	quarter.  At the end of the quarter, the Labor Rate and Other Cost Adders
	will be adjusted retrospectively to reflect the actual number of units 
	manufactured by SCI and Standard Labor Hours expended by SCI during that 
	quarter.  Within ten (10) business days after the end of each calendar 
	quarter, SCI will:

	(a)	provide Apple written verification of the actual volumes 
		manufactured by SCI during the quarter, including: the number 
		of units manufactured for Apple under the Agreement; the number	
		of units manufactured at Fountain for Mac OS Licensees; the 
		Apple Standard Hours (as defined in Schedule 1 to Exhibit B); 
		and the Third Party Standard Hours (as defined in Schedule 1 to 
		Exhibit B); and

	(b)	identify to Apple any overpayment or any underpayment resulting 
		from a difference between Apple's forecasts and actual volumes 
		during the quarter which shall be paid to either party, as 
		appropriate, within thirty (30) days.

10.3	Standard Labor Hours.  When determining the number of hours required to 
	assemble and test each new Product, SCI will use a methodology 
	consistent with that used in quoting the Initial Product prices.  This 
	methodology is set forth in Exhibit B.  

10.4	Procured Material Cost.  The Procured Material Cost for Initial 
	Products will be based on the cost of materials purchased from Apple 
	(Initial Inventory or Additional Apple Inventory) on a dollar for 
	dollar basis.  Thereafter, SCI will adjust the Procured Material Cost 
	to the lowest prices available from its vendors according to the 
	following schedule:

					99
<PAGE>


	For Category A items:  immediately (will be credited retroactively at 
			       end of month)
	For Category B items:  monthly
	For Category C items:  quarterly
	
	Where:
	
	Category A =	hard drives, CD-ROM drives, RAM, flat panel displays, 
			MPUs and other strategic components added to Category 
			A by agreement of the parties;
	Category B =	system sub-assemblies and ASICs;
	Category C =	all other components and materials.
	
	Upon repricing, a net adjustment will be made, by invoice to the 
	appropriate party, to revalue on-hand inventory.  Where, despite SCI's 
	efforts, a supplier refuses to revalue on-order inventory effective 
	immediately, the net adjustment will include those on-order units as well.
	
	Upon request, SCI will provide Apple the actual cost of specified 
	materials used in its Products.  With advance notice to SCI, Apple may 
	renegotiate the price of any component or material, and/or delivery or 
	other terms, with suppliers at any time.  SCI will pass through to 
	Apple, according to the above schedule, any cost reductions, including 
	any rebates, discounts or other value received by SCI in connection 
	with any component purchased for use in Apple's products or by 
	leveraging Apple's volumes.  Failure to do so will constitute a 
	material breach and grounds for immediate termination, except for de 
	minimus or accidental errors which are promptly remedied with interest 
	(not to exceed 1% per month on all amounts not remedied within 15 
	days).

10.5	Tooling and NRE Costs.  SCI will quote tooling, NRE, and other one time 
	costs separately, and will not incur any such cost without Apple's 
	prior written approval.  Apple will pay only those tooling costs and 
	NRE actually incurred by SCI, without markup, and will have the option 
	to amortize its payments over a reasonable period of time or number of 
	units to be agreed by the parties.  SCI will substantiate all such 
	costs, which will not exceed the initial agreed estimate unless due to 
	changes requested by Apple.

10.6	Product Cost Reviews.

	(a)	Apple and SCI will agree upon cost reduction goals with stair 
		step costs reductions to be implemented over an agreed upon 
		period of time.  These goals will be set forth in the Product 
		Plan.
	
	(b)	SCI will meet with Apple every three (3) months during the Term	 
		to review the existing Product cost and establish a plan to 
		pursue all reasonable cost reduction opportunities.  

10.7	Most Favored Customer Pricing.  SCI hereby warrants that at no time 
	will the prices charged Apple for any Product under this Agreement 
	exceed the prices offered other customers on similar terms and 	
	conditions.

					100
<PAGE>


10.8	Taxes.  The prices set forth in the Price Schedules are exclusive of 
	state or local sales, use, excise or similar taxes, which, if 
	applicable, will be paid by Apple.  

10.9	Reports.  SCI will provide Apple monthly reports within ten (10) 
	business days after the end of each month, and quarterly reports within
	ten (10) business days after the end of each of calendar quarter 
	showing:  (i) the number of Standard Labor Hours actually expended at 
	Fountain for third parties during such month or quarter; and (ii) the 
	number of Mac OS Systems and boards for Mac OS Systems manufactured at 
	Fountain for third parties during such month or quarter.  

10.10	Royalties.  Unless stated otherwise in a Product Plan, SCI will have no
 	obligation to collect and pay separate royalties to any third party 
	(except those royalties contained within a vendor's product price).

11.	FORECASTS, ORDERS & ADJUSTMENTS

11.1	Forecasts.  Apple will provide SCI, every calendar month during the 	
	Term, a forecast covering the period of six (6) calendar months 
	beginning with the month in which such forecast is provided.  Such 	
	forecast will specify the number of units of the Products which Apple 
	anticipates purchasing during such six (6) month period.  Such 
	forecasts will be non-binding and will not be regarded as a commitment	
	to purchase by either party. 

11.2	Purchase Orders.  Apple will order Products by issuing monthly Purchase
 	Orders to SCI on a rolling four month basis, in writing or by 
	electronic means, in accordance with the applicable Lead Time(s).  To 
	be effective, all Purchase Orders must reference this Agreement and 
	contain the following terms, summary of initial P.O. attached as 
	Exhibit _________.

	(a)	description of the Products to be purchased, including Apple's 
		part number; 

	(b)	quantity to be purchased; 
	
	(c)	delivery instructions, including routing, delivery schedule and 
		destination; and
	
	(d)	confirmation of price.
	
	SCI will accept Apple Purchase Orders within five (5) working days 
	after it receives them.  Failure to deliver an acknowledgment to Apple 
	within such five (5) day period will be deemed acceptance.  Only terms 
	(a) - (d), above, and the terms of this Agreement will apply to orders 
	for Products, even if Apple's Purchase Order and/or SCI's 
	acknowledgment form contains other terms and conditions.  In the case 
	of conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, the terms of
	this Agreement will prevail.  Any remedies at law or equity not 
	specifically disclaimed or modified by this Agreement remain available 
	to both parties.

					101

11.3	Authorized Purchasing Locations.  SCI agrees to accept and act upon 
	only those Purchase Orders received from the following authorized 
	purchasing locations:
	
	Apple Computer, Inc.		Apple Computer Limited
	One Infinite Loop		Holly Hill Industrial Estate
	Cupertino, CA 95014		Cork City, Ireland

	Campbell, CA  95008
	
	The above list of authorized purchasing locations may revised by Apple 
	from time to time by written notice to SCI.

11.4	Order Adjustments.
	Apple may increase, decrease or reschedule the number of units under a 
	particular purchase order as follows: 
	
	For PCBA Orders:
		Adjustments Made	Permissible Adjustment*
		Within 30 Days* 	up to 25%
		31 to 45 Days 		up to 50%
		46 to 60 Days 		up to 75%
		60+ Days 		up to 100%+

					102
<PAGE>

	For FATP Orders:
		Adjustments Made	Permissible Adjustment**
		Within 7 Days*:		negotiated
		8 to 14 Days 		up to 25% 
		15 to 21 Days 		up to 50% 
		22+ Days 		up to 100%+

	*	"Days" means the number of calendar days between Apple's order 
		adjustment and the scheduled Delivery date.

	** 	"Adjustment" means the percentage of units ordered for Delivery 
		on such Delivery Date that Apple may add to the order, delete 
		from the order or reschedule for later delivery.  
	
	Contingent on availability of materials and labor, SCI will supply 
	increased units on the originally scheduled Delivery date.  
	
	If Apple reschedules the Delivery date under a particular Purchase 
	Order more than sixty (60) days after the original Delivery date, Apple
	will pay SCI an inventory carrying charge equal to 1% of the actual 
	cost of affected inventory held by SCI on the last day of each month 
	thereafter, provided that SCI will use every effort to mitigate such 
	carrying charges to Apple by, without limitation, canceling or delaying 
	orders, returning components and utilizing components in other products 
	currently produced by SCI at any of its sites.
	
	Apple will be responsible for:

	(i)	any overtime charges required to meet Apple's needs where Apple 
		requires greater flexibility than is permitted above; and

	(ii)	any vendor premiums required to meet Apple's flexibility needs, 
		provided that such premiums are incurred due to circumstances 
		beyond SCI's control; provided that SCI will use every effort 
		to minimize such charges or premiums and will advise Apple of 
		any such charges or premiums in advance so that Apple may 
		choose whether to incur the additional cost in order to achieve 
		the desired flexibility.

11.5	Configuration Changes.  Subject to availability of materials, Apple may 
	change the configuration of quantities under a particular Purchase Order 
	at any time without penalty; provided that SCI may adjust the cost of 
	such quantities pursuant to the terms of Section 10, above. 
					
					103
<PAGE>


11.6	Cancellation of Purchase Orders. Apple may cancel any Purchase 
	Order(s), in whole or in part, on thirty (30) days notice to SCI, 
	provided that Apple will reimburse SCI for costs actually and 
	reasonably incurred by SCI, including the actual cost of materials and
	components for the ordered quantity and material adders therefore (as 
	set forth in Exhibit B "Other Cost Adders"), as the result of such 
	cancellation, but not profit or opportunity cost.  Both parties will 
	undertake reasonable measures to mitigate the costs of termination.

11.7	Lead Time Reduction Program.  SCI and Apple will meet periodically to 
	discuss options to effect reductions in Lead Times to allow improved 
	flexibility in ordering and delivery.  The agenda for each meeting will
	include identification of such options, schedules for determination of 
	associated cost and schedules for implementation. 


12.	DELIVERY, TITLE, CARRIER & RISK OF LOSS

12.1	Delivery.  SCI will Deliver the total number of units ordered in a 
	particular Purchase Order to the Delivery Point on or before the date 
	specified in such Purchase Order, subject to the provisions of Section 
	11.4 above.   

12.2	Carrier; Risk of Loss.  SCI will use Apple's Preferred Carrier(s) for 
	Delivery, provided that if Apple does not designate a preferred 
	carrier, SCI may select a common carrier at its discretion.  All 
	shipments will be FOB point of shipment, with title and risk of loss or 
	damage passing to Apple upon Delivery to the Delivery Point.

12.3	Failure to Meet Delivery Date.    

	In addition, and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies 
	available to Apple under law or otherwise:

	(a)	If a Delivery is or will be late by one or more days, provided 
		late delivery was not caused by Apple, SCI will pay the 
		incremental cost associated with air freighting the order to 
		Apple. 

	(b)	If SCI fails to Deliver all or part of any order within five 
		(5) days after the Delivery date specified in the Purchase 
		Order, Apple may, without prejudice to any other rights or 
		remedies available to Apple under law or otherwise, terminate 
		the late portion of the Purchase Order without cancellation 
		charges.  The canceled units will be credited against Apple's 
		Percentage Volume Commitment.  With respect to the portion of 
		a Purchase Order not terminated, if any, the unit price will 
		not change and SCI will otherwise continue performance under 
		this Agreement.

	(c)	If SCI fails to deliver all or part of an order within thirty 
		(30) days after the Delivery date specified in the Purchase 
		Order, Apple may, without prejudice to any other rights or 
		remedies available to Apple under law or otherwise, terminate	

						104
<PAGE>

	 	the Purchase Order without cancellation charges and purchase 
		substitute products from another source; provided that, prior 
		to such cancellation, Apple will provide SCI the opportunity to
	 	manufacture and deliver the Product within thirty (30) days 
		from any other SCI facility or to subcontract the effort to 
		another source approved by Apple for delivery within such 
		thirty (30) day period.  SCI will reimburse Apple for the 
		difference between the price of the products and the price paid
		by Apple for substituted products.  Any such substitute 
		products will be credited against Apple's Percentage Volume 
		Commitments.  With respect to the portion of a Purchase Order 
		not terminated, if any, the unit price will not change and SCI 
		will otherwise continue performance under this Agreement.   

13.	PAYMENTS

Apple will pay SCI for quantities of Product Delivered to Apple net thirty (30) 
days from the date of SCI's invoice, provided that the date of the invoice will 
be no earlier than the Delivery date for such quantities.  Apple's payment of 
SCI's invoice will not constitute final acceptance of the Product and is 
subject to adjustments for errors, shortages and defects.  Unless otherwise 
agreed by the parties, payment will be made by telegraphic transfer to a bank 
account designated by SCI.  Neither party will have the right of offset of set 
off.  At its option, five (5) working days after written notice to Apple, SCI 
may impose a late payment fee of up to one percent (1%) per month on all 
amounts past due by more than fifteen (15) days.  Both parties agree to work 
diligently to resolve any discrepancies involving invoices.

14.	SERVICE UNITS, SPARE PARTS & SERVICE DOCUMENTATION

14.1	Purchase of Spare Parts and Service Units.  Apple or its designee may 
	purchase Service Units and Spare Parts during the period beginning at 
	the Product's initial production and ending seven (7) years after SCI's	
	last shipment of such Product to Apple (even if after expiration of the 
	Agreement).  Such purchases will be governed by the applicable terms 
	and conditions of this Agreement.  Lead Times for Service Units and 
	Spare Parts during production will be no greater than the then 
	prevailing Lead Time for the Product.  In an emergency, SCI will, 
	contingent on availability of labor and components,  Deliver Service 
	Units and Spare Parts for Products in production within three (3) days; 
	provided that SCI will advise Apple of any cost, schedule or other 
	impact of such short lead time in advance of Delivery and will not 
	Deliver such Service Units or Spare Parts unless Apple approves such 
	impact in writing.  Apple acknowledges that after production, Lead 
	Times for such Service Units and Spare Parts may increase, though they 
	will at all times during such period be reasonable given the 
	availability of materials and labor.  

14.2	Allocation of Components.  If SCI does not have sufficient inventory of
	Procured Materials to satisfy Apple's Purchase Orders for Service Units
	and Spare Parts and open Purchase Order for Products, Apple may divert 
	components allocated for production of Products and Service Units to 
	Spare Parts production.   The extent such diversion of components 
	causes additional actual labor cost to SCI and/or scheduled delivery 
	delays, such impacts will be equitably negotiated between the parties. 

					105
<PAGE>


14.3	Tear-Down of Completed Product.  If after a reasonable attempt to re-
	allocate components pursuant to Section 14.2 above, Apple is required 
	to tear down completed Product or Service Units to obtain Spare Parts 
	to repair units in the field, SCI will accept return of the incomplete 
	Products or Service Units, freight collect, to SCI's designated repair 
	facilities, promptly repair the units and return the units to Apple 
	freight prepaid.  Apple will be obligated to pay SCI the reasonable 
	costs incurred by SCI in making the repairs, including SCI's freight 
	cost and profit as set forth in Exhibit B.

14.4	Packaging.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Service Units will 
	be packaged with electronic static discharge protection and will be 
	individually packaged in accordance with Apple's Packaging 
	Specification (P/N 062-0087) attached as a part of Exhibit A.  Unless 
	otherwise agreed by the parties, all other Spare Parts will be packaged 
	in bulk form with Apple's Spare Part description, part number, and 
	quantity identification on the outside of a bulk container approved by 
	Apple.  SCI will provide one packing slip for each shipment of Service 
	Units and Spare Parts on Purchase Orders submitted by Apple.  This 
	packing slip will be located on the outside of each shipping box and 
	will list:  (a) Apple's and SCI's part number and the quantity for each 
	Service Unit and Spare Part shipped; and (b) the Purchase Order number.  
	The Purchase Order number should also appear on the shipping label for 
	each separate carton shipped, and all packages of individual Service 
	Units and Spare Parts in a carton should be clearly indicated and 
	marked with Apple's part number.

14.5	Service Documentation and Tools.  SCI will provide Apple reasonably 
	complete and accurate Service Documentation as specified in the Product
	Plan to assist Apple or an approved third party in the preparation of 
	materials for servicing, repairing and inspecting the Products.  SCI 
	will also provide Apple any Service Software or other tools or fixtures 
	specified by the parties in the Product Plan, provided that Apple may 
	be required to pay for materials and components used in such tools or 
	fixtures at prices set forth in such in such Product Plan. 

15.	WARRANTIES

15.1	Pass Through Warranties:  SCI will purchase and pass through to Apple 
	material and workmanship warranties on Procured Materials specified by 
	Apple in the Product Plan, including without limitation product 
	liability warranties, so that Apple may, at its option, take warranty 
	claims directly to the vendors of such Procured Materials, rather than 
	make such claims through SCI.  If such action by Apple will impact SCI's 
	cost or delivery schedule, such cost or schedule will be equitably 
	adjusted.   SCI will also establish a process permitting Apple to 
	purchase components and materials and procure out-of-warranty repairs 
	directly from such vendors.  Such vendors will keep SCI apprised of 
	Apple's returns and business requirements.  Apple's direct relationship 
	with any such vendor will not release SCI from any of its obligations 
	under this Agreement.  

					106
<PAGE>


15.2	Epidemic Failure Warranty.  If a Product demonstrates an Epidemic 
	Failure within three (3) years of the date of manufacture, SCI will 	
	promptly repair the affected Product or Service Unit, replace it with 
	a functionally equivalent product or service unit, or credit Apple an 
	amount equal to the purchase price.  SCI will also (i) pay freight in 
	and out; and (ii) reimburse Apple for reasonable direct costs 
	associated with the Epidemic Failure, including without limitation 
	labor costs associated with diagnostics, removal of Service Units and 
	repair or replacement by Apple or Apple's service provider.
	
	The Formula for determining when an Epidemic Failure  is set forth in 
	the Product Plan for each Product attached to Exhibit A.

	Apple will notify SCI whenever an Epidemic Failure is identified or 
	suspected and work with SCI to develop a recovery plan, which may 
	include a preventative action plan if appropriate under the 
	circumstances.  The recovery plan actually implemented by Apple is in 
	Apple's sole discretion; provided, however that (i) Apple and SCI will 
	work together to minimize costs associated with Apple's recovery plan 
	as much as possible without compromising Apple's ability to 
	aggressively respond to its customer's needs; and (ii) SCI will 
	reimburse Apple only for reasonable direct costs incurred by Apple in 
	implementing that portion of the recovery plan associated with the 
	Epidemic Failure.   SCI shall not be responsible for Epidemic Failures 
	caused by Apple's specifications, instructions, drawings, or designs. 

15.3	Optional Product Warranty.

	In addition to the Epidemic Failure warranty provided under Section 
	15.1, above, Apple will have the option to purchase a fifteen (15) 
	month warranty of materials and workmanship (a "Product Warranty") for
 	any or all Products under this Agreement at a price not to exceed one-
	half of one percent (.5%) of the unit price of the warranted Product.  
	Apple may exercise its option to purchase a Product Warranty for a 
	particular Product by giving notice to SCI at any time before such 
	Product is shipped to Apple.  The agreed price of the Product Warranty 
	will be set forth in the Product Plan for such Product.  

	SCI represents and warrants to Apple that each Product for which Apple 
	purchases a Product Warranty (a "Warranted Product") will be free from 
	defects in workmanship and materials for fifteen (15) months from the 
	date SCI shipped such Product to Apple.  The Product Warranty will not 
	apply to any Warranted Product that has been abused, damaged, altered 
	or misused by someone other than SCI or that is defective as a result 
	of causes external to the Product and not caused by SCI or caused by 
	Apple supplied materials.  A Warranted Product will be considered to 
	be free from defects in workmanship if it was manufactured in 
	accordance with SCI's manufacturing workmanship standards and conforms 
	to the Specifications and Quality Requirements for such Warranted 
	Product.  

15.4 	Repair Under Product Warranty.  If SCI breaches the Product Warranty, 
	Apple may return the defective subassembly/field replaceable unit to 
	SCI for prompt repair or for replacement with a functionally equivalent

					107
<PAGE>

	 subassembly or field replacement unit, at SCI's option.  SCI will 
	issue a return authorization to Apple within two (2) days after receipt
 	of Apple's warranty claim.  Apple will return such Product, freight 
	prepaid, to the factory or service center designated by SCI in its 
	return authorization.  SCI will promptly repair or replace such units 
	at SCI's expense and deliver the repaired or replaced units to Apple 
	FOB destination, freight prepaid by SCI.  Repaired or replaced Product 
	will carry the same Product Warranty for the balance of the original 
	warranty period.  If SCI is unable to repair or replace a unit within 
	forty five (45) days of receipt, SCI will refund to Apple the purchase 
	price for that unit unless Apple has approved a repair or replacement 
	after such forty five (45) day period.  SCI may sell any units repaired 
	after such forty five (45) day period to Apple to fulfill Apple's 
	P.O.'s for Service Units or Spare Parts.

15.5	Tracking Product and Epidemic Failure Warranties.  SCI will (i) develop
	and maintain a system for tracking the date each unit of each Product 
	was manufactured and shipped to Apple so that the parties may identify 
	Product covered by the Product Warranty and the Epidemic Failure 
	Warranty; and (ii) make such information available to Apple upon 
	Apple's request.  SCI's tracking system will be subject to Apple's 
	approval and will be maintained at least one-hundred and twenty (120)
	days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.

15.6	Regulatory Compliance.  SCI will comply with all applicable laws and 
	regulations in performing its services under this Agreement.

15.7	Notice of Non Compliance.  If SCI discovers or suspects that any Apple 
	Product fails to comply with any applicable consumer product or 
	electrical safety rule or contains a defect that could create a 
	substantial product or electrical hazard, SCI will notify Apple 
	immediately and supply Apple with information concerning the nature and 
	extent of the defect involved and the nature and severity of injuries 
	or potential injuries related to the particular Product.  SCI will 
	notify Apple immediately of any claim made or proceeding commenced a
	gainst it arising out of its activities under this Agreement. 

15.8	Limitation of Warranty.  
	
	(a)	All claims for breach of Product Warranty or Epidemic Failure 
		Warranty must be received by SCI no later than thirty (30) 
		days after the expiration of the warranty period;

	(b)	THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES GIVEN 
		BY SCI.  SCI MAKES, AND APPLE RECEIVES, NO OTHER WARRANTY 
		EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
		OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE ARE EXPRESSLY 
		DISCLAIMED AND EXCLUDED.

	(c)	UNLESS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO BY SCI IN WRITING, SCI MAKES NO 
		WARRANTY THAT A PRODUCT WILL (I) MEET ANY SPECIFICATION NOT 
		MAKE KNOWN TO SCI, OR (II) RECEIVE THE APPROVAL OF OR BE 

					108
<PAGE>

		CERTIFIED BY UNDERWRITERS LABORATORY, ANY FEDERAL, STATE, 
		LOCAL OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AGENCY (INCLUDING WITHOUT 
		LIMITATION THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION) OR ANY 
		OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY.  COMPANY ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY 
		FOR OBTAINING SUCH APPROVALS OR CERTIFICATIONS, OR FOR 
		MEETING ANY SPECIFICATIONS BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN APPLE'S 
		SPECIFICATIONS.

15.9	No Waiver.  Apple's approval or acceptance of any Products which do not 
	meet the Specifications will not relieve SCI of its warranty 
	obligations under this Section 15.

15.10	Apple warrants the accuracy and completeness of the drawings, 
	specifications and documentation provided to SCI for the manufacture of
	components and products.

16.	INDEMNIFICATION

16.1	Indemnity by SCI.  SCI will, at SCI's expense, indemnify, hold harmless 
	and, at Apple's request, defend Apple any of its subsidiaries, 
	affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and independent 
	contractors, from and against any and all loss, cost, liability or 
	expense (including costs and reasonable fees of attorneys and other 
	professionals) arising out of or in connection with a third party claim
	that: (i) a Product caused injury or damage to a person or property; or
 	(ii) that a Product, material or component provided or procured by SCI, 
	or SCI's manufacturing process infringes any patent, copyright, trade 
	mark right, trade secret, mask work right or other proprietary right of
 	any third party; provided, however, that SCI will have no liability 
	under this Section 16.1 to the extent such infringement is attributable
	to the incorporation of designs or materials provided by Apple into the 
	Product.

16.2	Indemnity by Apple.  Apple will, at Apple's expense, indemnify, hold 
	harmless and, at SCI's request, defend SCI any of its subsidiaries, 
	affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and independent 
	contractors, from and against any and all loss, cost, liability or 
	expense (including costs and reasonable fees of attorneys and other 
	professionals) arising out of or in connection with a third party claim	
	that a Product infringes any patent, copyright, trade mark right, trade 
	secret, mask work right or other proprietary right of any third party 
	to the extent that such claim is attributable to SCI's incorporation 
	of designs or materials provided by Apple into the Product.  

16.3	Legal Compliance.  Each party will defend, indemnify, and hold the 
	other party harmless from any loss, cost, or expense directly 
	resulting from the first party's violation of any law, rule, regulation
 	or ordinance of the United States, any state, or any other governmental 
	agency in the performance of this Agreement.  

16.4	Conditions.  A party's obligation to indemnify the other under this 
	Section 16 is conditioned upon and subject to:  (a) the indemnified 
	party giving the indemnifying party reasonably prompt notice in writing
	of any such suit and permits the indemnifying party through counsel of 
	its choice, to answer the charge of infringement and defend such claim 
	or suit; (b) the indemnified party provides the indemnifying party

					109
<PAGE>

	information, assistance and authority, at the indemnifying party's 
	expense, to enable such party to defend the suit; and (c) the 
	indemnifying party will not be responsible for any settlement made 
	by indemnified party without its prior written consent.  The 
	indemnifying party agrees not to disclose or publicize the terms of
	any settlement of a suit against the indemnified party without first 
	obtaining the such party's written permission.

17.	CONFIDENTIALITY

	Each party will protect the other's Confidential Information from 
	unauthorized dissemination and use with the same degree of care that
	each such party uses to protect its own like information, but at a 
	minimum, with a reasonable degree of care.  Neither party will use the 
	other's Confidential Information for purposes other than those 
	necessary to perform this Agreement and only employees of the receiving
 	party who have a need to know such Confidential Information will have 
	access thereto.  Neither party will disclose to third parties the 
	other's Confidential Information without the prior written consent of 
	the other party.

18.	TERMINATION

18.1	Termination for Cause.  
	
	(a)	Either party may terminate this Agreement effective immediately 
		upon written notice to the other (i) for a material breach by 
		such other party not cured within thirty (30) days after written 
		notice of such breach; or (ii) if the other party admits in 
		writing its insolvency or inability to pay its debts or perform 
		its obligations as they mature or makes an assignment for the 
		benefit of creditors, or a receiver or similar officer is 
		appointed to take charge of all or a portion of the parties 
		assets.  
	(b)	Apple may terminate this Agreement effective immediately upon 
		written notice to SCI if SCI materially breaches its obligation 
		of confidentiality under Section 17.

18.2	Termination Without Cause.  After the Initial Term, but not during such 
	Term, either party may terminate this Agreement without cause by giving 
	the other ninety (90) days advance written notice.

18.3	Effect of Termination For Cause.  Upon termination of this Agreement:
	
	(i)	SCI will, to the extent and at times specified by Apple, stop 
		all work on outstanding Purchase Orders, incur no further 
		direct costs, and protect all property in which Apple has or 
		may acquire an interest.  Apple will have the option to request 
		that SCI complete work in progress pursuant to any Purchase 
		Orders open on the date of termination;

	(ii)	Apple will compensate SCI for all Product delivered and accepted 
		by Apple; and

					110
<PAGE>


	(iii)	SCI will deliver to Apple and Apple will purchase from SCI, at 
		SCI's Standard Cost, any usable Unique Components in SCI's 
		inventory of the date of termination that were purchased to 
		fulfill firm Purchase Orders or pursuant to a Letter of 
		Authorization from Apple.
	
	(iv)	Each party will return to the other, freight collect, all 
		materials that contain the other's Confidential Information, 
		or if the other party gives written instructions to do so, 
		destroy all such materials and provide the other a written 
		certificate of destruction within thirty (30) days after such 
		destruction; 
	
	Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the obligations of 
	the parties under Sections 1, 3.4, will remain in effect.

18.4	Inventory Indemnification.

	18.4.1	Upon expiration of this Agreement or termination of this 
		Agreement for cause by SCI or for convenience by Apple after 
		the Initial Term, Apple will be responsible for:

		(i)	all work-in-process at receipt of the notice of 
			termination or intent not to renew; and 

		(ii)	all procured materials purchased to fill a Purchase 
			Order or authorized by Apple in a letter of 
			Authorization to be purchased by Customer which are on
 			hand or on order at receipt of the notice of 
			termination or intent not to renew.  Items (i) and (ii)
			are referred to as the "Termination Inventory".

	18.4.2	SCI will make every reasonable effort to use the Termination 
		Inventory on other current customer programs, will cancel all 
		outstanding material orders with vendors, and will attempt to 
		return piece parts to vendors with Apple's prior approval.  
		Apple will be responsible for costs, charges and fees actually 
		incurred by SCI to cancel or return any portion of the 
		Termination Inventory to vendors and, upon mutual agreement, 
		the cost to modify the procured material for other programs.

	18.4.3	With thirty (30) days from termination or cancellation, SCI 
		will invoice, and Apple will purchase, the Termination 
		Inventory remaining after vendor cancellations and returns and 
		after other program use, as follows:  (i) for Procured Material
	 	Inventory and authorized long lead time components, at SCI's 
		standard cost, plus a reasonable handling charge; (ii) for WIP,
		at a reasonable pro rata percentage of the finished Product 
		purchase price; and (iii) for finished Product, at the purchase 
		price in effect at termination or cancellation.  With Apple's 
		prior approval, Apple will be responsible for any substantiated
		negative price differential between the price SCI paid for the 
		Procured Material and authorized long lead time components and 
		the price at which SCI was able to return and/or utilize the 
		items on other programs.  SCI will credit Customer for any 
		positive price differentials.

19.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT PURSUANT TO SECTION 16 (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER 
PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, 
EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, 
TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
PROFITS AND OPPORTUNITY DAMAGE TO ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT, COST OF 
CAPITAL, FACILITIES, SERVICE, OR REPLACEMENT POWER, DOWNTIME COSTS, OR 
CLAIMS OF EITHER PARTY'S CUSTOMERS FOR SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT

20.	PROPERTY FURNISHED BY APPLE

Apple will retain title to and beneficial ownership of any tools, dies, molds, 
jigs, patterns, hobs, computer equipment, electrodes, punches, artwork, 
screens, tapes, templates, machinery, test equipment, fixtures, gauges, Apple 
Proprietary Technology, Specifications, drawings or other documents or data 
furnished, paid for or charged to Apple.  While in SCI's possession, SCI will 
hold such property in trust for Apple and maintain and preserve such property 
for Apple's benefit for a period of seven (7) years following termination of 
this Agreement.  SCI will clearly mark all of Apple's property its possession 
"Property of Apple Computer, Inc." (or substantially similar marking) and will
not use such property for any purpose other than to perform the services under 
this Agreement without Apple's prior consent.  SCI will keep an up to date 
inventory of all Apple property in its possession and provide a copy to Apple 
upon Apple's request.  Apple may, on forty-eight (48) hours prior notice, 
require that SCI return some or all of such property and, if it does so, SCI 
will immediately deliver all such property to Apple or, in Apple's discretion, 
permit Apple to take possession of such property wherever it is situated.  If 
Apple requires that SCI return of any Apple-owned property that is required to 
manufacture and deliver a Product, SCI will be relieved of its obligation to 
supply such Product to Apple.

21.	EXPORT/IMPORT COMPLIANCE 

21.1	Export Controlled Commodities, Technical Data and Software.  This 
	Agreement is subject to all laws, regulations, orders or other 
	limitations on the export and re-export of commodities, technical data
 	and software.  The parties hereby agrees that they will not export, 
	re-export, resell or transfer any export controlled commodity, 
	technical data or software (i) in violation of such limitations imposed
 	by the United States or any other appropriate national government 
	authority, or (ii) to any country for which an export license or other 
	governmental approval is required at the time of export, without first 
	obtaining all necessary licenses or other approvals.  SCI will make 
	records of all export transactions available to Apple upon Apple's 
	written request in order to permit Apple to confirm SCI's compliance 
	with its obligations under this Section.

					112
<PAGE>


21.2	Exporter of Record.  Unless the parties agree otherwise in the Product 
	Plan for particular Product(s), Apple will be the Exporter of Record 
	for all such Products manufactured at Fountain and Delivered to Apple 
	or its designee outside of the United States.  The Exporter of Record 
	will be responsible for obtaining necessary export licenses and other 
	government approvals required for export, and for preparing export 
	documentation such as commercial invoices, shipper's export 
	declarations, and international waybills.  Each party agrees to comply
	fully with the export control laws of the United States and with the 
	U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the U.S. Arms Export Control 
	Act when acting as the Exporter of Record.

21.3	Certificates of Delivery.  Upon Apple's request and at SCI's expense, 
	SCI will provide Apple:  (i) Certificates of Delivery to Apple for 
	Products imported into the United States by SCI and Delivered to Apple 
	in the United States as imported goods; and (ii) Certificates of 
	Manufacture and Delivery for Products imported and then further 
	manufactured by SCI and Delivered to Apple in the United States as 
	imported goods.  Each Certificate will describe the imported 
	merchandise and reference both Apple's and SCI's Part Numbers.  Apple 
	will use the Certificates only for the purpose of obtaining duty  
	drawbacks. 

21.4	Country of Origin Marking.  SCI certifies that articles manufactured 
	by SCI, or repacked by SCI, will conform with the U.S. Customs Marking 
	requirements as stated 19 U.S.C. 1304 and 19 CFR Part 134.

21.5	NAFTA.  SCI agrees to review, upon Apple's request, North American Free 
	Trade Agreement (NAFTA) eligibility of products or material shipped 
	directly from SCI to NAFTA qualifying country (eg:  U.S., Canada or 
	Mexico).  Apple agrees to cooperate in providing information reasonably 
	required by SCI to evaluate NAFTA eligibility of Products.  When 
	products are shipped directly from SCI's facility to a qualifying NAFTA
 	country, SCI will generate the supporting NAFTA certificate of origin 
	for the importer in such qualifying country.  In addition, SCI agrees 
	maintain documentation in support of all NAFTA certificates issued.  
	When goods are shipped to an Apple facility in the U.S., SCI agrees to 
	supply Apple, upon Apple's request, with a statement of NAFTA 
	qualification and maintain documentation in support of such statement.

22.	GENERAL TERMS

22.1	Force Majeure.  Neither party will be deemed in default of this 
	Agreement to the extent that performance of its obligations or attempts
 	to cure any breach are delayed or prevented by reason of any act of 
	God, fire, natural disaster, accident, act of government, or an act 
	that is beyond the reasonable control of either party, provided that 
	such party gives the other party written notice thereof promptly and, 
	in any event, within fifteen (15) days of discovery thereof and uses 
	its best efforts to continue to so perform or cure. In the event of 
	such a Force Majeure, the time for performance or cure will be extended

	advertisements or Exhibitions.

	be in writing, will reference this Agreement and will be deemed given 
	when: (i) delivered personally; (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or

	or written, between the parties. No amendment to or modification of 
	this Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by a duly 
	authorized representative of both parties.
