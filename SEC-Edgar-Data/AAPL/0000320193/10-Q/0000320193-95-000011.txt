             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results have been included.  All adjustments are  of  a  normal
   recurring nature unless specified in a separate note included  in  these
   Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The results  for  interim
   periods  are  not necessarily indicative of results to be  expected  for
   the  entire year.  These financial statements and notes should  be  read
   in   conjunction  with  the  Company's  annual  consolidated   financial
   statements  and  the notes thereto for the fiscal year  ended  September
   30,  1994, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   September 30, 1994 (the "1994 Form 10-K").

2. The   Company  lowered  its  estimates  of  the  total  remaining  costs
   associated  with its restructuring plan initiated in the  third  quarter
   of  1993  and recorded adjustments that increased income by $17  million
   ($11  million,  or  $0.09 per share, after taxes)  and  $6  million  ($4
   million,  or  $0.  03  per share, after taxes) in the  first  and  third
   quarters  of 1995, respectively.  These adjustments primarily  reflected
   favorable  cancellation settlements of certain R&D  project  commitments
   and  facility leases and the completion of other actions at lower  costs
   than originally estimated.

   At  June  30, 1995, the Company had $15 million of accrued restructuring
   costs  for  actions  that  are currently under  way.   Approximately  $6
   million  in  charges to the accrual are expected to be  incurred  during
   1995 with the remaining $9 million incurred beyond 1995.  Charges to  be
   incurred  beyond  1995  relate  primarily to  recurring  payments  under
   certain noncancelable operating leases.

3. Interest and other income (expense), net, consists of the following:

4. Effective  October  1,  1994, the Company adopted  Financial  Accounting
   Standard No. 115 (FAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in  Debt
   and  Equity  Securities".   In accordance with  FAS  115,  prior  period
   financial  statements have not been restated to reflect  the  change  in
   accounting  principle.   The cumulative effect of  the  change  was  not
   material to shareholders' equity as of October 1, 1994.  Under FAS  115,
   debt  securities that a company has both the positive intent and ability
   to  hold  to  maturity are carried at amortized cost.   Debt  securities
   that a company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold  to
   maturity  and all marketable equity securities are classified as  either
   available-for-sale   or  trading  and  are  carried   at   fair   value.
   Generally,  unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified
   as  available-for-sale  are  reported as a  component  of  shareholders'
   equity.   Unrealized  holding gains and losses on securities  classified
   as trading are included in earnings.

   The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily of  certificates  of
   deposit,  time  deposits and commercial paper with maturities  of  three
   months  or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term investments consist
   principally  of  commercial  paper with  maturities  between  three  and
   twelve  months.  The Company's marketable equity securities  consist  of
   securities  issued  by  U.S. corporations and  are  included  in  "Other
   assets"  on the accompanying balance sheet.  As of June 30,  1995,   the
   Company's   cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  marketable
   equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.

   The  adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding
   gains  (losses)  on available-for-sale cash equivalents  and  short-term
   investments  were not material either individually or in the  aggregate,
   at  June 30, 1995.  The net adjustment recorded to shareholders'  equity
   for  unrealized  holding  gains (losses) related  to  marketable  equity
   securities was an unrealized gain of approximately $39 million  at  June
   30, 1995.  The realized gains (losses) recorded to earnings on sales  of
   available-for-sale securities, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   were not material for the three and nine months ended June 30, 1995.

   5. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $391
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested   in  operations  outside  the  United  States.   It   is   not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely  invested earnings, the Company provides  for  federal  and
   state  income  taxes  currently  on undistributed  earnings  of  foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) has proposed  federal  income  tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company  has  made
   certain   prepayments  thereon.   The  Company  contested  the  proposed
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues  in
   dispute for these years  have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the  IRS
   issued  a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of  the
   Company's  federal  income taxes for the years 1989 through  1991.   The
   Company intends to file a petition with the United States Tax Court   to
   contest  these  alleged  tax  deficiencies.   Management  believes  that
   adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments  that  may  result
   from these tax examinations.

6. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options outstanding during the period.

7. Certain  prior year amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  and  the
   consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to  conform
   to the current period presentation.

8. On  July  18,  1995, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend  of
   $0.12  per share for the Company's third fiscal quarter ended  June  30,
   1995.  The dividend is payable on September 8, 1995, to shareholders  of
   record as of August 18, 1995.

Net  sales  for  the third quarter and first nine months of 1995  increased
over the comparable periods of 1994, primarily resulting from a combination
of  unit  growth,  higher average selling prices and  changes  in  currency
exchange  rates.  The increase in average selling prices was  driven  by  a
shift  in mix towards the Company's newer products and products with multi-
media  configurations.  Specifically, the Company recorded strong sales  of
products  within  its Performa(registered trademark) family and the Power 
Macintosh(Trademark)  family  ofpersonal  computers.  Increased sales of 
these products contributed  to  an increase in the average aggregate revenue 
per Macintosh(registered trademark) computer  unit  of
approximately  8%  and 14% in the third quarter and first  nine  months  of
1995,  respectively, over the comparable periods of 1994.  Total  Macintosh
computer  unit sales increased 20% and 12% in the third quarter  and  first
nine  months  of 1995, respectively, over the comparable periods  of  1994.
This  unit  sales  growth principally resulted from  strong  sales  of  the
Company's Power Macintosh products which account for over 50% of total unit
shipments at the end of the third quarter of 1995, compared with 27% in the
comparable  period  of  1994, and from newer product offerings  within  the
Performa  family  of  desktop personal computers.   This  unit  growth  was
partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the Company's  older
product offerings.

International  net  sales grew 24% and 26% in the third quarter  and  first
nine  months  of 1995, respectively, over the comparable periods  of  1994,
primarily  reflecting  strong  net sales  growth  in  the  Pacific  region,
particularly Japan, and favorable changes in currency exchange rates.   Net
sales  for  the third quarter and first nine months of 1995 grew moderately
in  Europe  over the comparable periods of 1994.  International  net  sales
represented 49% and 50% of total net sales for the third quarter and  first
nine months of 1995, respectively, compared with 47% and 48%, respectively,
for the corresponding periods of 1994.  Domestic net sales grew 16% in both
the  third  quarter and first nine months of 1995, respectively,  over  the
comparable periods of 1994, primarily resulting from strong growth  in  the
education and business markets.

In  general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an  as-
needed  basis.   Resellers frequently change delivery schedules  and  order
rates depending on changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ("backlog")
can  be,  and  often are, canceled at will.  The Company attempts  to  fill
orders  on the requested delivery schedules.  However, products may  be  in
relatively  short  supply from time to time until production  volumes  have
reached  a  level  sufficient to meet demand  or  if  other  production  or
fulfillment   constraints  exist.   The  Company's  backlog  increased   to
approximately  $1,047  million at August 4, 1995, from  approximately  $795
million  at  May  5, 1995, primarily due to backlog of the Company's  Power
Macintosh products.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time  is  not a meaningful indication of  its  future  business
prospects.   In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  of  or
immediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering
by  dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply  once
dealers and customers believe they

                                        8
<PAGE>

can  obtain sufficient supply.  Because of the foregoing, as well as  other
factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a
reliable   indicator   of  the  Company's  future  revenue   or   financial
performance.   Further information regarding the Company's backlog  may  be
found  under  Part  I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q under the heading  "Factors
that  May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition", which information
is hereby incorporated by reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and
its  cost  of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the  sale  of
products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for  its
products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based
primarily  on  the cost of components and to a lesser extent, direct  labor
costs.    The   type  and  cost  of  components  included   in   particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and  disk  drives)
are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations
competitive with other manufacturers.  Competition in the personal computer
industry is intense, and in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and
product  configuration are often necessary in order to remain  competitive.
Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly
influenced  in  the  short term by actions undertaken  by  the  Company  in
response to industry-wide competitive pressures.

Gross  margin  increased both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during the third quarter and first nine months of 1995, respectively,  over
the  comparable  periods  of  1994.  The increase  in  gross  margin  as  a
percentage  of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in  product  mix
towards  the  Company's  newer, high margin products  within  each  product
category  which  included  strong  sales of  certain  products  within  the
Company's entry-level Macintosh Performa family and of products within  its
Power Macintosh family of personal computers.

The  increase in gross margin levels was affected favorably by  changes  in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates as a result  of  a  weaker  U.S.  dollar
relative  to certain foreign currencies during the first, second and  third
quarters  of  1995 compared with the corresponding periods  of  1994.   The
Company's  operating  strategy and pricing take  into  account  changes  in
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations  can
be  significantly  affected in the short term by  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency exchange rates.

The  Company's  gross margin percentage improved from 26.2% in  the  second
quarter  of 1995 to 28.3% in the third quarter of 1995, resulting primarily
from  the introduction and sale of new products within the entry level  and
desktop product categories, including new Power Macintosh products, as well
as  from the impact of changes in currency exchange rates.  However, it  is
anticipated  that gross margins will remain under pressure and  could  fall
below  prior years' levels worldwide due to a variety of factors, including
continued  industry-wide  pricing  pressures,  increased  competition,  and
compressed product life cycles.

Research  and  development expenditures increased in amount  in  the  third
quarter  and first nine months of 1995 when compared with the corresponding
periods  of 1994, due to higher project- and headcount-related spending  as
the  Company  continues to invest in the development of  new  products  and
technologies.

As  a  percentage  of  net  sales, research  and  development  expenditures
remained  relatively consistent in the third quarter of 1995 when  compared
with   the   corresponding  period  of  1994.   Research  and   development
expenditures in the first nine months of 1995 decreased as a percentage  of
net  sales  when compared with the corresponding period of 1994,  primarily
due to the increase in the level of net sales.

The  Company  anticipates that research and development  expenditures  will
decrease as a percentage of net sales during the remaining quarter of 1995.

Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased in  amount  in  the
third  quarter  and  first  nine months of  1995  when  compared  with  the
corresponding  periods of 1994.  This increase was primarily  a  result  of
increased advertising and channel marketing program spending as the Company
continued its efforts to expand its market share.  Although the Company has
increased  its  selling and marketing expenses in an effort to  expand  its
market  share, there can be no assurance that such an increase in  spending
will  result  in  a corresponding increase in market share.   Despite  this
increase  in  expenditures,  selling, general and  administrative  expenses
remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales in the third  quarter
and  first nine months of 1995 when compared with the corresponding periods
of  1994,  primarily as a result of the increase in the level of net  sales
combined  with  the  Company's ongoing efforts to  manage  total  operating
expense growth.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses relative  to  gross  margin  levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross  margins, and continued competitive pressures worldwide.  The Company
anticipates that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase
in amount during the remaining quarter of 1995.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $12
million  in  income  in  the  third  quarter  of  1995  compared  with  the
corresponding  period  of  1994.   Higher cash  and  short-term  investment
balances  coupled  with  higher  investment  interest  rates  resulted   in
increased  interest income of approximately $15 million.  The  increase  in
income  was  partially offset by increased interest expense due  to  higher
borrowing  rates  and  increased hedging costs as  a  result  of  increased
volatility in the currency exchange markets as the value of the U.S. dollar
declined relative to other foreign currencies.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $16
million in expense in the first nine months of 1995 when compared with  the
corresponding  period of 1994.  Net losses recorded for the  mark-to-market
valuation  of  outstanding  currency forwards  and  sold  currency  options
undertaken  for  currency risk management purposes  and  costs  related  to
foreign  exchange  risk management activity during  the  second  and  third
quarters  of  1995  resulted  in increased expenses  of  approximately  $56
million  when  compared  with  the corresponding  periods  of  1994.   This
increase  in  expense  was partially offset by an approximate  $41  million
increase in interest and other income, net, during the first nine months of
1995 when compared with the corresponding period of 1994, reflecting higher
cash  and  short-term  investment balances coupled with  higher  investment
interest rates.

Notional  principal  amounts on certain of the Company's  foreign  exchange
instruments increased significantly compared with the balances at September
30,  1994,  in  accordance  with  the Company's  currency  risk  management
strategies.  Specifically, notional principal amounts on purchased and sold
foreign   exchange   options  not  accounted  for   as   hedges   increased
approximately  $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively,  compared  with
the balances at September 30. 1994.  The notional principal amounts for off-
balance-sheet  instruments provide one measure of  the  transaction  volume
outstanding at a particular point in time, and do not necessarily represent
the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market risk.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on  the Company's ability to successfully develop,  manufacture,
and  market  technologically innovative products in order to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future operating results and financial condition.

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's  ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the  availability of application software for new products,  the  effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and
the manufacturing of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated
demand.  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.

In  1994,  the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of  Macintosh
computers  based  on  a  new PowerPC family of RISC  microprocessors.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition may  be  adversely
affected  if  it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its
lines  of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series  of
microprocessors  to  the  PowerPC(registered trademark) microprocessor.   
The  success  of  this ongoing transition will depend on the Company's 
ability to continue to sell products  based  on  the  Motorola 68000 series
of  microprocessors  while gaining  market acceptance of the new PowerPC 
processor-based products,  to successfully  manage inventory levels of both 
product lines simultaneously, and  to  continue to coordinate the timely 
development and distribution  by independent   software  vendors  of  new  
"native"  software   applications specifically designed for the PowerPC 
processor-based products.

The  rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new
product  is  not necessarily an indication of the future rate of  shipments
for  that  product, which depends on many factors, some of  which  are  not
under  the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to  purchase
new  technology  prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users  ("early
adopters");  purchases  in  satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by  users  who
anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of  other
products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to  the
aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,
such as the deferral of purchases by many users until new

                                       11
<PAGE>

technology  is  accepted as "proven" and for which commonly  used  software
products  are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers  once  they
believe they can obtain sufficient supply of product previously in backlog.

Backlog  is  often  volatile after new product  introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned  demand  factors, often increasing sharply  coincident  with
introduction, and then reducing sharply once dealers and customers  believe
they can obtain sufficient supply of product.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability  of  European-language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial  demand for the Company's new products  outside  the  United
States,  even  though localized versions of the Company's products  may  be
available.

Competition

The  personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues  to  be
characterized  by  consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,
aggressive pricing practices, and downward pressure on gross margins.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected  should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact  of
industry-wide pricing pressures.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected   by   the  Company's  ability  to  offer  customers   competitive
technologies while effectively managing the impact on inventory levels  and
the potential for customer confusion created by product proliferation.

On  November  7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with  International
Business  Machines Corporation (IBM) and Motorola, Inc. on a  new  hardware
reference  platform  for the PowerPC microprocessor  that  is  intended  to
deliver a much wider range of operating system and application choices  for
computer customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company intends  to
make  the  Macintosh  operating system available on  the  common  platform.
Accordingly,    the  Company's  future  operating  results  and   financial
condition  may  be affected by its ability to implement this agreement  and
certain  other  collaboration  agreements, and  to  manage  the  associated
competitive risk.

The  Company  is  currently the primary maker of  hardware  that  uses  the
Macintosh  operating  system, and it has a minority  market  share  in  the
personal  computer market, which is dominated by makers of  computers  that
run the MS-DOS(registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows(trademark) 
operating systems.  Future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by the Company's ability to increase  market share in its personal 
computer business.  As part  of  its efforts  to  increase  overall  market 
share,  the  Company  announced  the licensing  of  the  Macintosh operating
system to other  personal  computer vendors  in January 1995, and several 
vendors are currently selling product
which  utilizes the Macintosh operating system.  The Company's  efforts  to
increase  its  overall  market share through  licensing  of  the  Macintosh
operating  system  will  depend in part on the  success  of  the  Company's
ability  to manage the risks associated with competing companies  producing
Macintosh  OS-based  computer  systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot
determine  the  ultimate effect that licensing of the  Macintosh  operating
system  will  have  on  its product sales or future operating  results  and
financial  condition.   The Company believes that licensing  the  operating
system  will  result in a broader installed base on which software  vendors
can  develop and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh  platform.
However,  there  can  be  no  assurance that the  installed  base  will  be
broadened by the licensing of the operating system or result in an increase
in  the  number of application software titles or the rate at which vendors
will  bring to market application software based on the Macintosh operating
system.

The  Company's principal competitor in producing operating system software,
Microsoft  Corporation, is a large, well-financed corporation which  has  a
dominant  position  in various segments of the personal  computer  software
industry.  Microsoft Corporation is expected to release Windows 95, another
of  its operating system offerings, in the next several weeks.  The Company
believes  that  this event will likely create competitive pressure  on  the
Company and will further challenge the Company's efforts in developing  and
marketing  the  Company's  products.   Accordingly,  the  Company's  future
operating  results and financial condition could be adversely  affected  by
the release of Windows 95.

Certain  of the Company's personal computer products are capable of running
application software designed for the MS-DOS or

                                       12
<PAGE>

Windows  operating systems, through software emulation of Intel Corporation
microprocessor  chips  by  use of software specifically  designed  for  the
Company's  products,  either those based on the Motorola  68000  series  of
microprocessors or those based on the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  Company
has  also introduced products which include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601
microprocessor  and  the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor which  enable  users  to
switch between Macintosh and DOS computing environments.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed  to  MS-DOS  or  Windows-based systems,  are  often  based  on  the
availability  of  third-party  software for particular  applications.   The
Company  believes that the availability of third-party application software
for  the  Company's  hardware products depends in part on  the  third-party
developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of  developing
such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger MS-
DOS  and  Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors  such  as  the
relative  market share of the Company's products, the anticipated potential
revenue  that  may  be  earned, and the costs of developing  such  software
products.   Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of  application
software for the Company's products.  Accordingly, Microsoft's interest  in
producing application software for the Company's products may be influenced
by Microsoft's perception of its interests as an operating system vendor.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
new  PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors which produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by  most personal computers  using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows  operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based  on  the
Intel microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also
the  developer  of  OS/2,  a competing operating system  to  the  Company's
Macintosh  operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying  the
Company  with  improved  versions  of  microprocessors  for  the  Company's
products  may  be  influenced by IBM's perception of  its  interests  as  a
competing  manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing  operating
system vendor.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by  the  Company's   ability  to  successfully  expand  its   new
businesses  and product offerings into other markets, such as  the  markets
for on-line services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.

Global Market Risks

A  large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international
operations.   As  a result, the Company's operations and financial  results
could  be significantly affected by international factors, such as  changes
in  foreign  currency  exchange rates or weak economic  conditions  in  the
foreign  markets in which the Company distributes its products.   When  the
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value  of
non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens,  the
U.S.    dollar   value   of   non-U.S.   dollar-based   sales    increases.
Correspondingly,  the  U.S.  dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based  costs
increases  when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S.  dollar
strengthens.   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of  currencies  other
than  the  U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar  and  is
adversely  affected  by  a  stronger dollar relative  to  major  currencies
worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may  negatively  affect
the  Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed  in  U.S.
dollars).

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on
the   Company's  non-U.S.  dollar-based  sales,  product  procurement,  and
operating  expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based
exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange  forward
and  option  contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.   Currently,
hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The
Company  also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge  certain
other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,
but  not  firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.   To
reduce  the  costs  associated with these ongoing foreign exchange  hedging
programs,  the  Company  also  regularly  sells  foreign  exchange   option
contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All
foreign  exchange forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges,
including all transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the
Company's foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value  and
are adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.

While  the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the  interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's  leading  industrialized  countries,  the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations  in
the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard,

                                       13
<PAGE>

changes  in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid
on its short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact of
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into  interest
rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps are intended  to
better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash,  cash
equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest  rate
swap,  swaption, and option transactions in order to extend  the  effective
duration  of  a  portion  of  its  cash, cash  equivalent,  and  short-term
investment portfolios. These swaps may extend the Company's cash investment
horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.

To  ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange
and  interest  rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor  the  risks  and
opportunities of the non hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors
its  foreign  exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate
swap,  swaption,  and  option  positions on  a  stand-alone  basis  and  in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related
exposures,   respectively,  from  both  an  accounting  and   an   economic
perspective.   However, given the effective horizons of the Company's  risk
management  activities, there can be no assurance that  the  aforementioned
programs  will  offset more than a portion of the adverse financial  impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of  gains
and  losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period  may
not  coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying
economic  exposures,  and  as  such, may  adversely  affect  the  Company's
operating results and financial position.

Inventory and Supply

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited  by
the  availability  of  key  components.   The  Company  believes  that  the
availability   from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer   industry   of
microprocessors,  application  specific integrated  circuits  (ASIC's)  and
dynamic  random access memory (DRAM) present the most significant potential
for  constraining  the  Company's ability  to  produce  product.   Specific
microprocessors  manufactured by Motorola,  Inc.,  and  IBM  are  currently
available only from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors are
currently  in  the  early stages of ramp-up for production  and  thus  have
limited availability.  The current market for DRAM is very constrained, and
competition  for  DRAM  among producers of personal computers  is  intense,
based  in  part  on  the  increased requirements for  DRAM  made  by  newer
operating  systems such as Windows 95.  The Company and other producers  in
the  personal  computer  industry  also  compete  for  other  semiconductor
products  with other industries that have experienced increased demand  for
such  products due to either increased consumer demand or increased use  of
semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and automotive
industries.)  Finally, the Company uses some components that are not common
to  the  rest of the personal computer industry (including certain  ASICs).
Continued  availability of these components may be  affected  if  producers
were  to  decide  to  concentrate on the production  of  common  components
instead  of custom components.  The Company's future operating results  and
financial condition could be adversely affected by such product constraints
and increased costs, including loss of market share.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage inventory levels  and
lead times required to obtain components in order to be more responsive  to
short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In addition, if anticipated
unit  sales  growth for new and current product offerings is not  realized,
inventory  valuation reserves may be necessary that would adversely  affect
the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution of
the  Company's  products.   Currently,  the  Company's  primary  means   of
distribution  is  through  third-party computer  resellers.   However,  the
Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels, such as
mass-merchandise   stores  consumer  electronics  outlets,   and   computer
superstores.   The  Company's  business  and  financial  results  could  be
adversely  affected if the financial condition of these sellers weakens  or
if  sellers  within consumer channels decide not to continue to  distribute
the Company's products.

Other Factors

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

The Company plans to replace its current transaction systems (which include
order management, distribution, manufacturing, and

                                       14
<PAGE>

finance)  with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort  to
increase  operational efficiency.  The Company's future  operating  results
and  financial  condition could be adversely affected  by  its  ability  to
implement  and  effectively manage the transition to  this  new  integrated
system.

In April 1995, the Company announced a company-wide reorganization designed
to  more  closely  align the Company's organizational  structure  with  the
Company's  business strategy of placing increased focus on  customer  needs
and  expanding  its presence in the home, education, and business  markets.
The  Company's  future operating results and financial condition  could  be
adversely  affected by its ability to effectively manage the transition  to
this new organizational structure.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Cash,  cash  equivalents and short-term          
investments, net of short-term borrowings     $1,270

Cash generated by operations                    $433

excluding short-term investments                $133
                                                
Cash generated by financing activities          $118
                                        
The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments, net of short-term borrowings increased  to  $1,270
million  at  June 30, 1995 from $966 million at September 30,  1994.   This
increase  was primarily attributable to the Company's continued efforts  to
increase profit levels and to manage working capital, particularly  in  the
areas of inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable.

Cash  generated by operations during the first nine months of 1995  totaled
$433  million.  Cash was generated primarily by higher sales levels related
to  a  shift in product mix towards higher-margin products which  typically
have higher average selling prices.

Net  cash  used  for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  totaled
approximately  $110 million during the first nine months  of  1995.   These
purchases  primarily included manufacturing machinery and  equipment.   The
Company  anticipates that capital expenditures in 1995 will  be  relatively
consistent with 1994 expenditures of $160 million.

Short-term  borrowings  at  June 30, 1995 were approximately  $114  million
higher than at September 30, 1994.  These borrowings were primarily made to
fund  expected  working  capital growth in certain markets  worldwide.   In
general,  the Company's short-term borrowings typically reflect  borrowings
made under its commercial paper program and short-term uncommitted bid-line
arrangements  with certain commercial banks.  In particular,  Apple  Japan,
Inc., and Apple Computer BV, (Netherlands) wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company,  incurred  short-term  borrowings  from  several  banks,  totaling
approximately  $233  million and $173 million, respectively,  at  June  30,
1995.

Long-term  borrowings of $303 million at June 30, 1995 remained  consistent
with the balance at September 30, 1994.  Substantially the entire amount of
long-term borrowings represents $300 million aggregate principal amount  of
6.5%  unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration  statement
filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.   This  shelf
registration  covers the registration of debt and other securities  for  an
aggregate  offering price of up to $500 million.  The notes  were  sold  at
99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay
interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short-  and  long-term
borrowings  from  time  to time generally to finance U.S.  working  capital
needs  and  capital  expenditures, because a  substantial  portion  of  the
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term

                                       15
<PAGE>

investments   is   held  by  foreign  subsidiaries,   generally   in   U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be
subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States; the
Company's  financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability
on amounts that it reasonably expects may be repatriated.

The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  has  proposed  federal  income  tax
deficiencies  for  the years 1984 through 1991, and the  Company  has  made
certain   prepayments   thereon.   The  Company  contested   the   proposed
deficiencies  for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of  the  issues  in
dispute  for  these years  have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995,  the  IRS
issued  a  notice of deficiency proposing increases to the  amount  of  the
Company's  federal  income  taxes for the years  1989  through  1991.   The
Company  intends to file a petition with the United States  Tax  Court   to
contest  these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these  tax
examinations.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.


PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 39 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-
K  under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain litigation
involving Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company.

In  the  case of Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-
Packard Company, the Company's petition for a writ of certiorari was denied
by   the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  on  February  21,  1995.
Accordingly, the decision of the appellate court affirming the dismissal of
the  Company's  copyright infringement case against  Microsoft  Corporation
("Microsoft")  and  Hewlett-Packard Company  ("HP")  is  now  final.   HP's
request  for  attorneys'  fees has been settled by  agreement  between  the
Company and HP.  Microsoft's request for attorneys' fees remains pending.

The  Company believes the resolution of the above matter will  not  have  a
material  adverse  effect  on  its  financial  condition  and  results   of
operations as reported in the accompanying financial statements.   However,
depending  on  the  amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution  of  the
matter,  it is possible that the Company's future results of operations  or
cash flows could be materially affected in a particular period.

EXHIBIT 10.A.19-1
                                SUPPLEMENT TO THE
                                        
                  APPLE COMPUTER, INC. EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
                                        
                            (Effective June 9, 1995)
                                        
SECTION 1.     ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.

           This  Supplement  (the "Supplement") to the  Apple  Computer,  Inc.
Executive  Severance Plan (the "Plan") is hereby established effective  as  of
the date it is approved by the Board of Directors of Apple (the "Board").  The
purpose  of  this Supplement is to set forth the terms and provisions  of  the
Plan  that  will  apply  in  the  event of  a  Change  in  Control  of  Apple.
Capitalized  words  not  otherwise defined  herein  shall  have  the  meanings
assigned to such words in the Plan.

SECTION 2.     ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.

          (a)  Each Eligible Employee (i) whose employment with the Company is
involuntary  terminated by the Company for any reason  during  the  Supplement
Term,  other than due to such Employee's misuse of confidential or proprietary
information or a violation of the standards described in Apple's Global Ethics
brochure or any other Apple policy or guideline or (ii) who resigns during the
Supplement  Term  for  Good Reason shall automatically become  a  Participant,
whether  or not such person is designated as a Participant in accordance  with
Section 3.1 of the Plan (hereinafter, a "Section 2(a) Participant"); provided,
however,  that no Eligible Employee described in Section 3.3(c), (d),  (e)  or
(f),  or  an  Eligible Employee described in Section 3.3(b) who resigns  other
than  for  Good Reason, shall become a Section 2(a) Participant.  In addition,
during the Supplement Term, the definition of "Eligible Employee" in the  Plan
is  revised  to exclude reference to "any other plan, program or  practice  by
which  Apple  provides any separation allowance" which is  established  on  or
after the Change in Control Date or which is implemented at any time with  the
intention,  express or implied, of eliminating Apple's obligations  under  the
Plan  or  this Supplement. Employees of the Company who are otherwise Eligible
Employees  and who are parties to a Retention Agreement shall continue  to  be
eligible  to  be  designated as Participants in the Plan if  their  employment
terminates prior to the Change in Control Date or after the expiration of  the
term of their Retention Agreement.

           (b)   Section 4.1(e) of the Plan is revised to prohibit the Company
from  ending  the  Termination Notice Period for any such  Termination  Notice
Period  that begins within the Supplement Term for any reason other  than  the
Section  2(a) Participant's misuse of confidential or proprietary  information
or a violation of the standards described in Apple's Global Ethics brochure or
any other Apple policy or guideline.

          (c)  Section 4.3 of the Plan is revised to substitute "30 additional
calendar  days"  for "14 additional calendar days" for any Termination  Notice
Period that begins during the Supplemental Term.

           (d)   Section 4.5 of the Plan is revised to require the Company  to
provide   job  placement  assistance  or  counseling  to  each  Section   2(a)
Participant  who  requests  such  assistance;  provided,  however,  that   the
individual Participant cost to Apple of providing such benefits to  a  Section
2(a) Participant need not exceed $7,500.

           (e)   Section  7.1  of the Plan is revised for  each  Section  2(a)
Participant as follows:

Years of Service*    Months of Pay
                    
3 or less                   8

11 or more                 24 (maximum)
    
           
 *Years of Service will be determined as of the Participant's 
  actual termination date.
                                       19
           (f)   Section  7.2  of the Plan is revised for  each  Section  2(a)
Participant  as  follows:  In lieu of the Prorated Bonus,  each  Section  2(a)
Participant  shall  receive a special severance bonus (the "Severance  Bonus")
equal  to  the  greater of (i) the target annual bonus amount payable  to  the
Section  2(a)  Participant for the fiscal year in which the Notification  Date
occurs  and  (ii) the target annual bonus amount payable to the  Section  2(a)
Participant  for  the last fiscal year ended prior to the  Change  in  Control
Date,  in  either  case,  calculated on the  assumption  that  all  applicable
performance  targets  had been achieved.  The Severance  Bonus  shall  not  be
subject  to  any  proration and shall otherwise be payable at  such  time  and
manner as the Prorated Bonus.

           (g)   Section  7.3  of the Plan is revised for  each  Section  2(a)
Participant as follows:

Participant's Grade      Period   of   Extended

at Close of              Close  of  Termination
Termination Notice       Notice Period
Period
                         
97-100                   24 months
94-96                    18 months
                
          (h)  The additional payments and benefits provided by this Section 2
of  the  Supplement  are  subject  to the  condition  that  the  Section  2(a)
Participant execute a release in the form and manner contemplated  by  Section
5.2 of the Plan.

SECTION 3.     GROSS-UP PAYMENT.

          A new Section 7.8 is added to the Plan as follows:

          7.8   Gross-Up Payment.

           (a)  Right to Payment.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the
Supplement  to  the  contrary, if it is determined  that  any  Payment  to  an
Eligible  Employee (whether or not such employee qualifies for benefits  under
the  Plan or the Supplement and whether or not such employee is a Section 2(a)
Participant at the time of determination) would be subject to the  excise  tax
imposed  by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with respect
to  such  excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties
thereon,  is  herein  referred  to as an "Excise  Tax"),  then  such  Eligible
Employee shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")  in
an  amount  that  will  place such Eligible Employee  in  the  same  after-tax
economic position that such employee would have enjoyed if the Excise Tax  had
not  applied  to  the Payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up  Payment  shall  be
determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula {(E  x  (1  -
M)/(1  -  T))  -  E}  (or  such  other formula as the  Accounting  Firm  deems
appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

          E    equals   the  Payments  which  are  determined  to  be  "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of
               the Code;
     
          M    equals  the  sum  of  the  highest marginal  rates1  for  Taxes
               applicable to the Eligible Employee at the time of the Payment;
               and

          T    equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable to an Eligible Employee hereunder if the
Accounting Firm determines that the Payments to such Eligible Employee are not
subject to an Excise Tax.

           (b)   Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the provisions
of  Section  7.8(c),  all  determinations required  under  this  Section  7.8,
including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the  Payments
constituting  excess  parachute  payments, and  the  amount  of  the  Gross-Up
Payment,  shall  be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide  detailed
supporting  calculations both to the Eligible Employee and the Company  within
fifteen  days  of  the  Change  in Control Date,  the  date  of  the  Eligible
Employee's termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries  or
any other date reasonably requested by the Eligible Employee or the Company on
which  a  determination under this Section 3 is necessary or  advisable.   The
Company shall pay each Eligible Employee the initial Gross-Up Payment within 5
days  of  the  receipt by the Company of the Accounting Firm's  determination.
If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable to an Eligible
Employee  (or  class  of  Eligible Employees), the  Company  shall  cause  the
Accounting Firm to provide such Eligible Employee (or each member of the class
of   Eligible  Employees)  with  an  opinion  that  the  Accounting  Firm  has
substantial authority under the Code and Regulations not to report

                                       20

<PAGE>

an  Excise  Tax  on the Eligible Employee's federal income  tax  return.   Any
determination  by  the  Accounting Firm shall be  binding  upon  the  Eligible
Employee and the Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient  to
cover  the amount of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be  owing
by  the  Eligible  Employee  with  respect  to  any  Payment  (hereinafter  an
"Underpayment"),  the  Company, after exhausting its  remedies  under  Section
7.8(c) below, shall promptly pay to the Eligible Employee an additional Gross-
Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

          (c)  Procedures.  As a condition to Apple's obligations hereunder to
an Eligible Employee, each Eligible Employee shall be required to notify Apple
in  writing  of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful,
would  require  the payment by Apple of a Gross-Up Payment  by  such  Eligible
Employee.   Such  notice  shall  be given as soon  as  practicable  after  the
Eligible Employee knows of such claim and shall apprise Apple of the nature of
the  claim  and  the  date on which the claim is requested  to  be  paid.   An
Eligible Employee shall agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the
thirty-day  period following the date on which the Eligible Employee  notifies
Apple,  or  such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect  to
such  claim  are  due  (the "Notice Period"). If Apple notifies  the  Eligible
Employee  in  writing  prior to the expiration of the Notice  Period  that  it
desires to contest the claim, the Eligible Employee shall:  (i) give Apple any
information  reasonably requested by Apple relating to the  claim;  (ii)  take
such  action  in  connection with the claim as Apple may  reasonably  request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect  to
such  claim  by  an  attorney  reasonably selected  by  Apple  and  reasonably
acceptable to the Eligible Employee; (iii) cooperate with Apple in good  faith
in  contesting  the  claim;  and  (iv) permit  Apple  to  participate  in  any
proceedings relating to the claim.  An Eligible Employee shall permit Apple to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit  Apple
to  pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings,
and  conferences  with  the taxing authority in respect  of  such  claim.   If
requested  by Apple, an Eligible Employee shall agree either to  pay  the  tax
claimed  and  sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible  manner
and  to  prosecute  such contest to a determination before any  administrative
tribunal,  in  a  court of initial jurisdiction and in one or  more  appellate
courts  as  Apple shall determine; provided, however, that, if  Apple  directs
such  Eligible  Employee to pay such claim and pursue a  refund,  Apple  shall
advance  the  amount of such payment to the Eligible Employee on an  after-tax
and  interest-free  basis (the "Advance").  Apple's  control  of  the  contest
related  to  the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the  Gross-Up
Payment  and the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as
the  case  may be, any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service  or
other  taxing  authority.  If Apple does not notify the Eligible  Employee  in
writing  prior  to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to  contest  the
claim, Apple shall pay to the Eligible Employee an additional Gross-Up Payment
in respect of the excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim,
and  the  Eligible Employee shall be required to pay the amount of the  Excise
Tax  that  is  the subject of the claim to the applicable taxing authority  in
accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by an Eligible Employee of  an
Advance,  the Eligible Employee becomes entitled to a refund with  respect  to
the claim to which such Advance relates, the Eligible Employee shall pay Apple
the  amount of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon
after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by Eligible Employee of an
Advance,  a  determination is made that the Eligible  Employee  shall  not  be
entitled  to any refund with respect to the claim and Apple does not  promptly
notify  the  Eligible Employee of its intent to contest the denial of  refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by Eligible
Employee  and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of  the  additional
Gross-Up Payment then owing to the Eligible Employee.

           (e)   Further  Assurances.   Apple shall  indemnify  each  Eligible
Employee and hold each Eligible Employee harmless, on an after-tax basis, from
any   costs,   expenses,  penalties,  fines,  interest  or  other  liabilities
("Losses")  incurred by the Eligible Employee with respect to the exercise  by
Apple  of  any  of  its  rights  under this Section  7.8,  including,  without
limitation, any Losses related to Apple's decision to contest a claim  or  any
imputed  income to the Eligible Employee resulting from any Advance or  action
taken on Eligible Employee on behalf by Apple hereunder.  Apple shall pay  all
legal  fees  and expenses incurred under this Section 7.8, and shall  promptly
reimburse each Eligible Employee for the reasonable expenses incurred  by  the
Eligible Employee in connection with any actions taken by Apple or required to
be  taken by the Eligible Employee hereunder.  Apple shall also pay all of the
fees  and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without limitation,  the
fees and expenses related to the opinion referred to in Section 7.8(b).

           (f)   Combined  Payments.   Anything in this  Section  7.8  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, Apple shall have no obligation to pay  an  Eligible
Employee  a required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 7.8 if the  aggregate
amount  of all Combined Payments has at the time such payment is due  exceeded
the  Limit.  If the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to an Eligible Employee under
this  Section 7.8 would result in the Combined Payments exceeding  the  Limit,
Apple  shall  pay the Eligible Employee the portion, if any, of  the  Gross-Up
Payment  which  can  be  paid to such employee without causing  the  aggregate
amount  of  all Combined Payments to exceed the Limit.  In the event  that  an
Eligible Employee is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 7.8 and
other employees or former employees of the Company are also entitled to gross-
up  payments  under this Section 7.8 or under the corresponding provisions  of
any other applicable Combined Arrangement and the aggregate amount of all such
payments  would  cause the Limit on Combined Payments to  be  exceeded,  Apple
shall  allocate the amount of the reduction necessary to comply with the Limit
among  all such payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-
up  payment  bears to the aggregate amount of all such payments.   Nothing  in
this Section 7.8(f) shall require any Eligible Employee to repay to Apple  any
amount that was previously paid to such employee under this Section 7.8.

SECTION 4.     AMENDMENT AND ASSUMPTION.

           (a)  Section 12.1 of the Plan is revised as follows:  The Plan  and
this  Supplement may not be amended or terminated by Apple on  and  after  the
occurrence  of  the  Change in Control Date in any way that  would  reduce  or
eliminate  the payments and benefits owing under the Plan and this  Supplement
to  any  Section  2(a) Participant.  In addition, no amendment or  termination
which  would be precluded under the previous sentence if made on or after  the
Change  in  Control Date shall be effective if made or first effective  within
the twelve month period ending on the Change in Control Date.

           (b)   Apple will require any successor (whether direct or indirect,
by  purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially  all
of the business or assets of Apple expressly to assume and to agree to perform
this  Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Apple would  be
required  to  perform  it  if no such succession had  taken  place;  provided,
however,  that  no  such  assumption shall relieve Apple  of  its  obligations
hereunder.

SECTION 5.     DEFINITIONS.

           For  purposes  of  the  Plan  and this  Supplement,  the  following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

           "Accounting Firm" shall mean [NAME] or, if such firm is  unable  or

shall  be  designated by Apple in accordance with the terms of  the  Retention
Agreements.

            "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of Apple  of  a
nature  that  would be required to be reported in response  to  Item  6(e)  of
Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether  or
not  Apple  is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided,  however,
that, anything in the Plan or this Supplement to the contrary notwithstanding,
a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

           (i)   any  individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust,  unincorporated organization or other entity  or  person,  or  any
     syndicate  or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2)  of  the
     Exchange  Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined  in  Rule
     13d-3  of  the  General Rules and Regulations under  the  Exchange  Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of Apple representing 30%  or  more
     of  the  combined  voting  power of Apple's then  outstanding  securities
     entitled to vote in the election of directors of Apple;
     
           (ii)  during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including
     any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who  at
     the beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new directors,
     whose  election  by  the  Board or nomination  for  election  by  Apple's
     stockholders was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of
     the  directors  then  still in office who either were  directors  at  the
     beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election  was
     previously so approved (the "Incumbent Directors"), cease for any  reason
     to constitute a majority thereof;
     
           (iii)      There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation  or
     other  corporate transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),  in
     each  case,  with  respect  to  which the  stockholders  of  the  Company
     immediately  prior  to  such Transaction do not,  immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power of the
     Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
     
           (iv)  all  or  substantially all of the assets of Apple  are  sold,
     liquidated or distributed; or
     
           (v)  there is a "change in control" of Apple within the meaning  of
     Section 280G of the Code and the Regulations.
     
           "Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the date on
which  the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date on which Apple executes  an
agreement,  the  consummation of which would result in  the  occurrence  of  a
Change  in Control, (iii) the date the Board approves a transaction or  series
of transactions, the consummation of which would result in a Change in Control
and  (iv) the date Apple fails to satisfy its obligations to have the Plan and
this  Supplement assumed by any successor to Apple in accordance with  Section
4(b) of this Supplement.  If the Change in Control Date occurs as a result  of
an  agreement described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as a result
of  the  approval  of  the Board described in clause  (iii)  of  the  previous
sentence and the Change in Control to which such agreement or approval relates
(the  "Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then  the
Supplement Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date")  following
the  date  the  Board  certifies by resolution duly adopted  by  three-fourths
(3/4ths)  of  the  Incumbent Directors then in office  that  the  Contemplated
Change  in Control is not reasonably likely to occur; provided, however,  that
this  sentence  shall  not  apply (A) to any Section  2(a)  Participant  whose
termination of employment with Apple has occurred on and after the  Change  in
Control Date and on or prior to the Reset Date or (B) if the

                                       22
<PAGE>

Contemplated Change in Control subsequently occurs within three months of  the
Reset  Date.  Following the Reset Date, the provisions of the  Plan  and  this
Supplement  shall  remain in effect and a new Supplement Term  shall  commence
upon  the  occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding
the  first  sentence of this section, if an individual's employment  with  the
Company  terminates prior to the Change in Control Date and it  is  reasonably
demonstrated that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of the
third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change  in
Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation  of  the
Change in Control, then, solely with respect to the affected Participant,  the
Change  in Control Date shall mean the date immediately prior to the  date  of
such Participant's termination of employment.

           "Combined Arrangements" shall mean this Supplement to the Plan  (as
the same may be amended from time to time) and the Retention Agreements.

           "Combined  Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash  amount  of  (i)
severance payments made to employees or former employees under Section 3(a) of
the  Retention  Agreements or the corresponding provisions of  the  applicable
Combined   Arrangement,  (ii)  severance  payments  made   to   Section   2(a)
Participants  under Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or to  any  other
employee  or  former  employee  under  the  corresponding  provisions  of  the
applicable  Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-up Payments made to an  Eligible
Employee under Section 3 of the Supplement or to any other employee or  former
employee  under  the  corresponding  provisions  of  the  applicable  Combined
Arrangement, (iv) fees and expenses which are paid or reimbursed to  employees
or  former  employees under Section 6 of the Retention Agreements  or  to  any
other  employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions  of  the
applicable  Combined  Arrangement, (v) payments made to  employees  or  former
employees under Section 5 of the Retention Agreements or to any other employee
or  former  employee  under  the corresponding provisions  of  the  applicable
Combined Arrangement and (vi) costs incurred by Apple in respect of a  Section
2(a) Participant under Section 2(d) of the Supplement or to any other employee
or  former  employee  under  the corresponding provisions  of  the  applicable
Combined Arrangement.

          "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and

     from the CIC Location or the Company's requiring an Eligible Employee  to
     be  based  more than fifty (50) miles away from the CIC Location  (except
     for  required travel on the Company's business to an extent substantially
     consistent  with  your  customary  business  travel  obligations  in  the
     ordinary course of business prior to the Change in Control Date); or
     
           (ii) The Company's assignment of an Eligible Employee to a job with
     significantly  reduced  duties and responsibilities  and  which  involves
     either   (A) a reduction in the Eligible Employee's base salary or target
     bonus  opportunity  or  (B)  a drop of two grade  designations  or  more;
     provided,  however, that clause (B) shall not apply if the  reduction  in
     employee's grade designation causes such employee to cease to qualify  as
     an Eligible Employee for purposes of the Plan and this Supplement;
     
provided,  however,  that an event described above shall not  constitute  Good
Reason  unless it is communicated by the Eligible Employee to the  Company  in
writing  and  is not corrected by the Company in a manner which is  reasonably
satisfactory  to the Eligible Employee (including full retroactive  correction
with  respect to any monetary matter) within 10 days of the Company's  receipt
of such written notice.

           "Limit" shall mean the dollar amount determined in accordance  with

               and
          
          C    equals the greater of (i) (A) if the Common Stock is listed  on
               any  established  stock  exchange  or  national  market  system
               (including, without limitation, the National Market  System  of
               the  National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
               Quotation ("NASDAQ") System, the highest closing sale price (or
               closing  bid  price, if no sales are reported) of  a  share  of
               Common Stock, or (B) if the Common Stock is

               market system) or quoted by a recognized securities dealer  but
               selling  prices are not reported, the highest mean between  the
               high  and low asked prices for the Common Stock, in each  case,
               on any day during the ninety-day period ending on the Change in
               Control  Date, and (ii) the highest price paid or  offered,  as
               determined by the Accounting Firm, in any bona fide transaction

             "Notification Date" shall mean, during the Supplement  Term,  the
date  an Eligible Employee is notified of his or her termination of employment
or  the end of the date on which the cure period referred to in the definition
of  Good Reason expires without the Company effecting the cure contemplated by
such definition.

           "Payment" means (i) any amount due or paid to an Eligible  Employee
under  the Plan or this Supplement, (ii) any amount that is due or paid to  an
Eligible  Employee under any plan, program or arrangement of the Company,  and
(iii)  any  amount  or benefit that is due or payable to an Eligible  Employee

EXHIBIT 10.A.21

                             DATA List of Officers


June 9, 1995
Mr. "Name"
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, California 95014

                                        
                               Retention Agreement


Dear "First name":

           Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation  (the "Company"),
considers  it essential to the best interests of its stockholders  to  take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty  and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change  in
control  of  the  Company could result in the departure or  distraction  of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

           The  Board  has  determined, therefore, that  appropriate  steps
should  be  taken  to reinforce and encourage the continued  attention  and
dedication   of  members  of  the  management  of  the  Company   and   its
subsidiaries,   including  yourself,  to  their  assigned  duties   without
distraction  in  the  face of potentially disturbing circumstances  arising
from any possible change in control of the Company.

           In  order to induce you to remain in the employ of the  Company,
the  Company  has  determined  to enter into this  letter  agreement  (this
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in
the  event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words  which
are  not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to  such
words in Section 8 of this Agreement.

           1.    Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of  your
employment  under  this Agreement shall commence on the Change  in  Control
Date  and  shall  continue until the second anniversary of  the  Change  in
Control Date (the "Term").

           2.   Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

          (a)  Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, nature
and  status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no  less
favorable  to  you  than those that you enjoyed immediately  prior  to  the
Change in Control Date.

           (b)   Salary  and  Bonus.   Your base salary  and  annual  bonus
opportunity  may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

            (c)    Incentive  Compensation.   You  shall  be  eligible   to
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established  by
the  Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms  and
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent  with  the
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

           (d)   Benefits.   You  shall be eligible to participate  in  all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides  to its executive employees in accordance with the terms  of  such
plans  and  arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you,  in  the
aggregate,  than  the  terms and provisions available  to  other  executive
employees of the Company.

           (e)  Location.  You will continue to be employed at the business
location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control Date and
the  amount  of time that you are required to travel for business  purposes
will  not  be  increased  in any significant respect  from  the  amount  of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.

                                       25
<PAGE>

          3.   Involuntary Termination During the Term.

           (a)   Severance  Payment.   In the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the
date  of  such  Involuntary Termination the full amount of any  earned  but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at
the  time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated  on
the  basis of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you
may have accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay
you  within  5  days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion  of  the
annual  bonus  for  the year in which your Involuntary Termination  occurs,
calculated  on  the basis of your target bonus for that  year  and  on  the
assumption that all performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In
addition,  the  Company shall pay you in a cash lump  sum,  within  8  days
following the date of your execution of the release described in  the  last
sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of Termination, if later), an
amount  (the  "Severance Payment") equal to the sum of (i) two  times  your
Reference  Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.   The  Severance
Payment  shall  be in lieu of any other severance payments  which  you  are
entitled  to  receive  under any other severance pay  plan  or  arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance
Payment  shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor  of
the  Company  in  substantially the form of the release  required  for  the
receipt of severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the
date  of  this Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the  seven-day
revocation period specified therein.

            (b)   Benefit  Payment.   In  the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination  during  the  Term,  you and  your  eligible  dependents  shall
continue  to  be  eligible to participate during the  Benefit  Continuation
Period  (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health,  life  and
other  fringe benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you  immediately
prior  to your Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions  in
effect  for  you and your dependents immediately prior to such  Involuntary
Termination.   For purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation
Period" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on
the  earlier  to  occur  of  (i) the second  anniversary  of  the  Date  of
Termination and (ii) the date that you and your dependents are eligible and
elect  coverage  under  the plans of a subsequent  employer  which  provide
substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you and your dependents.

           (c)   Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination  of  your
employment  by the Company or by you during the Term shall be  communicated
by  a  notice  of  termination to the other party hereto  (the  "Notice  of
Termination").   The  Notice  of Termination shall  indicate  the  specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth  in
reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide  a  basis
for  termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.   The
date   of  your  termination  of  employment  with  the  Company  and   its
subsidiaries  (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined  as  follows:
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not have returned
to  the  full-time performance of your duties during such thirty  (30)  day
period),  (ii)  if  your employment is terminated  by  the  Company  in  an
Involuntary  Termination,  five (5) days  after  the  date  the  Notice  of
Termination  is received by you and (iii) if your employment is  terminated
by  the Company for Cause, the later of the date specified in the Notice of
Termination or ten (10) days following the date such notice is received  by
you.  If the basis for your Involuntary Termination is your resignation for
Good  Reason, the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date
your  Notice  of  Termination is received by the  Company.    The  Date  of
Termination  for  a resignation of employment other than  for  Good  Reason
shall  be  the date set forth in the applicable notice, which shall  be  no
earlier  than ten (10) days after the date such notice is received  by  the
Company.

           (d)   No  Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not  be  required  to
mitigate  the  amount  of any payment provided for  in  this  Agreement  by
seeking  other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment
or  benefit  provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any  compensation
earned by you as the result of employment by another employer or by pension
benefits  paid  by  the  Company or another  employer  after  the  Date  of
Termination or otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii)  of
the last sentence of Section 3(b).

          4.   Additional Payment.

           (a)   Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the
contrary,  if  it is determined that any Payment would be  subject  to  the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties
with  respect  to  such  excise tax (such excise  tax,  together  with  any
interest  or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise  Tax"),
then  you shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")
in  an  amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic  position
that  you  would  have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had  not  applied  to  the
Payment.   The  amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined  by  the
Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula
{(E  x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting  Firm
deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where
          E    equals  the  Payments  which are determined  to  be  "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
               280G(b)(1) of the Code;
     
                                       26
<PAGE>

          M    equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes
               applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

          T    equals  M  plus  the  rate of Excise Tax applicable  to  the
               Payment.

No  Gross-Up  Payments shall be payable hereunder if  the  Accounting  Firm
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

            (b)   Determination  of  Gross-Up  Payment.   Subject  to   the
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this  Section
4,  including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the  amount  of  the
Payments  constituting excess parachute payments, and  the  amount  of  the
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen
days  of the Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any  other
date  reasonably  requested by you or the Company on which a  determination
under  this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay  to
you  the  initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you  and
the Company of the Accounting Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm
determines  that no Excise Tax is payable by you, the Company  shall  cause
the Accounting Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm
has  substantial authority under the Code and Regulations not to report  an
Excise  Tax  on your federal income tax return.  Any determination  by  the
Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you and the Company.  If the  initial
Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount of the Excise Tax that
is  ultimately  determined to be owing by you with respect to  any  Payment
(hereinafter an "Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies
under  Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional Gross-Up
Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

           (c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim  by  the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would  require
the  payment  by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice  shall  be
given as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise
the  Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim  is
requested  to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration
of  the  thirty-day  period following the date  on  which  you  notify  the
Company,  or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in
writing  prior  to the expiration of the Notice Period that it  desires  to
contest  the  claim,  you  shall:  (i) give  the  Company  any  information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii)  take  such
action  in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with  respect
to  such  claim  by  an attorney reasonably selected  by  the  Company  and
reasonably  acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with  the  Company  in  good
faith  in  contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate
in  any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings,  and  conferences with the taxing authority in  respect  of  such
claim.   If  requested  by the Company, you agree either  to  pay  the  tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner
and  to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal,  in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more  appellate
courts  as  the Company shall determine; provided, however,  that,  if  the
Company  directs  you  to pay such claim and pursue a refund,  the  Company
shall  advance  the  amount of such payment to  you  on  an  after-tax  and
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the  contest
related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
any  other  issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or  other  taxing
authority.  If the Company does not notify you in writing prior to the  end
of  the Notice Period of its desire to contest the claim, the Company shall
pay  to  you  an  additional  Gross-Up Payment in  respect  of  the  excess
parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and you agree to  pay
the  amount  of  the Excise Tax that is the subject of  the  claim  to  the
applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an  Advance,  you
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together  with
any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after  receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall
not  be  entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and  the  Company
does not promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid  by  you
and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up
Payment then owing to you.

           (e)   Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify  you  and
hold  you  harmless,  on  an  after-tax basis, from  any  costs,  expenses,
penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by  you
with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this
Section  4,  including,  without limitation,  any  Losses  related  to  the
Company's  decision  to  contest a claim  or  any  imputed  income  to  you
resulting  from any Advance or action taken on your behalf by  the  Company
hereunder.   The  Company shall pay all legal fees  and  expenses  incurred
under  this  Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  you in connection with any  actions  taken  by  the
Company  or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The Company shall  also
pay all of

                                       27

the   fees  and  expenses  of  the  Accounting  Firm,  including,   without
limitation,  the fees and expenses related to the opinion  referred  to  in
Section 4(b).

           (f)   Combined  Payments.   Anything in this Section  4  to  the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a
required  Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount  of
all  Combined  Payments has at the time such payment is  due  exceeded  the
Limit.   If  the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this  Section  4
would  result  in  the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit,  the  Company
shall  pay you only the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which  can
be  paid  to  you  without  causing the aggregate amount  of  all  Combined
Payments to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled to a Gross-
Up  Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or former employees of
the  Company are also entitled to gross-up payments under the corresponding
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangements and the aggregate amount
of  all  such  payments would cause the Limit on Combined  Payments  to  be
exceeded,  the Company shall allocate the amount of the reduction necessary
to comply with the Limit among all such payments in the proportion that the
amount  of each such gross-up payment bears to the aggregate amount of  all
such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) shall require you to repay  to
the  Company any amount that was previously paid to you under this  Section
4.

          5.   Other Provisions.

           (a)   Vesting  and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted  to  you
under  the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become
exercisable  in the event of your Involuntary Termination on  or  following
the Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date
of  the  Equity  Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will  vest  and
become exercisable as of such date.

           (b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the terms
of  the  Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that
the   Administrator  elects  not  to  cash  out  such  Equity  Awards,  the
Administrator has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of  all
or  substantially all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such
Equity  Awards to be assumed or an equivalent option or stock  appreciation
right  granted by the successor corporation to the Company or a  parent  or
subsidiary  of  such successor corporation, or (ii) to  provide  that  your
Equity Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning  on
the  date that you are so notified of such action by the Administrator  and
that such Equity Awards will expire to the extent not exercised at the  end
of such thirty-day period (the "30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator
determines  to  utilize the 30-Day Alternative, the Company shall  pay  you
with  respect to each such Equity Award the excess, if any (the "Additional
Amount"),  of the Change in Control Price you would have received  had  the
Equity  Award  been  cashed out on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control  over the value of the consideration actually received  by  you  in
settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such consideration  is
received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary Termination on
or  after  the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the  date  of  the
Equity  Plan  Change in Control, the Company shall pay you  the  Additional
Amount  as if your employment had continued through the date of the  Equity
Plan  Change  in  Control.  In either case, the payment of  the  Additional
Amount  shall  be  made  within 5 days following the determination  by  the
Administrator of the Change in Control Price.

           (c)   Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the  transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time  or  is
structured  in  such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely  that  you
would  be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing  profits
under  Section  16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability")  if
you  were to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through
a  merger)  of  your  Short-Term Awards as  part  of,  or  prior  to,  such
transaction and (ii) your inability to exercise, tender, sell or  otherwise
dispose  of  your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the date of such  Equity
Plan  Change in Control eliminates or reduces the value of some or  all  of
your  Short-Term  Awards, then, on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control,  the  Company  shall pay you in a cash  lump  sum  the  amount  of
"amount".  The provisions of clause (ii) of the previous sentence shall  be
deemed  to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising, tendering  or
otherwise  disposing  of  your  Short-Term  Awards  on  or  prior  to   the
Transaction  Date  in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit  Liability,  (b)  a
Short-Term  Award  cannot be repurchased, exchanged or  cashed-out  by  the
Company  (or  other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date  without  a
risk  of  Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are  required  to
delay  the  exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term
Awards  in  order  to  avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  such  delay
results  in your receiving consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued
at  the date such consideration is received) which is of lesser value  than
the  consideration you would have received (valued as of the  date  of  the
Equity Plan Change in Control) for such awards had such delay not occurred.
The  foregoing provisions shall apply to your Equity Awards notwithstanding
your Involuntary Termination of employment with the Company on or after the
Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control.  The
provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if (A) prior to the  Equity
Plan  Change  in Control, the Company provides you at its expense  with  an
opinion  from  a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating  that  the
exercise,  tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term  Awards  as
part  of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan  Change
in  Control  will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  (B)
following your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you  to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or
prior  to  the  Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing  the  value
thereof.

                                       28

           (d)     General.   Anything in this Agreement  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding,   in  no  event  shall  the  vesting  and   exercisability
provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be  less
favorable to you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect  on
the date hereof.

          6.   Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you  on  an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including,  without
limitation,  court  costs  and reasonable legal  fees  and  expenses  which
reflect  common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred  by
you  as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your
termination  of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting,  disputing  or
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or  (iii)
arising  out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability
of  this  Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however,  that  the
amount  of  the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall  not
exceed $2 million.

          7.   Successors; Binding Agreement.

           (a)   Assumption  by  Successor. The Company  will  require  any
successor  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,  consolidation
or  otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement  in  the
same  manner  and to the same extent that the Company would be required  to
perform  it if no such succession had taken place; provided, however,  that
no  such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.
As  used  in  this  Agreement, the "Company"  shall  mean  the  Company  as
hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business  and/or  assets  as
aforesaid  which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by  operation
of law or otherwise.

           (b)   Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This  Agreement  shall  be
binding   upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  you  (and  your  personal
representatives  and  heirs)  and the Company and  any  organization  which
succeeds  to  substantially all of the business or assets of  the  Company,
whether  by  means  of  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of   all   or
substantially  all  of  the assets of the Company or otherwise,  including,
without  limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by operation  of
law.   This  Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by
your   personal   or  legal  representatives,  executors,   administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you should  die
while  any  amount  would  still be payable to you  hereunder  if  you  had
continued  to  live,  all such amounts, unless otherwise  provided  herein,
shall  be  paid  in  accordance with the terms of this  Agreement  to  your
devisee,  legatee  or other designee or, if there is no such  designee,  to
your estate.

           8.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

           "Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such  firm  is
unable  or  unwilling  to perform such calculations,  such  other  national
accounting  firm as shall be designated by agreement between  you  and  the
Company.   To  the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting  firm
shall  be designated to perform the calculations in respect of the Combined
Arrangements.

           "Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in the
applicable  Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity  Plan,
the Board.

           "Cause"  shall mean a termination of your employment during  the
Term  which  is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii)  your  willful
disclosure  of  material  trade  secrets  or  other  material  confidential
information related to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries  or
(iii)  your  willful and continued failure substantially  to  perform  your
duties  with the Company (other than any such failure resulting  from  your
incapacity  due  to  physical  or mental illness  or  any  such  actual  or
anticipated  failure resulting from a resignation by you for  Good  Reason)
after  a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you  by
the  Board,  which demand specifically identifies the manner in  which  the
Board  believes that you have not substantially performed your duties,  and
which  performance is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days  of
receipt of such demand.   For purposes of the previous sentence, no act  or
failure  to  act  on your part shall be deemed "willful"  unless  done,  or
omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable  belief
that  your  action  or omission was in the best interest  of  the  Company.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, you shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  been
terminated  for Cause unless and until there shall have been  delivered  to
you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
than  three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of  the  Board  at  a
meeting  of  the  Board called and held for such purpose (after  reasonable
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be
heard  before  the Board), finding that in the good faith  opinion  of  the
Board  you  were guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i),  (ii)  or
(iii)  of the first sentence of this section and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.

            "Change  in  Control" shall mean a change  in  control  of  the
Company  of  a nature that would be required to be reported in response  to
Item  6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange
Act,  whether  or  not  the  Company is  then  subject  to  such  reporting
requirement;  provided, however, that, anything in this  Agreement  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, a Change in Control  shall  be  deemed  to  have
occurred if:

                                       29
<PAGE>
     
          (i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust,  unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or  any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Exchange Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3  of  the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange  Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing  30%
     or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
     securities  entitled  to  vote in the election  of  directors  of  the
     Company;
     
           (ii)  during  any  period  of  two (2)  consecutive  years  (not
     including  any  period  prior  to the  execution  of  this  Agreement)
     individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the  Board
     and  any new directors, whose election by the Board or nomination  for
     election  by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote  of  at
     least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then still in office who
     either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election
     or  nomination for election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent
     Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof;
     
          (iii)     There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
     other  corporate  transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),
     in  each  case, with respect to which the stockholders of the  Company
     immediately  prior to such Transaction do not, immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power  of
     the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
     
           (iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company  are
     sold, liquidated or distributed; or
     
           (v)   there  is a "change in control" of the Company within  the
     meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the Regulations.
     
           "Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the date
on  which the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date on which the  Company
executes  an  agreement,  the consummation of which  would  result  in  the
occurrence  of  a  Change in Control, (iii) the date the Board  approves  a
transaction  or  series of transactions, the consummation  of  which  would
result  in  a  Change  in Control and (iv) the date the  Company  fails  to
satisfy its obligations to have this agreement assumed by any successor  to
the  Company  in  accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.   If  the
Change  in  Control  Date occurs as a result of an agreement  described  in
clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of  the
Board described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the Change  in
Control  to  which  such agreement or approval relates  (the  "Contemplated
Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then the Term shall expire
on  the  sixtieth  day  (the "Reset Date") following  the  date  the  Board
certifies  by  resolution  duly adopted by three-fourths  (3/4ths)  of  the
Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in  Control
is  not  reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this  sentence
shall  not apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment  with
the Company has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on  or
prior  to  the  Reset  Date  or  (B)  the Contemplated  Change  in  Control
subsequently  occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following  the
Reset  Date, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and  a
new  Term  shall  commence upon the occurrence of a  subsequent  Change  in
Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, if  your
employment with the Company terminates prior to the Change in Control  Date
and  it is reasonably demonstrated that your termination of employment  (i)
was  at  the  request  of  the third party who has taken  steps  reasonably
calculated  to  effect  the Change in Control or (ii)  otherwise  arose  in
connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, then Change in
Control  Date  shall mean the date immediately prior to the  date  of  your
termination of employment.

           "Change  in  Control Price" shall mean the  "Change  in  Control
Price"  as  defined  in the applicable Equity Plan and  determined  by  the

Equity Plan to determine such price as of such date.

Agreements  entered into as of the date first set forth above  between  the
Company  and  certain  of its executive officers, any  Retention  Agreement
entered into after the date hereof which is specifically designated by  the

Severance Plan.

           "Combined Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash amount of  (i)
severance payments made to you under Section 3(a) of this Agreement  or  to
any other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of
the  applicable  Combined Arrangement, (ii) severance payments  made  under
Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of

under  Section  6  of  this Agreement or to any other  employee  or  former
employee  under  the  corresponding provisions of the  applicable  Combined
Arrangement,  (iv)  fees and expenses which are paid or reimbursed  to  you
under  Section  6  of  this Agreement or to any other  employee  or  former
employee  under  the  corresponding provisions of the  applicable  Combined

to any other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions
of  the  applicable  Combined Arrangement and (vi) costs  incurred  by  the
Company in respect of any employee or former employee under Section 2(d) of
the  Supplement or the corresponding provisions of the applicable  Combined

           "Disability" shall mean (i) your incapacity due to  physical  or

your  failure  to return to full-time performance of your  duties  for  the
Company within thirty (30) days after written Notice of Termination due  to
Disability  is  given  to you.  Any question as to the  existence  of  your
Disability  upon which you and the Company cannot agree shall be determined
by a qualified independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable
to make such selection, such selection shall be made by any adult member of
your immediate family), and approved by the Company.  The determination  of
such physician made in writing to the Company and to you shall be final and
conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.

          "Equity Awards" shall mean options, restricted stock, bonus stock

     immediately prior to the Change in Control Date;
     
           (ii) A reduction by the Company in your annual base salary as in
     effect immediately prior to the Change in Control Date or as the  same

     compensation  plan in which you participated prior to  the  Change  in
     Control  Date  or  made available to you after the Change  in  Control

     substitute  or  alternative plan) has been made with respect  to  such
     plan  in connection with the Change in Control, or the failure by  the
     Company  to  continue  your  participation  therein  on  at  least  as
     favorable  a  basis, both in terms of the amount of benefits  provided
     and the level of your participation relative to other participants, as

EXHIBIT 10.A.22

June 9, 1995
Mr. Michael H. Spindler
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, California 95014

Retention Agreement


Dear Mr. Spindler:

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation  
(the "Company"), considers it essential to the best interests of its 
stockholders to take reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  
Further, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that
the uncertainty and questions which might arise among management in the 
context of a change in control of the Company could result in the departure 
or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its
stockholders.

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps 
should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in 
control of the Company.

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company,
the Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement 
(this "Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment 
in the event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which
are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such 
words in Section 8 of this Agreement.

		1.	Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of 
your employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control
Date and shall continue until the third anniversary of the Change in Control 
Date (the "Term").
		2.	Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the 
following terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the 
Company:

		(a)	Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles,
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no
less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the 
Change in Control Date.

		(b)	Salary and Bonus.  Your base salary and annual bonus 
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically 
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to 
other senior executives of the Company.

		(c)	Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

		(d)	Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in 
all pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the 
Company provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of 
such plans and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, 
in the aggregate, than the terms and provisions available to other executive 
employees of the Company.
		
                (e)	Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control 
Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel for business 
purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the amount 
of business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date. 


                                  35
<PAGE>

		3.	Involuntary Termination During the Term.  

		(a)	Severance Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the 
date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but unpaid
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time
of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis 
of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have 
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you 
within 5 days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual 
bonus for the year in which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated 
on the basis of your target bonus for that year and on the assumption that 
all performance targets have been or will be achieved.  In addition, the 
Company shall pay you in a cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date 
of your execution of the release described in the last sentence of this 
Section 3(a) (or the Date of Termination, if later), an amount (the 
"Severance Payment") equal to three times the sum of your Reference Salary 
and your Reference Bonus.  The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any 
other severance payments which you are entitled to receive under any other 
severance pay plan or arrangement sponsored by the Company and its 
subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance Payment shall be conditioned 
upon your execution of a release in favor of the Company in substantially 
the form of the release required for the receipt of severance payments
under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) which 
is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period specified 
therein.

		(b)	Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible 
dependents shall continue to be eligible to participate during the Benefit 
Continuation Period (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, 
dental, health, life and other fringe benefit plans and arrangements 
applicable to you immediately prior to your Involuntary 
Termination on the same terms and conditions in effect for you and your 
dependents immediately prior to such Involuntary 
Termination.  For purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation 
Period" means the period beginning on the Date of 
Termination and ending on the earlier to occur of (i) the third anniversary 
of the Date of Termination and (ii) the date that you and 
your dependents are eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a 
subsequent employer which provide substantially equivalent or 
greater benefits to you and your dependents.
	
		(c)	Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination of 
your employment by the Company or by you during 
the Term shall be communicated by a notice of termination to the other 
party hereto (the "Notice of Termination").  The Notice of 
Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in this 
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the 
facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your 
employment under the provision so indicated.  The date of 
your termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (the 
"Date of Termination") shall be determined as follows:  (i) 
if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after a 
Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not 
have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such thirty 
(30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by 
the Company in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the 
Notice of Termination is received by you and (iii) if your 
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, the later of the date 
specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10) days 
following the date such notice is received by you.  If the basis for your 
Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, 
the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your Notice 
of Termination is received by the Company.   The Date of 
Termination for a resignation of employment other than for Good Reason 
shall be the date set forth in the applicable notice, which 
shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date such notice is 
received by the Company.		
		
		(d)	No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required 
to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in 
this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the 
amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this 
Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of 
employment by another employer or by pension benefits 
paid by the Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or 
otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii) of 
the last sentence of Section 3(b).

		4.	Additional Payment.  

		(a)	Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, if it is determined that any Payment 
would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or 
any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax 
(such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is 
herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be entitled to 
an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will place 
you in the same after-tax economic position that you 
would have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The 
amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined by 
the Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula
{(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting Firm 
deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same 
result), where
	E	equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess parachute 
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code;



                                 36
<PAGE>

	M	equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes 
applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and


        T	equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the 
Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm 
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

 		(b)	Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the 
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required 
under this Section 4, including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the 
amount of the Payments constituting excess parachute 
payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the 
Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting 
calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen days of the Change 
in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other 
date reasonably requested by you or the Company on which a determination 
under this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  The 
Company shall pay to you the initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the 
receipt by you and the Company of the Accounting 
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax 
is payable by you, the Company shall cause the 
Accounting Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm has 
substantial authority under the Code and Regulations 
not to report an Excise Tax on your federal income tax return.  Any 
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you 
and the Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover 
the amount of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined 
to be owing by you with respect to any Payment (hereinafter an 
"Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies under 
Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional Gross-Up 
Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

		(c)	Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in 
writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if 
successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  
Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable 
after you know of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of 
the claim and the date on which the claim is requested to 
be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the 
thirty-day period following the date on which you notify the 
Company, or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with respect 
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the 
Company notifies you in writing prior to the expiration of the Notice 
Period that it desires to contest the claim, you shall:  (i) give the 
Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to the 
claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the 
claim as the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, 
accepting legal representation with respect to such claim 
by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable 
to you; (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith 
in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any 
proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the 
Company to control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, 
permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all 
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the 
taxing authority in respect of such claim.  If requested by the 
Company, you agree either to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or 
contest the claim in any permissible manner and to prosecute 
such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a 
court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts 
as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company 
directs you to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the 
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and 
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's 
control of the contest related to the claim shall be limited to the issues 
related to the Gross-Up Payment and you shall be entitled to 
settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issues raised by the 
Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If the Company 
does not notify you in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period of its 
desire to contest the claim, the Company shall pay to you an 
additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments 
that are the subject of the claim, and you agree to pay the 
amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the claim to the applicable 
taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

		(d)	Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an Advance, 
you become entitled to a refund with respect to the 
claim to which such Advance relates, you shall pay the Company the amount 
of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited 
thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by you of an 
Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be entitled to 
any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not promptly 
notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then 
the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you and the 
amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional 
Gross-Up Payment then owing to you.  

		(e)	Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify 
you and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from 
any costs, expenses, penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities 
("Losses") incurred by you with respect to the exercise by the 
Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, including, without 
limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to 

                               37

federal, state and local marginal rate of 56% would be

<PAGE>

contest a claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 
action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  
The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred under this 
Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable 
expenses incurred by you in connection with any actions taken by the 
Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The 
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, 
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses 
related to the opinion referred to in Section 4(b).

		(f)	Combined Payments.  Anything in this Section 4 to 
the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have 
no obligation to pay you a required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 
if the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments has at 
the time such payment is due exceeded the Limit.  If the amount of a Gross-Up
Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in 
the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you only 
the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can 
be paid to you without causing the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments
to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled 
to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or former 
employees of the Company are also entitled to gross-up 
payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined 
Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such 
payments would cause the Limit on Combined Payments to be exceeded, the 
Company shall allocate the amount of the reduction 
necessary to comply with the Limit among all such payments in the proportion
that the amount of each such gross-up payment bears to 
the aggregate amount of all such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) 
shall require you to repay to the Company any amount that 
was previously paid to you under this Section 4.

		5.	Other Provisions.  

		(a)	Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted to 
you under the Equity Plans (including Short-Term 
Awards) shall vest and become exercisable in the event of your Involuntary 
Termination on or following the Change in Control Date. 
If you are employed by the Company on the date of the Equity Plan Change in 
Control, your Equity Awards will vest and become 
exercisable as of such date.

		(b)	Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with 
the terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan 
Change in Control, Equity Awards which are options or stock appreciation 
rights are "cashed out," unless the Administrator in its 
discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that the Administrator 
elects not to cash out such Equity Awards, the Administrator 
has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such 
Equity Awards to be assumed or an equivalent option or stock appreciation 
right granted by the successor corporation to the Company 
or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, or (ii) to provide 
that your Equity Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-
day period beginning on the date that you are so notified of such action by 
the Administrator and that such Equity Awards will expire 
to the extent not exercised at the end of such thirty-day period (the 
"30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator determines to utilize 
the 30-Day Alternative, the Company shall pay you with respect to each such 
Equity Award the excess, if any (the "Additional 
Amount"), of the Change in Control Price you would have received had the 
Equity Award been cashed out on the date of the Equity 
Plan Change in Control over the value of the consideration actually 
received by you in settlement of such awards (determined as of the 
date such consideration is received by you).  Further, in the event of your 
Involuntary Termination on or after the Change in Control 
Date but on or prior to the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the 
Company shall pay you the Additional Amount as if your 
employment had continued through the date of the Equity Plan Change in 
Control.  In either case, the payment of the Additional 
Amount shall be made within 5 days following the determination by the 
Administrator of the Change in Control Price.

		(c)	Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the 
transaction resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control 
occurs at such a time or is structured in such a manner so as to make it 
reasonably likely that you would be subject to actual or 
potential liability for short-swing profits under Section 16 of the 
Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability") if you were to 
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through a merger) of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, such 
transaction and (ii) your inability to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise 
dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the date of 
such Equity Plan Change in Control eliminates or reduces the value of some 
or all of your Short-Term Awards, then, on the date of the 
Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you in a cash lump sum 
the amount of $0.  The provisions of clause (ii) of the 
previous sentence shall be deemed to apply where (a) you are precluded from 
exercising, tendering or otherwise disposing of your 
Short-Term Awards on or prior to the Transaction Date in order to avoid 
Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b) a Short-Term Award cannot 
be repurchased, exchanged or cashed-out by the Company (or other person) on 
or prior to the Transaction Date without a risk of Short-
Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are required to delay the 
exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term 
Awards in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability and such delay 
results in your receiving consideration for your Short-Term 
Awards (valued at the date such consideration is received) which is of 
lesser value than the consideration you would have received 
(valued as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control) for such 
awards had such delay not occurred.  The foregoing provisions 
shall apply to your Equity Awards notwithstanding your Involuntary 
Termination of employment with the Company on or after the 
Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control.  
The provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if (A) prior 
to the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company provides you at its 
expense with an opinion from a nationally recognized firm of 
attorneys stating that the exercise, tender, sale or other disposition of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, the transaction 
resulting in the Equity Plan Change in Control will not subject you to 
Short-Swing Profit Liability and (B) following your receipt of 

       				38
<PAGE>

such opinion there is sufficient time for you to exercise, tender, sell or 
otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing the value thereof.   

		(d)	General.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
 notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and 
exercisability provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity 
Awards be less favorable to you then the terms and 
provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof. 			

		6.	Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or 
reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and 
expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal 
fees and expenses which reflect common practice with 
respect to the matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any claim, 
action or proceeding (i) arising out of your termination of 
employment during the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or enforcing any 
right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) 
arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability 
of this Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however, 
that the amount of the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 
shall not exceed $2 million.

		7.	Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a) 	Assumption by Successor. The Company will require 
any successor (whether direct or indirect, by 
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all 
of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume 
and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same 
extent that the Company would be required to perform it 
if no such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such 
assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations 
hereunder.  As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company 
as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its 
business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform 
this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

		(b)	Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement 
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and 
your personal representatives and heirs) and the Company and any 
organization which succeeds to substantially all of the business or 
assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, consolidation, 
acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company 
or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in 
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to 
the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, 
executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, 
devisees and legatees.  If you should die while any amount would still be 
payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all 
such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance 
with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee 
or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.

		8.	Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the 
following capitalized words shall have the meanings set 
forth below:

		"Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such firm 
is unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, 
such other national accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement 
between you and the Company.  To the extent reasonably 
practicable, one such accounting firm shall be designated to perform the 
calculations in respect of the Combined Arrangements.

		"Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined 
in the applicable Equity Plan or, if no such term is 
defined in the Equity Plan, the Board.

		"Cause" shall mean a termination of your employment during 
the Term which is a result of (i) your felony 
conviction, (ii) your willful disclosure of material trade secrets or other 
material confidential information related to the business of the 
Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your willful and continued failure 
substantially to perform your duties with the Company (other 
than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or 
mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting 
from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a written demand for 
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, 
which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes 
that you have not substantially performed your duties, 
and which performance is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days 
of receipt of such demand.   For purposes of the previous 
sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall be deemed "willful" 
unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith 
and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best 
interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
you shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until 
there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a 
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than 
three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a 
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable 
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your 
counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith 
opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct set forth above 
in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this section and 
specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		 "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be 
reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A 
promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or not the 
Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided, however, 
that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 

				39
<PAGE>

notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

	(i)	any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, 
trust, unincorporated organization or other entity 
or person, or any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 
14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, is or becomes the 
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and 
Regulations under the Exchange Act), directly or 
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then 
outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the 
Company;

	(ii)	during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not 
including any period prior to the execution of this 
Agreement) individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the 
Board and any new directors, whose election by 
the Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was 
approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) 
of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the 
beginning of the period or whose election or nomination 
for election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent Directors"), cease 
for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; 

	(iii)	There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or 
other corporate transaction involving the Company 
(a "Transaction"), in each case, with respect to which the stockholders of 
the Company immediately prior to such Transaction 
do not, immediately after the Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the 
combined voting power of the Company or other 
corporation resulting from such Transaction;

	(iv)	all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are

meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the 
Regulations.

		"Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the 
date on which the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date 
on which the Company executes an agreement, the consummation of which would 
result in the occurrence of a Change in Control, (iii) 
the date the Board approves a transaction or series of transactions, the 
consummation of which would result in a Change in Control 
and (iv) the date the Company fails to satisfy its obligations to have this 
agreement assumed by any successor to the Company in 
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change in Control 
Date occurs as a result of an agreement described in clause 
(ii) of the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of the Board 
described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the 
Change in Control to which such agreement or approval relates (the 
"Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, 
then the Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date") following 
the date the Board certifies by resolution duly adopted by 
three-fourths (3/4ths) of the Incumbent Directors then in office that the 
Contemplated Change in Control is not reasonably likely to 
occur; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply if (A) an 
Involuntary Termination of your employment with the Company 
has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on or prior to the 
Reset Date or (B) the Contemplated Change in Control 
subsequently occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following the 
Reset Date, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain 
in effect and a new Term shall commence upon the occurrence of a subsequent 

Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first 
sentence of this section, if your employment with the Company terminates 
prior to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably 
demonstrated that your termination of employment (i) was at the request of 
the third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated 
to effect the Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with 
or in anticipation of the Change in Control, then Change in 
Control Date shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of your 
termination of employment.

		"Change in Control Price" shall mean the "Change in Control 
Price" as defined in the applicable Equity Plan and

such date.

		"Combined Arrangements" shall mean this Agreement, the 
Retention Agreements entered into as of the date first set 
forth above between the Company and certain of its executive officers, any 
Retention Agreement entered into after the date hereof 
which is specifically designated by the terms thereof as one of the 
Combined Arrangements and the Supplement to the Severance Plan.

		"Combined Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash amount of 
(i) severance payments made to you under Section 
3(a) of this Agreement or to any other employee or former employee under 
the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined 
Arrangement, (ii) severance payments made under Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of 
the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-Up Payments made to you under 
Section 6 of this Agreement or to any other employee 
or former employee under the corresponding provisions of the applicable 
Combined Arrangement, (iv) fees and expenses which are 
paid or reimbursed to you under Section 6 of this Agreement or to any other 
employee or former employee under the corresponding 
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangement, (v) payments made to you 
under Section 5 of this Agreement or to any other 
employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of the

written Notice of Termination due to Disability is given to 
you.  Any question as to the existence of your Disability upon which you 
and the Company cannot agree shall be determined by a 
qualified independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable to 
make such selection, such selection shall be made by any

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results have been included.  All adjustments are  of  a  normal
   recurring nature unless specified in a separate note included  in  these
   Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The results  for  interim
   periods  are  not necessarily indicative of results to be  expected  for
   the  entire year.  These financial statements and notes should  be  read
   in   conjunction  with  the  Company's  annual  consolidated   financial
   statements  and  the notes thereto for the fiscal year  ended  September
   30,  1994, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   September 30, 1994 (the "1994 Form 10-K").

2. The   Company  lowered  its  estimates  of  the  total  remaining  costs
   associated  with its restructuring plan initiated in the  third  quarter
   of  1993  and recorded adjustments that increased income by $17  million
   ($11  million,  or  $0.09 per share, after taxes)  and  $6  million  ($4
   million,  or  $0.  03  per share, after taxes) in the  first  and  third
   quarters  of 1995, respectively.  These adjustments primarily  reflected
   favorable  cancellation settlements of certain R&D  project  commitments
   and  facility leases and the completion of other actions at lower  costs
   than originally estimated.

   At  June  30, 1995, the Company had $15 million of accrued restructuring
   costs  for  actions  that  are currently under  way.   Approximately  $6
   million  in  charges to the accrual are expected to be  incurred  during
   1995 with the remaining $9 million incurred beyond 1995.  Charges to  be
   incurred  beyond  1995  relate  primarily to  recurring  payments  under
   certain noncancelable operating leases.

3. Interest and other income (expense), net, consists of the following:

4. Effective  October  1,  1994, the Company adopted  Financial  Accounting
   Standard No. 115 (FAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in  Debt
   and  Equity  Securities".   In accordance with  FAS  115,  prior  period
   financial  statements have not been restated to reflect  the  change  in
   accounting  principle.   The cumulative effect of  the  change  was  not
   material to shareholders' equity as of October 1, 1994.  Under FAS  115,
   debt  securities that a company has both the positive intent and ability
   to  hold  to  maturity are carried at amortized cost.   Debt  securities
   that a company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold  to
   maturity  and all marketable equity securities are classified as  either
   available-for-sale   or  trading  and  are  carried   at   fair   value.
   Generally,  unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified
   as  available-for-sale  are  reported as a  component  of  shareholders'
   equity.   Unrealized  holding gains and losses on securities  classified
   as trading are included in earnings.

   The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily of  certificates  of
   deposit,  time  deposits and commercial paper with maturities  of  three
   months  or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term investments consist
   principally  of  commercial  paper with  maturities  between  three  and
   twelve  months.  The Company's marketable equity securities  consist  of
   securities  issued  by  U.S. corporations and  are  included  in  "Other
   assets"  on the accompanying balance sheet.  As of June 30,  1995,   the
   Company's   cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  marketable
   equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.

   The  adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding
   gains  (losses)  on available-for-sale cash equivalents  and  short-term
   investments  were not material either individually or in the  aggregate,
   at  June 30, 1995.  The net adjustment recorded to shareholders'  equity
   for  unrealized  holding  gains (losses) related  to  marketable  equity
   securities was an unrealized gain of approximately $39 million  at  June
   30, 1995.  The realized gains (losses) recorded to earnings on sales  of
   available-for-sale securities, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   were not material for the three and nine months ended June 30, 1995.

   5. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $391
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested   in  operations  outside  the  United  States.   It   is   not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely  invested earnings, the Company provides  for  federal  and
   state  income  taxes  currently  on undistributed  earnings  of  foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) has proposed  federal  income  tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company  has  made
   certain   prepayments  thereon.   The  Company  contested  the  proposed
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues  in
   dispute for these years  have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the  IRS
   issued  a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of  the
   Company's  federal  income taxes for the years 1989 through  1991.   The
   Company intends to file a petition with the United States Tax Court   to
   contest  these  alleged  tax  deficiencies.   Management  believes  that
   adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments  that  may  result
   from these tax examinations.

6. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options outstanding during the period.

7. Certain  prior year amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  and  the
   consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to  conform
   to the current period presentation.

8. On  July  18,  1995, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend  of
   $0.12  per share for the Company's third fiscal quarter ended  June  30,
   1995.  The dividend is payable on September 8, 1995, to shareholders  of
   record as of August 18, 1995.

9. The  information  set  forth  in Item 1 of  Part  II  hereof  is  hereby
   incorporated by reference.

Net  sales  for  the third quarter and first nine months of 1995  increased
over the comparable periods of 1994, primarily resulting from a combination
of  unit  growth,  higher average selling prices and  changes  in  currency
exchange  rates.  The increase in average selling prices was  driven  by  a
shift  in mix towards the Company's newer products and products with multi-
media  configurations.  Specifically, the Company recorded strong sales  of
products  within  its Performa(registered trademark) family and the Power 
Macintosh(Trademark)  family  ofpersonal  computers.  Increased sales of 
these products contributed  to  an increase in the average aggregate revenue 
per Macintosh(registered trademark) computer  unit  of
approximately  8%  and 14% in the third quarter and first  nine  months  of
1995,  respectively, over the comparable periods of 1994.  Total  Macintosh
computer  unit sales increased 20% and 12% in the third quarter  and  first
nine  months  of 1995, respectively, over the comparable periods  of  1994.
This  unit  sales  growth principally resulted from  strong  sales  of  the
Company's Power Macintosh products which account for over 50% of total unit
shipments at the end of the third quarter of 1995, compared with 27% in the
comparable  period  of  1994, and from newer product offerings  within  the
Performa  family  of  desktop personal computers.   This  unit  growth  was
partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the Company's  older
product offerings.

International  net  sales grew 24% and 26% in the third quarter  and  first
nine  months  of 1995, respectively, over the comparable periods  of  1994,
primarily  reflecting  strong  net sales  growth  in  the  Pacific  region,
particularly Japan, and favorable changes in currency exchange rates.   Net
sales  for  the third quarter and first nine months of 1995 grew moderately
in  Europe  over the comparable periods of 1994.  International  net  sales
represented 49% and 50% of total net sales for the third quarter and  first
nine months of 1995, respectively, compared with 47% and 48%, respectively,
for the corresponding periods of 1994.  Domestic net sales grew 16% in both
the  third  quarter and first nine months of 1995, respectively,  over  the
comparable periods of 1994, primarily resulting from strong growth  in  the
education and business markets.

In  general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an  as-
needed  basis.   Resellers frequently change delivery schedules  and  order
rates depending on changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ("backlog")
can  be,  and  often are, canceled at will.  The Company attempts  to  fill
orders  on the requested delivery schedules.  However, products may  be  in
relatively  short  supply from time to time until production  volumes  have
reached  a  level  sufficient to meet demand  or  if  other  production  or
fulfillment   constraints  exist.   The  Company's  backlog  increased   to
approximately  $1,047  million at August 4, 1995, from  approximately  $795
million  at  May  5, 1995, primarily due to backlog of the Company's  Power
Macintosh products.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time  is  not a meaningful indication of  its  future  business
prospects.   In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  of  or
immediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering
by  dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply  once
dealers and customers believe they

                                        8

can  obtain sufficient supply.  Because of the foregoing, as well as  other
factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a
reliable   indicator   of  the  Company's  future  revenue   or   financial
performance.   Further information regarding the Company's backlog  may  be
found  under  Part  I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q under the heading  "Factors
that  May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition", which information
is hereby incorporated by reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and
its  cost  of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the  sale  of
products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for  its
products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based
primarily  on  the cost of components and to a lesser extent, direct  labor
costs.    The   type  and  cost  of  components  included   in   particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and  disk  drives)
are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations
competitive with other manufacturers.  Competition in the personal computer
industry is intense, and in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and
product  configuration are often necessary in order to remain  competitive.
Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly
influenced  in  the  short term by actions undertaken  by  the  Company  in
response to industry-wide competitive pressures.

Gross  margin  increased both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during the third quarter and first nine months of 1995, respectively,  over
the  comparable  periods  of  1994.  The increase  in  gross  margin  as  a
percentage  of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in  product  mix
towards  the  Company's  newer, high margin products  within  each  product
category  which  included  strong  sales of  certain  products  within  the
Company's entry-level Macintosh Performa family and of products within  its
Power Macintosh family of personal computers.

The  increase in gross margin levels was affected favorably by  changes  in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates as a result  of  a  weaker  U.S.  dollar
relative  to certain foreign currencies during the first, second and  third
quarters  of  1995 compared with the corresponding periods  of  1994.   The
Company's  operating  strategy and pricing take  into  account  changes  in
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations  can
be  significantly  affected in the short term by  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency exchange rates.

The  Company's  gross margin percentage improved from 26.2% in  the  second
quarter  of 1995 to 28.3% in the third quarter of 1995, resulting primarily
from  the introduction and sale of new products within the entry level  and
desktop product categories, including new Power Macintosh products, as well
as  from the impact of changes in currency exchange rates.  However, it  is
anticipated  that gross margins will remain under pressure and  could  fall
below  prior years' levels worldwide due to a variety of factors, including
continued  industry-wide  pricing  pressures,  increased  competition,  and
compressed product life cycles.

Research  and  development expenditures increased in amount  in  the  third
quarter  and first nine months of 1995 when compared with the corresponding
periods  of 1994, due to higher project- and headcount-related spending  as
the  Company  continues to invest in the development of  new  products  and
technologies.

As  a  percentage  of  net  sales, research  and  development  expenditures
remained  relatively consistent in the third quarter of 1995 when  compared
with   the   corresponding  period  of  1994.   Research  and   development
expenditures in the first nine months of 1995 decreased as a percentage  of
net  sales  when compared with the corresponding period of 1994,  primarily
due to the increase in the level of net sales.

The  Company  anticipates that research and development  expenditures  will
decrease as a percentage of net sales during the remaining quarter of 1995.

Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased in  amount  in  the
third  quarter  and  first  nine months of  1995  when  compared  with  the
corresponding  periods of 1994.  This increase was primarily  a  result  of
increased advertising and channel marketing program spending as the Company
continued its efforts to expand its market share.  Although the Company has
increased  its  selling and marketing expenses in an effort to  expand  its
market  share, there can be no assurance that such an increase in  spending
will  result  in  a corresponding increase in market share.   Despite  this
increase  in  expenditures,  selling, general and  administrative  expenses
remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales in the third  quarter
and  first nine months of 1995 when compared with the corresponding periods
of  1994,  primarily as a result of the increase in the level of net  sales
combined  with  the  Company's ongoing efforts to  manage  total  operating
expense growth.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses relative  to  gross  margin  levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross  margins, and continued competitive pressures worldwide.  The Company
anticipates that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase
in amount during the remaining quarter of 1995.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $12
million  in  income  in  the  third  quarter  of  1995  compared  with  the
corresponding  period  of  1994.   Higher cash  and  short-term  investment
balances  coupled  with  higher  investment  interest  rates  resulted   in
increased  interest income of approximately $15 million.  The  increase  in
income  was  partially offset by increased interest expense due  to  higher
borrowing  rates  and  increased hedging costs as  a  result  of  increased
volatility in the currency exchange markets as the value of the U.S. dollar
declined relative to other foreign currencies.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $16
million in expense in the first nine months of 1995 when compared with  the
corresponding  period of 1994.  Net losses recorded for the  mark-to-market
valuation  of  outstanding  currency forwards  and  sold  currency  options
undertaken  for  currency risk management purposes  and  costs  related  to
foreign  exchange  risk management activity during  the  second  and  third
quarters  of  1995  resulted  in increased expenses  of  approximately  $56
million  when  compared  with  the corresponding  periods  of  1994.   This
increase  in  expense  was partially offset by an approximate  $41  million
increase in interest and other income, net, during the first nine months of
1995 when compared with the corresponding period of 1994, reflecting higher
cash  and  short-term  investment balances coupled with  higher  investment
interest rates.

Notional  principal  amounts on certain of the Company's  foreign  exchange
instruments increased significantly compared with the balances at September
30,  1994,  in  accordance  with  the Company's  currency  risk  management
strategies.  Specifically, notional principal amounts on purchased and sold
foreign   exchange   options  not  accounted  for   as   hedges   increased
approximately  $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively,  compared  with
the balances at September 30. 1994.  The notional principal amounts for off-
balance-sheet  instruments provide one measure of  the  transaction  volume
outstanding at a particular point in time, and do not necessarily represent
the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market risk.

Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report  on  Form

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on  the Company's ability to successfully develop,  manufacture,
and  market  technologically innovative products in order to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future operating results and financial condition.

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's  ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the  availability of application software for new products,  the  effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and
the manufacturing of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated
demand.  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.

In  1994,  the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of  Macintosh
computers  based  on  a  new PowerPC family of RISC  microprocessors.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition may  be  adversely
affected  if  it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its
lines  of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series  of
microprocessors  to  the  PowerPC(registered trademark) microprocessor.   
The  success  of  this ongoing transition will depend on the Company's 
ability to continue to sell products  based  on  the  Motorola 68000 series
of  microprocessors  while gaining  market acceptance of the new PowerPC 
processor-based products,  to successfully  manage inventory levels of both 
product lines simultaneously, and  to  continue to coordinate the timely 
development and distribution  by independent   software  vendors  of  new  
"native"  software   applications specifically designed for the PowerPC 
processor-based products.

The  rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new
product  is  not necessarily an indication of the future rate of  shipments
for  that  product, which depends on many factors, some of  which  are  not
under  the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to  purchase
new  technology  prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users  ("early
adopters");  purchases  in  satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by  users  who
anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of  other
products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to  the
aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,
such as the deferral of purchases by many users until new

                                       11
<PAGE>

technology  is  accepted as "proven" and for which commonly  used  software
products  are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers  once  they
believe they can obtain sufficient supply of product previously in backlog.

Backlog  is  often  volatile after new product  introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned  demand  factors, often increasing sharply  coincident  with
introduction, and then reducing sharply once dealers and customers  believe
they can obtain sufficient supply of product.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability  of  European-language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial  demand for the Company's new products  outside  the  United
States,  even  though localized versions of the Company's products  may  be
available.

Competition

The  personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues  to  be
characterized  by  consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,
aggressive pricing practices, and downward pressure on gross margins.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected  should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact  of
industry-wide pricing pressures.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected   by   the  Company's  ability  to  offer  customers   competitive
technologies while effectively managing the impact on inventory levels  and
the potential for customer confusion created by product proliferation.

On  November  7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with  International
Business  Machines Corporation (IBM) and Motorola, Inc. on a  new  hardware
reference  platform  for the PowerPC microprocessor  that  is  intended  to
deliver a much wider range of operating system and application choices  for
computer customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company intends  to
make  the  Macintosh  operating system available on  the  common  platform.
Accordingly,    the  Company's  future  operating  results  and   financial
condition  may  be affected by its ability to implement this agreement  and
certain  other  collaboration  agreements, and  to  manage  the  associated
competitive risk.

The  Company  is  currently the primary maker of  hardware  that  uses  the
Macintosh  operating  system, and it has a minority  market  share  in  the
personal  computer market, which is dominated by makers of  computers  that
run the MS-DOS(registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows(trademark) 
operating systems.  Future operating results and financial condition may be 
affected by the Company's ability to increase  market share in its personal 
computer business.  As part  of  its efforts  to  increase  overall  market 
share,  the  Company  announced  the licensing  of  the  Macintosh operating
system to other  personal  computer vendors  in January 1995, and several 
vendors are currently selling product
which  utilizes the Macintosh operating system.  The Company's  efforts  to
increase  its  overall  market share through  licensing  of  the  Macintosh
operating  system  will  depend in part on the  success  of  the  Company's
ability  to manage the risks associated with competing companies  producing
Macintosh  OS-based  computer  systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot
determine  the  ultimate effect that licensing of the  Macintosh  operating
system  will  have  on  its product sales or future operating  results  and
financial  condition.   The Company believes that licensing  the  operating
system  will  result in a broader installed base on which software  vendors
can  develop and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh  platform.
However,  there  can  be  no  assurance that the  installed  base  will  be
broadened by the licensing of the operating system or result in an increase
in  the  number of application software titles or the rate at which vendors
will  bring to market application software based on the Macintosh operating
system.

The  Company's principal competitor in producing operating system software,
Microsoft  Corporation, is a large, well-financed corporation which  has  a
dominant  position  in various segments of the personal  computer  software
industry.  Microsoft Corporation is expected to release Windows 95, another
of  its operating system offerings, in the next several weeks.  The Company
believes  that  this event will likely create competitive pressure  on  the
Company and will further challenge the Company's efforts in developing  and
marketing  the  Company's  products.   Accordingly,  the  Company's  future
operating  results and financial condition could be adversely  affected  by
the release of Windows 95.

Certain  of the Company's personal computer products are capable of running
application software designed for the MS-DOS or

                                       12
<PAGE>

Windows  operating systems, through software emulation of Intel Corporation
microprocessor  chips  by  use of software specifically  designed  for  the
Company's  products,  either those based on the Motorola  68000  series  of
microprocessors or those based on the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  Company
has  also introduced products which include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601
microprocessor  and  the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor which  enable  users  to
switch between Macintosh and DOS computing environments.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed  to  MS-DOS  or  Windows-based systems,  are  often  based  on  the
availability  of  third-party  software for particular  applications.   The
Company  believes that the availability of third-party application software
for  the  Company's  hardware products depends in part on  the  third-party
developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of  developing
such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger MS-
DOS  and  Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors  such  as  the
relative  market share of the Company's products, the anticipated potential
revenue  that  may  be  earned, and the costs of developing  such  software
products.   Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of  application
software for the Company's products.  Accordingly, Microsoft's interest  in
producing application software for the Company's products may be influenced
by Microsoft's perception of its interests as an operating system vendor.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
new  PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors which produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by  most personal computers  using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows  operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based  on  the
Intel microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also
the  developer  of  OS/2,  a competing operating system  to  the  Company's
Macintosh  operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying  the
Company  with  improved  versions  of  microprocessors  for  the  Company's
products  may  be  influenced by IBM's perception of  its  interests  as  a
competing  manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing  operating
system vendor.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by  the  Company's   ability  to  successfully  expand  its   new
businesses  and product offerings into other markets, such as  the  markets
for on-line services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.

Global Market Risks

A  large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international
operations.   As  a result, the Company's operations and financial  results
could  be significantly affected by international factors, such as  changes
in  foreign  currency  exchange rates or weak economic  conditions  in  the
foreign  markets in which the Company distributes its products.   When  the
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value  of
non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens,  the
U.S.    dollar   value   of   non-U.S.   dollar-based   sales    increases.
Correspondingly,  the  U.S.  dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based  costs
increases  when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S.  dollar
strengthens.   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of  currencies  other
than  the  U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar  and  is
adversely  affected  by  a  stronger dollar relative  to  major  currencies
worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may  negatively  affect
the  Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed  in  U.S.
dollars).

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on
the   Company's  non-U.S.  dollar-based  sales,  product  procurement,  and
operating  expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based
exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange  forward
and  option  contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.   Currently,
hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The
Company  also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge  certain
other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,
but  not  firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.   To
reduce  the  costs  associated with these ongoing foreign exchange  hedging
programs,  the  Company  also  regularly  sells  foreign  exchange   option
contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All
foreign  exchange forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges,
including all transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the
Company's foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value  and
are adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.

While  the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the  interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's  leading  industrialized  countries,  the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations  in
the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard,

                                       13
<PAGE>

changes  in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's
cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid
on its short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact of
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into  interest
rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps are intended  to
better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash,  cash
equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest  rate
swap,  swaption, and option transactions in order to extend  the  effective
duration  of  a  portion  of  its  cash, cash  equivalent,  and  short-term
investment portfolios. These swaps may extend the Company's cash investment
horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.

To  ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange
and  interest  rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor  the  risks  and
opportunities of the non hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors
its  foreign  exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate
swap,  swaption,  and  option  positions on  a  stand-alone  basis  and  in
conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related
exposures,   respectively,  from  both  an  accounting  and   an   economic
perspective.   However, given the effective horizons of the Company's  risk
management  activities, there can be no assurance that  the  aforementioned
programs  will  offset more than a portion of the adverse financial  impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of  gains
and  losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period  may
not  coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying
economic  exposures,  and  as  such, may  adversely  affect  the  Company's
operating results and financial position.

Inventory and Supply

The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited  by
the  availability  of  key  components.   The  Company  believes  that  the
availability   from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer   industry   of
microprocessors,  application  specific integrated  circuits  (ASIC's)  and
dynamic  random access memory (DRAM) present the most significant potential
for  constraining  the  Company's ability  to  produce  product.   Specific
microprocessors  manufactured by Motorola,  Inc.,  and  IBM  are  currently
available only from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors are
currently  in  the  early stages of ramp-up for production  and  thus  have
limited availability.  The current market for DRAM is very constrained, and
competition  for  DRAM  among producers of personal computers  is  intense,
based  in  part  on  the  increased requirements for  DRAM  made  by  newer
operating  systems such as Windows 95.  The Company and other producers  in
the  personal  computer  industry  also  compete  for  other  semiconductor
products  with other industries that have experienced increased demand  for
such  products due to either increased consumer demand or increased use  of
semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and automotive
industries.)  Finally, the Company uses some components that are not common
to  the  rest of the personal computer industry (including certain  ASICs).
Continued  availability of these components may be  affected  if  producers
were  to  decide  to  concentrate on the production  of  common  components
instead  of custom components.  The Company's future operating results  and
financial condition could be adversely affected by such product constraints
and increased costs, including loss of market share.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage inventory levels  and
lead times required to obtain components in order to be more responsive  to
short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In addition, if anticipated
unit  sales  growth for new and current product offerings is not  realized,
inventory  valuation reserves may be necessary that would adversely  affect
the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution of
the  Company's  products.   Currently,  the  Company's  primary  means   of
distribution  is  through  third-party computer  resellers.   However,  the
Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels, such as
mass-merchandise   stores  consumer  electronics  outlets,   and   computer
superstores.   The  Company's  business  and  financial  results  could  be
adversely  affected if the financial condition of these sellers weakens  or
if  sellers  within consumer channels decide not to continue to  distribute
the Company's products.

Other Factors

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

The Company plans to replace its current transaction systems (which include
order management, distribution, manufacturing, and

                                       14
<PAGE>

finance)  with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort  to
increase  operational efficiency.  The Company's future  operating  results
and  financial  condition could be adversely affected  by  its  ability  to
implement  and  effectively manage the transition to  this  new  integrated
system.

In April 1995, the Company announced a company-wide reorganization designed
to  more  closely  align the Company's organizational  structure  with  the
Company's  business strategy of placing increased focus on  customer  needs
and  expanding  its presence in the home, education, and business  markets.
The  Company's  future operating results and financial condition  could  be
adversely  affected by its ability to effectively manage the transition  to
this new organizational structure.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Cash generated by financing activities          $118
                                        
The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments, net of short-term borrowings increased  to  $1,270
million  at  June 30, 1995 from $966 million at September 30,  1994.   This
increase  was primarily attributable to the Company's continued efforts  to
increase profit levels and to manage working capital, particularly  in  the
areas of inventory, accounts payable and accounts receivable.

Cash  generated by operations during the first nine months of 1995  totaled
$433  million.  Cash was generated primarily by higher sales levels related
to  a  shift in product mix towards higher-margin products which  typically
have higher average selling prices.

Net  cash  used  for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  totaled
approximately  $110 million during the first nine months  of  1995.   These
purchases  primarily included manufacturing machinery and  equipment.   The
Company  anticipates that capital expenditures in 1995 will  be  relatively
consistent with 1994 expenditures of $160 million.

Short-term  borrowings  at  June 30, 1995 were approximately  $114  million
higher than at September 30, 1994.  These borrowings were primarily made to
fund  expected  working  capital growth in certain markets  worldwide.   In
general,  the Company's short-term borrowings typically reflect  borrowings
made under its commercial paper program and short-term uncommitted bid-line
arrangements  with certain commercial banks.  In particular,  Apple  Japan,
Inc., and Apple Computer BV, (Netherlands) wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company,  incurred  short-term  borrowings  from  several  banks,  totaling
approximately  $233  million and $173 million, respectively,  at  June  30,
1995.

Long-term  borrowings of $303 million at June 30, 1995 remained  consistent
with the balance at September 30, 1994.  Substantially the entire amount of
long-term borrowings represents $300 million aggregate principal amount  of
6.5%  unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration  statement
filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.   This  shelf
registration  covers the registration of debt and other securities  for  an
aggregate  offering price of up to $500 million.  The notes  were  sold  at
99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay
interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short-  and  long-term
borrowings  from  time  to time generally to finance U.S.  working  capital
needs  and  capital  expenditures, because a  substantial  portion  of  the
Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term

                                       15
<PAGE>

investments   is   held  by  foreign  subsidiaries,   generally   in   U.S.
dollar-denominated holdings.  Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be
subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States; the
Company's  financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability
on amounts that it reasonably expects may be repatriated.

The  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  has  proposed  federal  income  tax
deficiencies  for  the years 1984 through 1991, and the  Company  has  made
certain   prepayments   thereon.   The  Company  contested   the   proposed
deficiencies  for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of  the  issues  in
dispute  for  these years  have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995,  the  IRS
issued  a  notice of deficiency proposing increases to the  amount  of  the
Company's  federal  income  taxes for the years  1989  through  1991.   The
Company  intends to file a petition with the United States  Tax  Court   to
contest  these alleged tax deficiencies.  Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these  tax
examinations.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.


PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 39 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-
K  under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain litigation
involving Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company.

In  the  case of Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-
Packard Company, the Company's petition for a writ of certiorari was denied
by   the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  on  February  21,  1995.
Accordingly, the decision of the appellate court affirming the dismissal of
the  Company's  copyright infringement case against  Microsoft  Corporation
("Microsoft")  and  Hewlett-Packard Company  ("HP")  is  now  final.   HP's
request  for  attorneys'  fees has been settled by  agreement  between  the
Company and HP.  Microsoft's request for attorneys' fees remains pending.

The  Company believes the resolution of the above matter will  not  have  a
material  adverse  effect  on  its  financial  condition  and  results   of
operations as reported in the accompanying financial statements.   However,
depending  on  the  amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution  of  the
matter,  it is possible that the Company's future results of operations  or
cash flows could be materially affected in a particular period.

                                SUPPLEMENT TO THE
                                        
                  APPLE COMPUTER, INC. EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
                                        
                            (Effective June 9, 1995)
                                        
SECTION 1.     ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.

           This  Supplement  (the "Supplement") to the  Apple  Computer,  Inc.
Executive  Severance Plan (the "Plan") is hereby established effective  as  of
the date it is approved by the Board of Directors of Apple (the "Board").  The
purpose  of  this Supplement is to set forth the terms and provisions  of  the
Plan  that  will  apply  in  the  event of  a  Change  in  Control  of  Apple.
Capitalized  words  not  otherwise defined  herein  shall  have  the  meanings
assigned to such words in the Plan.

SECTION 2.     ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.

          (a)  Each Eligible Employee (i) whose employment with the Company is
involuntary  terminated by the Company for any reason  during  the  Supplement
Term,  other than due to such Employee's misuse of confidential or proprietary
information or a violation of the standards described in Apple's Global Ethics
brochure or any other Apple policy or guideline or (ii) who resigns during the
Supplement  Term  for  Good Reason shall automatically become  a  Participant,
whether  or not such person is designated as a Participant in accordance  with
Section 3.1 of the Plan (hereinafter, a "Section 2(a) Participant"); provided,
however,  that no Eligible Employee described in Section 3.3(c), (d),  (e)  or
(f),  or  an  Eligible Employee described in Section 3.3(b) who resigns  other
than  for  Good Reason, shall become a Section 2(a) Participant.  In addition,
during the Supplement Term, the definition of "Eligible Employee" in the  Plan
is  revised  to exclude reference to "any other plan, program or  practice  by
which  Apple  provides any separation allowance" which is  established  on  or
after the Change in Control Date or which is implemented at any time with  the
intention,  express or implied, of eliminating Apple's obligations  under  the
Plan  or  this Supplement. Employees of the Company who are otherwise Eligible
Employees  and who are parties to a Retention Agreement shall continue  to  be
eligible  to  be  designated as Participants in the Plan if  their  employment
terminates prior to the Change in Control Date or after the expiration of  the
term of their Retention Agreement.

           (b)   Section 4.1(e) of the Plan is revised to prohibit the Company
from  ending  the  Termination Notice Period for any such  Termination  Notice
Period  that begins within the Supplement Term for any reason other  than  the
Section  2(a) Participant's misuse of confidential or proprietary  information
or a violation of the standards described in Apple's Global Ethics brochure or
any other Apple policy or guideline.

          (c)  Section 4.3 of the Plan is revised to substitute "30 additional
calendar  days"  for "14 additional calendar days" for any Termination  Notice
Period that begins during the Supplemental Term.

           (d)   Section 4.5 of the Plan is revised to require the Company  to
provide   job  placement  assistance  or  counseling  to  each  Section   2(a)
Participant  who  requests  such  assistance;  provided,  however,  that   the
individual Participant cost to Apple of providing such benefits to  a  Section
2(a) Participant need not exceed $7,500.

           (e)   Section  7.1  of the Plan is revised for  each  Section  2(a)
Participant as follows:

Years of Service*    Months of Pay
                    
3 or less                   8

  actual termination date.
                                       19
           (f)   Section  7.2  of the Plan is revised for  each  Section  2(a)
Participant  as  follows:  In lieu of the Prorated Bonus,  each  Section  2(a)
Participant  shall  receive a special severance bonus (the "Severance  Bonus")
equal  to  the  greater of (i) the target annual bonus amount payable  to  the
Section  2(a)  Participant for the fiscal year in which the Notification  Date
occurs  and  (ii) the target annual bonus amount payable to the  Section  2(a)
Participant  for  the last fiscal year ended prior to the  Change  in  Control
Date,  in  either  case,  calculated on the  assumption  that  all  applicable
performance  targets  had been achieved.  The Severance  Bonus  shall  not  be
subject  to  any  proration and shall otherwise be payable at  such  time  and
manner as the Prorated Bonus.

           (g)   Section  7.3  of the Plan is revised for  each  Section  2(a)
Participant as follows:

at Close of              Close  of  Termination

94-96                    18 months
                
          (h)  The additional payments and benefits provided by this Section 2
of  the  Supplement  are  subject  to the  condition  that  the  Section  2(a)
Participant execute a release in the form and manner contemplated  by  Section
5.2 of the Plan.

SECTION 3.     GROSS-UP PAYMENT.

          A new Section 7.8 is added to the Plan as follows:

          7.8   Gross-Up Payment.

           (a)  Right to Payment.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the
Supplement  to  the  contrary, if it is determined  that  any  Payment  to  an
Eligible  Employee (whether or not such employee qualifies for benefits  under
the  Plan or the Supplement and whether or not such employee is a Section 2(a)
Participant at the time of determination) would be subject to the  excise  tax
imposed  by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties with respect
to  such  excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties
thereon,  is  herein  referred  to as an "Excise  Tax"),  then  such  Eligible
Employee shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")  in
an  amount  that  will  place such Eligible Employee  in  the  same  after-tax
economic position that such employee would have enjoyed if the Excise Tax  had
not  applied  to  the Payment.  The amount of the Gross-Up  Payment  shall  be
determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula {(E  x  (1  -
M)/(1  -  T))  -  E}  (or  such  other formula as the  Accounting  Firm  deems
appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

          E    equals   the  Payments  which  are  determined  to  be  "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of
               the Code;
     
          M    equals  the  sum  of  the  highest marginal  rates1  for  Taxes
               applicable to the Eligible Employee at the time of the Payment;
               and

          T    equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable to an Eligible Employee hereunder if the
Accounting Firm determines that the Payments to such Eligible Employee are not
subject to an Excise Tax.

           (b)   Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the provisions
of  Section  7.8(c),  all  determinations required  under  this  Section  7.8,
including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of the  Payments
constituting  excess  parachute  payments, and  the  amount  of  the  Gross-Up
Payment,  shall  be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide  detailed
supporting  calculations both to the Eligible Employee and the Company  within
fifteen  days  of  the  Change  in Control Date,  the  date  of  the  Eligible
Employee's termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries  or
any other date reasonably requested by the Eligible Employee or the Company on
which  a  determination under this Section 3 is necessary or  advisable.   The
Company shall pay each Eligible Employee the initial Gross-Up Payment within 5
days  of  the  receipt by the Company of the Accounting Firm's  determination.
If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable to an Eligible
Employee  (or  class  of  Eligible Employees), the  Company  shall  cause  the
Accounting Firm to provide such Eligible Employee (or each member of the class
of   Eligible  Employees)  with  an  opinion  that  the  Accounting  Firm  has
substantial authority under the Code and Regulations not to report

                                       20

an  Excise  Tax  on the Eligible Employee's federal income  tax  return.   Any
determination  by  the  Accounting Firm shall be  binding  upon  the  Eligible
Employee and the Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient  to
cover  the amount of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined to be  owing
by  the  Eligible  Employee  with  respect  to  any  Payment  (hereinafter  an
"Underpayment"),  the  Company, after exhausting its  remedies  under  Section
7.8(c) below, shall promptly pay to the Eligible Employee an additional Gross-
Up Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

          (c)  Procedures.  As a condition to Apple's obligations hereunder to
an Eligible Employee, each Eligible Employee shall be required to notify Apple
in  writing  of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful,
would  require  the payment by Apple of a Gross-Up Payment  by  such  Eligible
Employee.   Such  notice  shall  be given as soon  as  practicable  after  the
Eligible Employee knows of such claim and shall apprise Apple of the nature of
the  claim  and  the  date on which the claim is requested  to  be  paid.   An
Eligible Employee shall agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the
thirty-day  period following the date on which the Eligible Employee  notifies
Apple,  or  such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect  to
such  claim  are  due  (the "Notice Period"). If Apple notifies  the  Eligible
Employee  in  writing  prior to the expiration of the Notice  Period  that  it
desires to contest the claim, the Eligible Employee shall:  (i) give Apple any
information  reasonably requested by Apple relating to the  claim;  (ii)  take
such  action  in  connection with the claim as Apple may  reasonably  request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect  to
such  claim  by  an  attorney  reasonably selected  by  Apple  and  reasonably
acceptable to the Eligible Employee; (iii) cooperate with Apple in good  faith
in  contesting  the  claim;  and  (iv) permit  Apple  to  participate  in  any
proceedings relating to the claim.  An Eligible Employee shall permit Apple to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit  Apple
to  pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings,
and  conferences  with  the taxing authority in respect  of  such  claim.   If
requested  by Apple, an Eligible Employee shall agree either to  pay  the  tax
claimed  and  sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible  manner
and  to  prosecute  such contest to a determination before any  administrative
tribunal,  in  a  court of initial jurisdiction and in one or  more  appellate
courts  as  Apple shall determine; provided, however, that, if  Apple  directs
such  Eligible  Employee to pay such claim and pursue a  refund,  Apple  shall
advance  the  amount of such payment to the Eligible Employee on an  after-tax
and  interest-free  basis (the "Advance").  Apple's  control  of  the  contest
related  to  the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the  Gross-Up
Payment  and the Eligible Employee shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as
the  case  may be, any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service  or
other  taxing  authority.  If Apple does not notify the Eligible  Employee  in
writing  prior  to the end of the Notice Period of its desire to  contest  the
claim, Apple shall pay to the Eligible Employee an additional Gross-Up Payment
in respect of the excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim,
and  the  Eligible Employee shall be required to pay the amount of the  Excise
Tax  that  is  the subject of the claim to the applicable taxing authority  in
accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by an Eligible Employee of  an
Advance,  the Eligible Employee becomes entitled to a refund with  respect  to
the claim to which such Advance relates, the Eligible Employee shall pay Apple
the  amount of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon
after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by Eligible Employee of an
Advance,  a  determination is made that the Eligible  Employee  shall  not  be
entitled  to any refund with respect to the claim and Apple does not  promptly
notify  the  Eligible Employee of its intent to contest the denial of  refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by Eligible
Employee  and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of  the  additional
Gross-Up Payment then owing to the Eligible Employee.

           (e)   Further  Assurances.   Apple shall  indemnify  each  Eligible
Employee and hold each Eligible Employee harmless, on an after-tax basis, from
any   costs,   expenses,  penalties,  fines,  interest  or  other  liabilities
("Losses")  incurred by the Eligible Employee with respect to the exercise  by
Apple  of  any  of  its  rights  under this Section  7.8,  including,  without
limitation, any Losses related to Apple's decision to contest a claim  or  any
imputed  income to the Eligible Employee resulting from any Advance or  action
taken on Eligible Employee on behalf by Apple hereunder.  Apple shall pay  all
legal  fees  and expenses incurred under this Section 7.8, and shall  promptly
reimburse each Eligible Employee for the reasonable expenses incurred  by  the
Eligible Employee in connection with any actions taken by Apple or required to
be  taken by the Eligible Employee hereunder.  Apple shall also pay all of the
fees  and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without limitation,  the
fees and expenses related to the opinion referred to in Section 7.8(b).

           (f)   Combined  Payments.   Anything in this  Section  7.8  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, Apple shall have no obligation to pay  an  Eligible
Employee  a required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 7.8 if the  aggregate
amount  of all Combined Payments has at the time such payment is due  exceeded
the  Limit.  If the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to an Eligible Employee under
this  Section 7.8 would result in the Combined Payments exceeding  the  Limit,
Apple  shall  pay the Eligible Employee the portion, if any, of  the  Gross-Up
Payment  which  can  be  paid to such employee without causing  the  aggregate
amount  of  all Combined Payments to exceed the Limit.  In the event  that  an
Eligible Employee is entitled to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 7.8 and
other employees or former employees of the Company are also entitled to gross-
up  payments  under this Section 7.8 or under the corresponding provisions  of
any other applicable Combined Arrangement and the aggregate amount of all such
payments  would  cause the Limit on Combined Payments to  be  exceeded,  Apple
shall  allocate the amount of the reduction necessary to comply with the Limit
among  all such payments in the proportion that the amount of each such gross-
up  payment  bears to the aggregate amount of all such payments.   Nothing  in
this Section 7.8(f) shall require any Eligible Employee to repay to Apple  any
amount that was previously paid to such employee under this Section 7.8.
                                       21

SECTION 4.     AMENDMENT AND ASSUMPTION.

           (a)  Section 12.1 of the Plan is revised as follows:  The Plan  and
this  Supplement may not be amended or terminated by Apple on  and  after  the
occurrence  of  the  Change in Control Date in any way that  would  reduce  or
eliminate  the payments and benefits owing under the Plan and this  Supplement
to  any  Section  2(a) Participant.  In addition, no amendment or  termination
which  would be precluded under the previous sentence if made on or after  the
Change  in  Control Date shall be effective if made or first effective  within
the twelve month period ending on the Change in Control Date.

           (b)   Apple will require any successor (whether direct or indirect,
by  purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially  all
of the business or assets of Apple expressly to assume and to agree to perform
this  Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Apple would  be
required  to  perform  it  if no such succession had  taken  place;  provided,
however,  that  no  such  assumption shall relieve Apple  of  its  obligations
hereunder.

SECTION 5.     DEFINITIONS.

           For  purposes  of  the  Plan  and this  Supplement,  the  following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

that, anything in the Plan or this Supplement to the contrary notwithstanding,
a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

           (i)   any  individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,

     Exchange  Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined  in  Rule
     13d-3  of  the  General Rules and Regulations under  the  Exchange  Act),

     of  the  combined  voting  power of Apple's then  outstanding  securities
     entitled to vote in the election of directors of Apple;
     
           (ii)  during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including

     the beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new directors,
     whose  election  by  the  Board or nomination  for  election  by  Apple's
     stockholders was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of
     the  directors  then  still in office who either were  directors  at  the
     beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election  was
     previously so approved (the "Incumbent Directors"), cease for any  reason
     to constitute a majority thereof;
     
           (iii)      There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation  or
     other  corporate transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),  in
     each  case,  with  respect  to  which the  stockholders  of  the  Company
     immediately  prior  to  such Transaction do not,  immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power of the
     Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
     
           (iv)  all  or  substantially all of the assets of Apple  are  sold,
     liquidated or distributed; or
     
           (v)  there is a "change in control" of Apple within the meaning  of

4(b) of this Supplement.  If the Change in Control Date occurs as a result  of
an  agreement described in clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as a result
of  the  approval  of  the Board described in clause  (iii)  of  the  previous
sentence and the Change in Control to which such agreement or approval relates
(the  "Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then  the
Supplement Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date")  following
the  date  the  Board  certifies by resolution duly adopted  by  three-fourths
(3/4ths)  of  the  Incumbent Directors then in office  that  the  Contemplated
Change  in Control is not reasonably likely to occur; provided, however,  that
this  sentence  shall  not  apply (A) to any Section  2(a)  Participant  whose
termination of employment with Apple has occurred on and after the  Change  in
Control Date and on or prior to the Reset Date or (B) if the

                                       22
<PAGE>

Contemplated Change in Control subsequently occurs within three months of  the
Reset  Date.  Following the Reset Date, the provisions of the  Plan  and  this
Supplement  shall  remain in effect and a new Supplement Term  shall  commence
upon  the  occurrence of a subsequent Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding
the  first  sentence of this section, if an individual's employment  with  the
Company  terminates prior to the Change in Control Date and it  is  reasonably
demonstrated that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of the
third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect the Change  in
Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation  of  the
Change in Control, then, solely with respect to the affected Participant,  the
Change  in Control Date shall mean the date immediately prior to the  date  of
such Participant's termination of employment.

Participants  under Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or to  any  other
employee  or  former  employee  under  the  corresponding  provisions  of  the
applicable  Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-up Payments made to an  Eligible
Employee under Section 3 of the Supplement or to any other employee or  former
employee  under  the  corresponding  provisions  of  the  applicable  Combined
Arrangement, (iv) fees and expenses which are paid or reimbursed to  employees
or  former  employees under Section 6 of the Retention Agreements  or  to  any
other  employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions  of  the
applicable  Combined  Arrangement, (v) payments made to  employees  or  former
employees under Section 5 of the Retention Agreements or to any other employee
or  former  employee  under  the corresponding provisions  of  the  applicable
Combined Arrangement and (vi) costs incurred by Apple in respect of a  Section
2(a) Participant under Section 2(d) of the Supplement or to any other employee
or  former  employee  under  the corresponding provisions  of  the  applicable
Combined Arrangement.

     ordinary course of business prior to the Change in Control Date); or
     
           (ii) The Company's assignment of an Eligible Employee to a job with
     significantly  reduced  duties and responsibilities  and  which  involves
     either   (A) a reduction in the Eligible Employee's base salary or target
     bonus  opportunity  or  (B)  a drop of two grade  designations  or  more;
     provided,  however, that clause (B) shall not apply if the  reduction  in
     employee's grade designation causes such employee to cease to qualify  as
     an Eligible Employee for purposes of the Plan and this Supplement;
     
provided,  however,  that an event described above shall not  constitute  Good
Reason  unless it is communicated by the Eligible Employee to the  Company  in

satisfactory  to the Eligible Employee (including full retroactive  correction

               the  National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated
               Quotation ("NASDAQ") System, the highest closing sale price (or
               closing  bid  price, if no sales are reported) of  a  share  of
               Common Stock, or (B) if the Common Stock is

               Control  Date, and (ii) the highest price paid or  offered,  as

such definition.

           "Payment" means (i) any amount due or paid to an Eligible  Employee
under  the Plan or this Supplement, (ii) any amount that is due or paid to  an
Eligible  Employee under any plan, program or arrangement of the Company,  and
(iii)  any  amount  or benefit that is due or payable to an Eligible  Employee

EXHIBIT 10.A.21

                             DATA List of Officers


June 9, 1995
Mr. "Name"
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, California 95014

                                        
                               Retention Agreement


Dear "First name":

           Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation  (the "Company"),
considers  it essential to the best interests of its stockholders  to  take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty  and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change  in
control  of  the  Company could result in the departure or  distraction  of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

           The  Board  has  determined, therefore, that  appropriate  steps
should  be  taken  to reinforce and encourage the continued  attention  and
dedication   of  members  of  the  management  of  the  Company   and   its
subsidiaries,   including  yourself,  to  their  assigned  duties   without
distraction  in  the  face of potentially disturbing circumstances  arising
from any possible change in control of the Company.

           In  order to induce you to remain in the employ of the  Company,
the  Company  has  determined  to enter into this  letter  agreement  (this
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in
the  event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words  which
are  not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to  such
words in Section 8 of this Agreement.

           1.    Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of  your
employment  under  this Agreement shall commence on the Change  in  Control
Date  and  shall  continue until the second anniversary of  the  Change  in
Control Date (the "Term").

           2.   Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

          (a)  Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, nature
and  status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no  less
favorable  to  you  than those that you enjoyed immediately  prior  to  the
Change in Control Date.

           (b)   Salary  and  Bonus.   Your base salary  and  annual  bonus
opportunity  may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

            (c)    Incentive  Compensation.   You  shall  be  eligible   to
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established  by
the  Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms  and
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent  with  the
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

           (d)   Benefits.   You  shall be eligible to participate  in  all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides  to its executive employees in accordance with the terms  of  such
plans  and  arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you,  in  the
aggregate,  than  the  terms and provisions available  to  other  executive
employees of the Company.

           (e)  Location.  You will continue to be employed at the business
location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control Date and
the  amount  of time that you are required to travel for business  purposes
will  not  be  increased  in any significant respect  from  the  amount  of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.

                                       25

          3.   Involuntary Termination During the Term.

           (a)   Severance  Payment.   In the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the
date  of  such  Involuntary Termination the full amount of any  earned  but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at
the  time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated  on
the  basis of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you
may have accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay
you  within  5  days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion  of  the
annual  bonus  for  the year in which your Involuntary Termination  occurs,
calculated  on  the basis of your target bonus for that  year  and  on  the
assumption that all performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In
addition,  the  Company shall pay you in a cash lump  sum,  within  8  days
following the date of your execution of the release described in  the  last
sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of Termination, if later), an
amount  (the  "Severance Payment") equal to the sum of (i) two  times  your
Reference  Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.   The  Severance
Payment  shall  be in lieu of any other severance payments  which  you  are
entitled  to  receive  under any other severance pay  plan  or  arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance
Payment  shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor  of
the  Company  in  substantially the form of the release  required  for  the
receipt of severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the
date  of  this Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the  seven-day
revocation period specified therein.

            (b)   Benefit  Payment.   In  the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination  during  the  Term,  you and  your  eligible  dependents  shall
continue  to  be  eligible to participate during the  Benefit  Continuation
Period  (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health,  life  and
other  fringe benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you  immediately
prior  to your Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions  in
effect  for  you and your dependents immediately prior to such  Involuntary
Termination.   For purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation
Period" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on
the  earlier  to  occur  of  (i) the second  anniversary  of  the  Date  of
Termination and (ii) the date that you and your dependents are eligible and
elect  coverage  under  the plans of a subsequent  employer  which  provide
substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you and your dependents.

           (c)   Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination  of  your
employment  by the Company or by you during the Term shall be  communicated
by  a  notice  of  termination to the other party hereto  (the  "Notice  of
Termination").   The  Notice  of Termination shall  indicate  the  specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth  in
reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide  a  basis
for  termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.   The
date   of  your  termination  of  employment  with  the  Company  and   its
subsidiaries  (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined  as  follows:
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not have returned
to  the  full-time performance of your duties during such thirty  (30)  day
period),  (ii)  if  your employment is terminated  by  the  Company  in  an
Involuntary  Termination,  five (5) days  after  the  date  the  Notice  of
Termination  is received by you and (iii) if your employment is  terminated
by  the Company for Cause, the later of the date specified in the Notice of
Termination or ten (10) days following the date such notice is received  by
you.  If the basis for your Involuntary Termination is your resignation for
Good  Reason, the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date
your  Notice  of  Termination is received by the  Company.    The  Date  of
Termination  for  a resignation of employment other than  for  Good  Reason
shall  be  the date set forth in the applicable notice, which shall  be  no
earlier  than ten (10) days after the date such notice is received  by  the
Company.

           (d)   No  Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not  be  required  to
mitigate  the  amount  of any payment provided for  in  this  Agreement  by
seeking  other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment
or  benefit  provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any  compensation
earned by you as the result of employment by another employer or by pension
benefits  paid  by  the  Company or another  employer  after  the  Date  of
Termination or otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii)  of
the last sentence of Section 3(b).

          4.   Additional Payment.

           (a)   Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the
contrary,  if  it is determined that any Payment would be  subject  to  the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties
with  respect  to  such  excise tax (such excise  tax,  together  with  any
interest  or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise  Tax"),
then  you shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")
in  an  amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic  position
that  you  would  have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had  not  applied  to  the
Payment.   The  amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined  by  the
Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula
{(E  x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting  Firm
deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where
          E    equals  the  Payments  which are determined  to  be  "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
               280G(b)(1) of the Code;
     
                                       26
<PAGE>

          M    equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes
               applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

          T    equals  M  plus  the  rate of Excise Tax applicable  to  the
               Payment.

No  Gross-Up  Payments shall be payable hereunder if  the  Accounting  Firm
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

            (b)   Determination  of  Gross-Up  Payment.   Subject  to   the
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this  Section
4,  including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the  amount  of  the
Payments  constituting excess parachute payments, and  the  amount  of  the
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen
days  of the Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any  other
date  reasonably  requested by you or the Company on which a  determination
under  this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay  to
you  the  initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you  and
the Company of the Accounting Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm
determines  that no Excise Tax is payable by you, the Company  shall  cause
the Accounting Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm
has  substantial authority under the Code and Regulations not to report  an
Excise  Tax  on your federal income tax return.  Any determination  by  the
Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you and the Company.  If the  initial
Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover the amount of the Excise Tax that
is  ultimately  determined to be owing by you with respect to  any  Payment
(hereinafter an "Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies
under  Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional Gross-Up
Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

           (c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim  by  the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would  require
the  payment  by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice  shall  be
given as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise
the  Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim  is
requested  to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration
of  the  thirty-day  period following the date  on  which  you  notify  the
Company,  or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in
writing  prior  to the expiration of the Notice Period that it  desires  to
contest  the  claim,  you  shall:  (i) give  the  Company  any  information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii)  take  such
action  in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with  respect
to  such  claim  by  an attorney reasonably selected  by  the  Company  and
reasonably  acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with  the  Company  in  good
faith  in  contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate
in  any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings,  and  conferences with the taxing authority in  respect  of  such
claim.   If  requested  by the Company, you agree either  to  pay  the  tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner
and  to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal,  in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more  appellate
courts  as  the Company shall determine; provided, however,  that,  if  the
Company  directs  you  to pay such claim and pursue a refund,  the  Company
shall  advance  the  amount of such payment to  you  on  an  after-tax  and
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the  contest
related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
any  other  issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or  other  taxing
authority.  If the Company does not notify you in writing prior to the  end
of  the Notice Period of its desire to contest the claim, the Company shall
pay  to  you  an  additional  Gross-Up Payment in  respect  of  the  excess
parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and you agree to  pay
the  amount  of  the Excise Tax that is the subject of  the  claim  to  the
applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an  Advance,  you
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together  with
any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after  receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall
not  be  entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and  the  Company
does not promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid  by  you
and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up
Payment then owing to you.

           (e)   Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify  you  and
hold  you  harmless,  on  an  after-tax basis, from  any  costs,  expenses,
penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by  you
with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this
Section  4,  including,  without limitation,  any  Losses  related  to  the
Company's  decision  to  contest a claim  or  any  imputed  income  to  you
resulting  from any Advance or action taken on your behalf by  the  Company
hereunder.   The  Company shall pay all legal fees  and  expenses  incurred
under  this  Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  you in connection with any  actions  taken  by  the
Company  or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The Company shall  also
pay all of

                                       27

the   fees  and  expenses  of  the  Accounting  Firm,  including,   without
limitation,  the fees and expenses related to the opinion  referred  to  in
Section 4(b).

           (f)   Combined  Payments.   Anything in this Section  4  to  the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a
required  Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount  of
all  Combined  Payments has at the time such payment is  due  exceeded  the
Limit.   If  the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this  Section  4
would  result  in  the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit,  the  Company
shall  pay you only the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which  can
be  paid  to  you  without  causing the aggregate amount  of  all  Combined
Payments to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled to a Gross-
Up  Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or former employees of
the  Company are also entitled to gross-up payments under the corresponding
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangements and the aggregate amount
of  all  such  payments would cause the Limit on Combined  Payments  to  be
exceeded,  the Company shall allocate the amount of the reduction necessary
to comply with the Limit among all such payments in the proportion that the
amount  of each such gross-up payment bears to the aggregate amount of  all
such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) shall require you to repay  to
the  Company any amount that was previously paid to you under this  Section
4.

          5.   Other Provisions.

           (a)   Vesting  and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted  to  you
under  the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become
exercisable  in the event of your Involuntary Termination on  or  following
the Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date
of  the  Equity  Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will  vest  and
become exercisable as of such date.

           (b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the terms
of  the  Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that
the   Administrator  elects  not  to  cash  out  such  Equity  Awards,  the
Administrator has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of  all
or  substantially all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such
Equity  Awards to be assumed or an equivalent option or stock  appreciation
right  granted by the successor corporation to the Company or a  parent  or
subsidiary  of  such successor corporation, or (ii) to  provide  that  your
Equity Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning  on
the  date that you are so notified of such action by the Administrator  and
that such Equity Awards will expire to the extent not exercised at the  end
of such thirty-day period (the "30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator
determines  to  utilize the 30-Day Alternative, the Company shall  pay  you
with  respect to each such Equity Award the excess, if any (the "Additional
Amount"),  of the Change in Control Price you would have received  had  the
Equity  Award  been  cashed out on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control  over the value of the consideration actually received  by  you  in
settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such consideration  is
received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary Termination on
or  after  the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the  date  of  the
Equity  Plan  Change in Control, the Company shall pay you  the  Additional
Amount  as if your employment had continued through the date of the  Equity
Plan  Change  in  Control.  In either case, the payment of  the  Additional
Amount  shall  be  made  within 5 days following the determination  by  the
Administrator of the Change in Control Price.

           (c)   Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the  transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time  or  is
structured  in  such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely  that  you
would  be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing  profits
under  Section  16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability")  if
you  were to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through
a  merger)  of  your  Short-Term Awards as  part  of,  or  prior  to,  such
transaction and (ii) your inability to exercise, tender, sell or  otherwise
dispose  of  your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the date of such  Equity
Plan  Change in Control eliminates or reduces the value of some or  all  of
your  Short-Term  Awards, then, on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control,  the  Company  shall pay you in a cash  lump  sum  the  amount  of
"amount".  The provisions of clause (ii) of the previous sentence shall  be
deemed  to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising, tendering  or
otherwise  disposing  of  your  Short-Term  Awards  on  or  prior  to   the
Transaction  Date  in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit  Liability,  (b)  a
Short-Term  Award  cannot be repurchased, exchanged or  cashed-out  by  the
Company  (or  other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date  without  a
risk  of  Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are  required  to
delay  the  exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term
Awards  in  order  to  avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  such  delay
results  in your receiving consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued
at  the date such consideration is received) which is of lesser value  than
the  consideration you would have received (valued as of the  date  of  the
Equity Plan Change in Control) for such awards had such delay not occurred.
The  foregoing provisions shall apply to your Equity Awards notwithstanding
your Involuntary Termination of employment with the Company on or after the
Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control.  The
provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if (A) prior to the  Equity
Plan  Change  in Control, the Company provides you at its expense  with  an
opinion  from  a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating  that  the
exercise,  tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term  Awards  as
part  of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan  Change
in  Control  will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  (B)
following your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you  to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or
prior  to  the  Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing  the  value
thereof.

           (d)     General.   Anything in this Agreement  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding,   in  no  event  shall  the  vesting  and   exercisability
provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be  less
favorable to you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect  on
the date hereof.

          6.   Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you  on  an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including,  without
limitation,  court  costs  and reasonable legal  fees  and  expenses  which
reflect  common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred  by
you  as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your
termination  of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting,  disputing  or
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or  (iii)
arising  out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability
of  this  Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however,  that  the
amount  of  the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall  not
exceed $2 million.

          7.   Successors; Binding Agreement.

           (a)   Assumption  by  Successor. The Company  will  require  any
successor  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,  consolidation
or  otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement  in  the
same  manner  and to the same extent that the Company would be required  to
perform  it if no such succession had taken place; provided, however,  that
no  such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.
As  used  in  this  Agreement, the "Company"  shall  mean  the  Company  as
hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business  and/or  assets  as
aforesaid  which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by  operation
of law or otherwise.

           (b)   Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This  Agreement  shall  be
binding   upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  you  (and  your  personal
representatives  and  heirs)  and the Company and  any  organization  which
succeeds  to  substantially all of the business or assets of  the  Company,
whether  by  means  of  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of   all   or
substantially  all  of  the assets of the Company or otherwise,  including,
without  limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by operation  of
law.   This  Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by
your   personal   or  legal  representatives,  executors,   administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you should  die
while  any  amount  would  still be payable to you  hereunder  if  you  had
continued  to  live,  all such amounts, unless otherwise  provided  herein,
shall  be  paid  in  accordance with the terms of this  Agreement  to  your
devisee,  legatee  or other designee or, if there is no such  designee,  to
your estate.

           8.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

           "Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such  firm  is
unable  or  unwilling  to perform such calculations,  such  other  national
accounting  firm as shall be designated by agreement between  you  and  the
Company.   To  the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting  firm
shall  be designated to perform the calculations in respect of the Combined
Arrangements.

           "Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in the
applicable  Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity  Plan,
the Board.

           "Cause"  shall mean a termination of your employment during  the
Term  which  is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii)  your  willful
disclosure  of  material  trade  secrets  or  other  material  confidential
information related to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries  or
(iii)  your  willful and continued failure substantially  to  perform  your
duties  with the Company (other than any such failure resulting  from  your
incapacity  due  to  physical  or mental illness  or  any  such  actual  or
anticipated  failure resulting from a resignation by you for  Good  Reason)
after  a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you  by
the  Board,  which demand specifically identifies the manner in  which  the
Board  believes that you have not substantially performed your duties,  and
which  performance is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days  of
receipt of such demand.   For purposes of the previous sentence, no act  or
failure  to  act  on your part shall be deemed "willful"  unless  done,  or
omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable  belief
that  your  action  or omission was in the best interest  of  the  Company.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, you shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  been
terminated  for Cause unless and until there shall have been  delivered  to
you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
than  three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of  the  Board  at  a
meeting  of  the  Board called and held for such purpose (after  reasonable
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be
heard  before  the Board), finding that in the good faith  opinion  of  the
Board  you  were guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i),  (ii)  or
(iii)  of the first sentence of this section and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.

            "Change  in  Control" shall mean a change  in  control  of  the
Company  of  a nature that would be required to be reported in response  to
Item  6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange
Act,  whether  or  not  the  Company is  then  subject  to  such  reporting
requirement;  provided, however, that, anything in this  Agreement  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, a Change in Control  shall  be  deemed  to  have
occurred if:

                                       29
<PAGE>
     
          (i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust,  unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or  any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Exchange Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3  of  the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange  Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing  30%
     or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
     securities  entitled  to  vote in the election  of  directors  of  the
     Company;
     
           (ii)  during  any  period  of  two (2)  consecutive  years  (not
     including  any  period  prior  to the  execution  of  this  Agreement)
     individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the  Board
     and  any new directors, whose election by the Board or nomination  for
     election  by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote  of  at
     least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then still in office who
     either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election
     or  nomination for election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent
     Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof;
     
          (iii)     There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
     other  corporate  transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),
     in  each  case, with respect to which the stockholders of the  Company
     immediately  prior to such Transaction do not, immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power  of
     the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
     
           (iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company  are
     sold, liquidated or distributed; or
     
           (v)   there  is a "change in control" of the Company within  the

executes  an  agreement,  the consummation of which  would  result  in  the
occurrence  of  a  Change in Control, (iii) the date the Board  approves  a
transaction  or  series of transactions, the consummation  of  which  would
result  in  a  Change  in Control and (iv) the date the  Company  fails  to
satisfy its obligations to have this agreement assumed by any successor  to
the  Company  in  accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.   If  the
Change  in  Control  Date occurs as a result of an agreement  described  in
clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of  the
Board described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the Change  in
Control  to  which  such agreement or approval relates  (the  "Contemplated
Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then the Term shall expire
on  the  sixtieth  day  (the "Reset Date") following  the  date  the  Board
certifies  by  resolution  duly adopted by three-fourths  (3/4ths)  of  the
Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in  Control
is  not  reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this  sentence
shall  not apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment  with
the Company has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on  or
prior  to  the  Reset  Date  or  (B)  the Contemplated  Change  in  Control
subsequently  occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following  the
Reset  Date, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and  a
new  Term  shall  commence upon the occurrence of a  subsequent  Change  in
Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, if  your
employment with the Company terminates prior to the Change in Control  Date
and  it is reasonably demonstrated that your termination of employment  (i)
was  at  the  request  of  the third party who has taken  steps  reasonably
calculated  to  effect  the Change in Control or (ii)  otherwise  arose  in
connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, then Change in
Control  Date  shall mean the date immediately prior to the  date  of  your
termination of employment.

Price"  as  defined  in the applicable Equity Plan and  determined  by  the

Equity Plan to determine such price as of such date.

Agreements  entered into as of the date first set forth above  between  the
Company  and  certain  of its executive officers, any  Retention  Agreement

Severance Plan.

           "Combined Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash amount of  (i)
severance payments made to you under Section 3(a) of this Agreement  or  to
any other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of
the  applicable  Combined Arrangement, (ii) severance payments  made  under
Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of

under  Section  6  of  this Agreement or to any other  employee  or  former
employee  under  the  corresponding provisions of the  applicable  Combined
Arrangement,  (iv)  fees and expenses which are paid or reimbursed  to  you
under  Section  6  of  this Agreement or to any other  employee  or  former
employee  under  the  corresponding provisions of the  applicable  Combined

to any other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions
of  the  applicable  Combined Arrangement and (vi) costs  incurred  by  the
Company in respect of any employee or former employee under Section 2(d) of
the  Supplement or the corresponding provisions of the applicable  Combined

your  failure  to return to full-time performance of your  duties  for  the
Company within thirty (30) days after written Notice of Termination due  to
Disability  is  given  to you.  Any question as to the  existence  of  your
Disability  upon which you and the Company cannot agree shall be determined
by a qualified independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable
to make such selection, such selection shall be made by any adult member of
your immediate family), and approved by the Company.  The determination  of
such physician made in writing to the Company and to you shall be final and
conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.

           "ELTSOP" shall mean the Apple Computer, Inc. 1987 Executive Long

     immediately prior to the Change in Control Date;
     
           (ii) A reduction by the Company in your annual base salary as in

     substitute  or  alternative plan) has been made with respect  to  such
     plan  in connection with the Change in Control, or the failure by  the
     Company  to  continue  your  participation  therein  on  at  least  as
     favorable  a  basis, both in terms of the amount of benefits  provided
     and the level of your participation relative to other participants, as
     existed on the Change in Control Date;
     
           (v)   The failure by the Company to continue to provide you with
     benefits  at least as favorable in the aggregate to those  enjoyed  by
     you  under  the  Company's pension, savings, life insurance,  medical,

     business;

provided, however, that an event described above in clause (i), (ii), (iv),

you  to  the  Company in writing and is not corrected by the Company  in  a
manner  which is reasonably satisfactory to you (including full retroactive

Company's receipt of such written notice from you.

               Stock  of  the  Company immediately prior to the  Change  in
               Control Date; and
          
          C    equals  the greater of (i) (A) if the Common Stock is listed
               on  any established stock exchange or national market system
               (including,  without limitation, the National Market  System

EXHIBIT 10.A.22

June 9, 1995
Mr. Michael H. Spindler
1 Infinite Loop
Cupertino, California 95014

Retention Agreement


Dear Mr. Spindler:

		Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation  
(the "Company"), considers it essential to the best interests of its 
stockholders to take reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  
Further, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that
the uncertainty and questions which might arise among management in the 
context of a change in control of the Company could result in the departure 
or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its
stockholders.

		The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps 
should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and 
dedication of members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, 
including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face 
of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in 
control of the Company.

		In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company,
the Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement 
(this "Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment 
in the event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which
are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such 
words in Section 8 of this Agreement.

		1.	Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of 
your employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control
Date and shall continue until the third anniversary of the Change in Control 
Date (the "Term").
		2.	Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the 
following terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the 
Company:

		(a)	Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles,
nature and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no
less favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the 
Change in Control Date.

		(b)	Salary and Bonus.  Your base salary and annual bonus 
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically 
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to 
other senior executives of the Company.

		(c)	Incentive Compensation.  You shall be eligible to 
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by 
the Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms and 
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the 
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.

		(d)	Benefits.  You shall be eligible to participate in 
all pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the 
Company provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of 
such plans and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, 
in the aggregate, than the terms and provisions available to other executive 
employees of the Company.
		
                (e)	Location.  You will continue to be employed at the 
business location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control 
Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel for business 
purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the amount 
of business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date. 


                                  35
<PAGE>

		3.	Involuntary Termination During the Term.  

		(a)	Severance Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the 
date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but unpaid
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time
of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis 
of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have 
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you 
within 5 days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual 
bonus for the year in which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated 
on the basis of your target bonus for that year and on the assumption that 
all performance targets have been or will be achieved.  In addition, the 
Company shall pay you in a cash lump sum, within 8 days following the date 
of your execution of the release described in the last sentence of this 
Section 3(a) (or the Date of Termination, if later), an amount (the 
"Severance Payment") equal to three times the sum of your Reference Salary 
and your Reference Bonus.  The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any 
other severance payments which you are entitled to receive under any other 
severance pay plan or arrangement sponsored by the Company and its 
subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance Payment shall be conditioned 
upon your execution of a release in favor of the Company in substantially 
the form of the release required for the receipt of severance payments
under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) which 
is not revoked by you within the seven-day revocation period specified 
therein.

		(b)	Benefit Payment.  In the event of your Involuntary 
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible 
dependents shall continue to be eligible to participate during the Benefit 
Continuation Period (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, 
dental, health, life and other fringe benefit plans and arrangements 
applicable to you immediately prior to your Involuntary 
Termination on the same terms and conditions in effect for you and your 
dependents immediately prior to such Involuntary 
Termination.  For purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation 
Period" means the period beginning on the Date of 
Termination and ending on the earlier to occur of (i) the third anniversary 
of the Date of Termination and (ii) the date that you and 
your dependents are eligible and elect coverage under the plans of a 
subsequent employer which provide substantially equivalent or 
greater benefits to you and your dependents.
	
		(c)	Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination of 
your employment by the Company or by you during 
the Term shall be communicated by a notice of termination to the other 
party hereto (the "Notice of Termination").  The Notice of 
Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in this 
Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the 
facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your 
employment under the provision so indicated.  The date of 
your termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (the 
"Date of Termination") shall be determined as follows:  (i) 
if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after a 
Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not 
have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such thirty 
(30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by 
the Company in an Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the 
Notice of Termination is received by you and (iii) if your 
employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, the later of the date 
specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10) days 
following the date such notice is received by you.  If the basis for your 
Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, 
the Date of Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your Notice 
of Termination is received by the Company.   The Date of 
Termination for a resignation of employment other than for Good Reason 
shall be the date set forth in the applicable notice, which 
shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date such notice is 
received by the Company.		
		
		(d)	No Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not be required 
to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in 
this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the 
amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this 
Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as the result of 
employment by another employer or by pension benefits 
paid by the Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or 
otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii) of 
the last sentence of Section 3(b).

		4.	Additional Payment.  

		(a)	Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein 
to the contrary, if it is determined that any Payment 
would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or 
any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax 
(such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is 
herein referred to as an "Excise Tax"), then you shall be entitled to 
an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will place 
you in the same after-tax economic position that you 
would have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had not applied to the Payment.  The 
amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined by 
the Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula
{(E x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting Firm 
deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same 
result), where
	E	equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess parachute 
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code;



                                 36
<PAGE>

	M	equals the sum of the highest marginal rates1 for Taxes 
applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and


        T	equals M plus the rate of Excise Tax applicable to the 
Payment.

No Gross-Up Payments shall be payable hereunder if the Accounting Firm 
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

 		(b)	Determination of Gross-Up Payment.  Subject to the 
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required 
under this Section 4, including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the 
amount of the Payments constituting excess parachute 
payments, and the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the 
Accounting Firm, which shall provide detailed supporting 
calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen days of the Change 
in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any other 
date reasonably requested by you or the Company on which a determination 
under this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  The 
Company shall pay to you the initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the 
receipt by you and the Company of the Accounting 
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax 
is payable by you, the Company shall cause the 
Accounting Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm has 
substantial authority under the Code and Regulations 
not to report an Excise Tax on your federal income tax return.  Any 
determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon you 
and the Company.  If the initial Gross-Up Payment is insufficient to cover 
the amount of the Excise Tax that is ultimately determined 
to be owing by you with respect to any Payment (hereinafter an 
"Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies under 
Section 4(c) below, shall promptly pay to you an additional Gross-Up 
Payment in respect of the Underpayment.

		(c)	Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in 
writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if 
successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  
Such notice shall be given as soon as practicable 
after you know of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature of 
the claim and the date on which the claim is requested to 
be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration of the 
thirty-day period following the date on which you notify the 
Company, or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with respect 
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the 
Company notifies you in writing prior to the expiration of the Notice 
Period that it desires to contest the claim, you shall:  (i) give the 
Company any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to the 
claim; (ii) take such action in connection with the 
claim as the Company may reasonably request, including, without limitation, 
accepting legal representation with respect to such claim 
by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable 
to you; (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith 
in contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any 
proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the 
Company to control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, 
permit the Company to pursue or forgo any and all 
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the 
taxing authority in respect of such claim.  If requested by the 
Company, you agree either to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or 
contest the claim in any permissible manner and to prosecute 
such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a 
court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts 
as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that, if the Company 
directs you to pay such claim and pursue a refund, the 
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to you on an after-tax and 
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's 
control of the contest related to the claim shall be limited to the issues 
related to the Gross-Up Payment and you shall be entitled to 
settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issues raised by the 
Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority.  If the Company 
does not notify you in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period of its 
desire to contest the claim, the Company shall pay to you an 
additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of the excess parachute payments 
that are the subject of the claim, and you agree to pay the 
amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the claim to the applicable 
taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

		(d)	Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an Advance, 
you become entitled to a refund with respect to the 
claim to which such Advance relates, you shall pay the Company the amount 
of the refund (together with any interest paid or credited 
thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If, after receipt by you of an 
Advance, a determination is made that you shall not be entitled to 
any refund with respect to the claim and the Company does not promptly 
notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund, then 
the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid by you and the 
amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional 
Gross-Up Payment then owing to you.  

		(e)	Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify 
you and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from 
any costs, expenses, penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities 
("Losses") incurred by you with respect to the exercise by the 
Company of any of its rights under this Section 4, including, without 
limitation, any Losses related to the Company's decision to 

                               37

federal, state and local marginal rate of 56% would be 
expressed as .560.
<PAGE>

contest a claim or any imputed income to you resulting from any Advance or 
action taken on your behalf by the Company hereunder.  
The Company shall pay all legal fees and expenses incurred under this 
Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable 
expenses incurred by you in connection with any actions taken by the 
Company or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The 
Company shall also pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, 
including, without limitation, the fees and expenses 
related to the opinion referred to in Section 4(b).

		(f)	Combined Payments.  Anything in this Section 4 to 
the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have 
no obligation to pay you a required Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 
if the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments has at 
the time such payment is due exceeded the Limit.  If the amount of a Gross-Up
Payment to you under this Section 4 would result in 
the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit, the Company shall pay you only 
the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which can 
be paid to you without causing the aggregate amount of all Combined Payments
to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled 
to a Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or former 
employees of the Company are also entitled to gross-up 
payments under the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined 
Arrangements and the aggregate amount of all such 
payments would cause the Limit on Combined Payments to be exceeded, the 
Company shall allocate the amount of the reduction 
necessary to comply with the Limit among all such payments in the proportion
that the amount of each such gross-up payment bears to 
the aggregate amount of all such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) 
shall require you to repay to the Company any amount that 
was previously paid to you under this Section 4.

		5.	Other Provisions.  

		(a)	Vesting and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted to 
you under the Equity Plans (including Short-Term 
Awards) shall vest and become exercisable in the event of your Involuntary 
Termination on or following the Change in Control Date. 
If you are employed by the Company on the date of the Equity Plan Change in 
Control, your Equity Awards will vest and become 
exercisable as of such date.

		(b)	Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with 
the terms of the Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan 
Change in Control, Equity Awards which are options or stock appreciation 
rights are "cashed out," unless the Administrator in its 
discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that the Administrator 
elects not to cash out such Equity Awards, the Administrator 
has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of all or 
substantially all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such 
Equity Awards to be assumed or an equivalent option or stock appreciation 
right granted by the successor corporation to the Company 
or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, or (ii) to provide 
that your Equity Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-
day period beginning on the date that you are so notified of such action by 
the Administrator and that such Equity Awards will expire 
to the extent not exercised at the end of such thirty-day period (the 
"30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator determines to utilize 
the 30-Day Alternative, the Company shall pay you with respect to each such 
Equity Award the excess, if any (the "Additional 
Amount"), of the Change in Control Price you would have received had the 
Equity Award been cashed out on the date of the Equity 
Plan Change in Control over the value of the consideration actually 
received by you in settlement of such awards (determined as of the 
date such consideration is received by you).  Further, in the event of your 
Involuntary Termination on or after the Change in Control 
Date but on or prior to the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control, the 
Company shall pay you the Additional Amount as if your 
employment had continued through the date of the Equity Plan Change in 
Control.  In either case, the payment of the Additional 
Amount shall be made within 5 days following the determination by the 
Administrator of the Change in Control Price.

		(c)	Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the 
transaction resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control 
occurs at such a time or is structured in such a manner so as to make it 
reasonably likely that you would be subject to actual or 
potential liability for short-swing profits under Section 16 of the 
Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability") if you were to 
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through a merger) of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, such 
transaction and (ii) your inability to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise 
dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the date of 
such Equity Plan Change in Control eliminates or reduces the value of some 
or all of your Short-Term Awards, then, on the date of the 
Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company shall pay you in a cash lump sum 
the amount of $0.  The provisions of clause (ii) of the 
previous sentence shall be deemed to apply where (a) you are precluded from 
exercising, tendering or otherwise disposing of your 
Short-Term Awards on or prior to the Transaction Date in order to avoid 
Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b) a Short-Term Award cannot 
be repurchased, exchanged or cashed-out by the Company (or other person) on 
or prior to the Transaction Date without a risk of Short-
Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are required to delay the 
exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term 
Awards in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability and such delay 
results in your receiving consideration for your Short-Term 
Awards (valued at the date such consideration is received) which is of 
lesser value than the consideration you would have received 
(valued as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in Control) for such 
awards had such delay not occurred.  The foregoing provisions 
shall apply to your Equity Awards notwithstanding your Involuntary 
Termination of employment with the Company on or after the 
Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control.  
The provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if (A) prior 
to the Equity Plan Change in Control, the Company provides you at its 
expense with an opinion from a nationally recognized firm of 
attorneys stating that the exercise, tender, sale or other disposition of 
your Short-Term Awards as part of, or prior to, the transaction 
resulting in the Equity Plan Change in Control will not subject you to 
Short-Swing Profit Liability and (B) following your receipt of 

       				38
<PAGE>

such opinion there is sufficient time for you to exercise, tender, sell or 
otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the 
Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing the value thereof.   

		(d)	General.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
 notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and 
exercisability provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity 
Awards be less favorable to you then the terms and 
provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof. 			

		6.	Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or 
reimburse you on an after-tax basis for all costs and 
expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable legal 
fees and expenses which reflect common practice with 
respect to the matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any claim, 
action or proceeding (i) arising out of your termination of 
employment during the Term, (ii) contesting, disputing or enforcing any 
right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or (iii) 
arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability 
of this Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however, 
that the amount of the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 
shall not exceed $2 million.

		7.	Successors; Binding Agreement.

		(a) 	Assumption by Successor. The Company will require 
any successor (whether direct or indirect, by 
purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all 
of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume 
and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same 
extent that the Company would be required to perform it 
if no such succession had taken place; provided, however, that no such 
assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations 
hereunder.  As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company 
as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its 
business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform 
this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

		(b)	Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This Agreement 
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and 
your personal representatives and heirs) and the Company and any 
organization which succeeds to substantially all of the business or 
assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, consolidation, 
acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company 
or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in 
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to 
the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, 
executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, 
devisees and legatees.  If you should die while any amount would still be 
payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all 
such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance 
with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee 
or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.

		8.	Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the 
following capitalized words shall have the meanings set 
forth below:

		"Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such firm 
is unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, 
such other national accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement 
between you and the Company.  To the extent reasonably 
practicable, one such accounting firm shall be designated to perform the 
calculations in respect of the Combined Arrangements.

		"Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined 
in the applicable Equity Plan or, if no such term is 
defined in the Equity Plan, the Board.

		"Cause" shall mean a termination of your employment during 
the Term which is a result of (i) your felony 
conviction, (ii) your willful disclosure of material trade secrets or other 
material confidential information related to the business of the 
Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your willful and continued failure 
substantially to perform your duties with the Company (other 
than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or 
mental illness or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting 
from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a written demand for 
substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, 
which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes 
that you have not substantially performed your duties, 
and which performance is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days 
of receipt of such demand.   For purposes of the previous 
sentence, no act or failure to act on your part shall be deemed "willful" 
unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith 
and without reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best 
interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
you shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until 
there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a 
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than 
three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a 
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable 
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your 
counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith 
opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct set forth above 
in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this section and 
specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

		 "Change in Control" shall mean a change in control of the 
Company of a nature that would be required to be 
reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A 
promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or not the 
Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided, however, 
that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 

				39
<PAGE>

notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:

	(i)	any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, 
trust, unincorporated organization or other entity 
or person, or any syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 
14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act, is or becomes the 
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and 
Regulations under the Exchange Act), directly or 
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the 
combined voting power of the Company's then 
outstanding securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the 
Company;

	(ii)	during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not 
including any period prior to the execution of this 
Agreement) individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the 
Board and any new directors, whose election by 
the Board or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was 
approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) 
of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the 
beginning of the period or whose election or nomination 
for election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent Directors"), cease 
for any reason to constitute a majority thereof; 

	(iii)	There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or 
other corporate transaction involving the Company 
(a "Transaction"), in each case, with respect to which the stockholders of 
the Company immediately prior to such Transaction 
do not, immediately after the Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the 
combined voting power of the Company or other 
corporation resulting from such Transaction;

	(iv)	all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are

meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the 
Regulations.

		"Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the 
date on which the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date 
on which the Company executes an agreement, the consummation of which would 
result in the occurrence of a Change in Control, (iii) 
the date the Board approves a transaction or series of transactions, the 
consummation of which would result in a Change in Control 
and (iv) the date the Company fails to satisfy its obligations to have this 
agreement assumed by any successor to the Company in 
accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.  If the Change in Control 
Date occurs as a result of an agreement described in clause 
(ii) of the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of the Board 
described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the 
Change in Control to which such agreement or approval relates (the 
"Contemplated Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, 
then the Term shall expire on the sixtieth day (the "Reset Date") following 
the date the Board certifies by resolution duly adopted by 
three-fourths (3/4ths) of the Incumbent Directors then in office that the 
Contemplated Change in Control is not reasonably likely to 
occur; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply if (A) an 
Involuntary Termination of your employment with the Company 
has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on or prior to the 
Reset Date or (B) the Contemplated Change in Control 
subsequently occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following the 
Reset Date, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain 
in effect and a new Term shall commence upon the occurrence of a subsequent 

Change in Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first 
sentence of this section, if your employment with the Company terminates 
prior to the Change in Control Date and it is reasonably 
demonstrated that your termination of employment (i) was at the request of 
the third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated 
to effect the Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with 
or in anticipation of the Change in Control, then Change in 
Control Date shall mean the date immediately prior to the date of your 
termination of employment.

		"Change in Control Price" shall mean the "Change in Control 
Price" as defined in the applicable Equity Plan and 
determined by the Administrator as of the date of the Equity Plan Change in

such date.

		"Combined Arrangements" shall mean this Agreement, the 
Retention Agreements entered into as of the date first set 
forth above between the Company and certain of its executive officers, any 
Retention Agreement entered into after the date hereof 
which is specifically designated by the terms thereof as one of the 
Combined Arrangements and the Supplement to the Severance Plan.

		"Combined Payments" shall mean the aggregate cash amount of 
(i) severance payments made to you under Section 
3(a) of this Agreement or to any other employee or former employee under 
the corresponding provisions of the applicable Combined 
Arrangement, (ii) severance payments made under Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of 
the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-Up Payments made to you under 
Section 6 of this Agreement or to any other employee 
or former employee under the corresponding provisions of the applicable 
Combined Arrangement, (iv) fees and expenses which are 
paid or reimbursed to you under Section 6 of this Agreement or to any other 
employee or former employee under the corresponding 
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangement, (v) payments made to you 
under Section 5 of this Agreement or to any other 
employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of the 
applicable Combined Arrangement and (vi) costs incurred by

the applicable Combined Arrangement.

written Notice of Termination due to Disability is given to 
you.  Any question as to the existence of your Disability upon which you 
and the Company cannot agree shall be determined by a 
qualified independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable to 
make such selection, such selection shall be made by any 
adult member of your immediate family), and approved by the Company.  The
