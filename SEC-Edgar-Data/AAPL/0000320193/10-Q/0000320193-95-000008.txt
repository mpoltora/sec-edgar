             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results have been included.  All adjustments are  of  a  normal
   recurring nature unless specified in a separate note included  in  these
   Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The results  for  interim
   periods  are  not necessarily indicative of results to be  expected  for
   the  entire year.  These financial statements and notes should  be  read
   in   conjunction  with  the  Company's  annual  consolidated   financial
   statements  and  the notes thereto for the fiscal year  ended  September
   30,  1994, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   September 30, 1994 (the "1994 Form 10-K").

2. In  the first quarter of 1995, the Company lowered its estimates of  the
   total  remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan  initiated
   in  the  third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased
   income  by  $17 million ($11 million, or $0.09 per share, after  taxes).
   This  adjustment primarily reflected favorable cancellation  settlements
   of   certain  R&D  project  commitments  and  facility  leases  and  the
   completion of other actions at lower costs than originally estimated.

   At  March 31, 1995, the Company had $26 million of accrued restructuring
   costs  for  actions  that  are currently under way.   Approximately  $20
   million  in  charges to the accrual are expected to be  incurred  during
   1995 with the remaining $6 million incurred beyond 1995.  Charges to  be
   incurred  beyond  1995  relate  primarily to  recurring  payments  under
   certain noncancelable operating leases.

   The  following  table  depicts  a  roll-forward  reconciliation  of  the
   activity  in the restructuring accrual balance from September  30,  1994
   to March 31, 1995:

4. Effective October 1, 1994, the Company adopted Financial  Accounting
   Standard No. 115 (FAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in  Debt
   and  Equity  Securities".   In accordance with  FAS  115,  prior  period
   financial  statements have not been restated to reflect  the  change  in
   accounting  principle.   The cumulative effect of  the  change  was  not
   material to shareholders' equity as of October 1, 1994.  Under FAS  115,
   debt  securities that a company has both the positive intent and ability
   to  hold  to  maturity are carried at amortized cost.   Debt  securities
   that a company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold  to
   maturity  and all marketable equity securities are classified as  either
   available-for-sale   or  trading  and  are  carried   at   fair   value.
   Generally,  unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified
   as  available-for-sale  are  reported as a  component  of  shareholders'
   equity.   Unrealized  holding gains and losses on securities  classified
   as trading are included in earnings.

   The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily of  certificates  of
   deposit,  time  deposits and commercial paper with maturities  of  three
   months  or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term investments consist
   principally  of  commercial  paper with  maturities  between  three  and
   twelve  months.  The Company's marketable equity securities  consist  of
   securities  issued  by  U. S. corporations and are  included  in  "Other
   assets"  on the accompanying balance sheet.  As of March 31, 1995,   the
   Company's   cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  marketable
   equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.

   The  adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding
   gains  (losses)  on available-for-sale cash equivalents and  short  term
   investments  were not material either individually or in the  aggregate,
   at  March 31, 1995.  The net adjustment recorded to shareholders' equity
   for  unrealized  holding  gains (losses) related  to  marketable  equity
   securities was an unrealized gain of approximately $40 million at  March
   31, 1995.  The realized gains (losses) recorded to earnings on sales  of
   available-for-sale securities, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   were not material for the three and six months ended March 31, 1995.

5. U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $372
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested   in  operations  outside  the  United  States.   It   is   not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely  invested earnings, the Company provides  for  federal  and
   state  income  taxes  currently  on undistributed  earnings  of  foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The   Internal   Revenue  Service  has  proposed  federal   income   tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and the Company  has  made
   prepayments   thereon.    The  Company  has  contested   these   alleged
   deficiencies  and  is  pursuing administrative  and  judicial  remedies.
   Management  believes  that adequate provision  has  been  made  for  any
   adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

6. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options outstanding during the period.

7. Certain prior year amounts on the consolidated statements of cash  flows
   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

8. On  January 25, 1995, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of
   $0.12  per  share  related to the Company's first fiscal  quarter  ended
   December  30, 1994.  The dividend was distributed on March 10, 1995,  to
   shareholders of record as of February 17, 1995.  On April 27,  1995, the
   Board  of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share for  the
   Company's  second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1995.  The dividend  is
   payable on June 23, 1995, to shareholders of record as of June 2, 1995.

Net  sales  for  the second quarter and first six months of 1995  increased
over the comparable periods of 1994, primarily resulting from a combination
of  unit growth and higher average selling prices.  The increase in average
selling  prices  was driven by a shift in mix towards the  Company's  newer
products  and products with multi-media configurations.  Specifically,  the
Company recorded strong sales of its Performa (registered trademark) 630, 
and of products  within the   Power  Macintosh(registered trademark) family
and  PowerBook (registered trademark)  500  series  of  personal
computers.  Increased sales of these products contributed to an increase in
the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh (registered trademark) computer
unit of approximately 10%  and  17%  in  the  second  quarter  and  first  
six  months  of  1995, respectively,  over  the  comparable periods  of  
1994.   Total  Macintosh computer  unit sales increased 21% and 9% in the 
second quarter  and  first six months of 1995, respectively, over the 
comparable periods of 1994. This unit  sales growth principally resulted 
from strong sales of the  Company's Power  Macintosh products, PowerBook 
500 series of personal computers and newer  product  offerings within the 
Performa family  of  desktop  personal computers.  This unit growth was 
partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the Company's 
older product offerings.

International  net sales grew 34% and 26% in the second quarter  and  first
six  months  of  1995, respectively, over the comparable periods  of  1994,
primarily  reflecting  strong  net sales  growth  in  the  Pacific  region,
particularly Japan.  Net sales for the second quarter and first six  months
of  1995  grew  moderately in Europe over the comparable periods  of  1994.
International net sales represented 54% and 51% of total net sales for  the
second  quarter and first six months of 1995, respectively,  compared  with
52%  and  48%,  respectively,   for  the  corresponding  periods  of  1994.
Domestic  net  sales grew 21% and 15% in the second quarter and  first  six
months  of  1995,  respectively,  over  the  comparable  periods  of  1994,
primarily  resulting  from  strong growth in the  education,  consumer  and
business markets.

In  general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an  as-
needed  basis due to the Company's distribution strategy, which is designed
to  expedite  the filling of orders.  Resellers frequently change  delivery
schedules   and  order  rates  depending  on  changing  market  conditions.
Unfilled  orders ("backlog") can be, and often are, canceled at will.   The
Company  attempts  to  fill  orders on the  requested  delivery  schedules.
However, products may be in relatively short supply from time to time until
production  volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet  demand  or  if
other  production or fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's  backlog
increased to  approximately  $795  million  at  May  5,  1995,  from
approximately $670 million at February 3, 1995, primarily due to backlog of
the Company's Power Macintosh products.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time  is  not a meaningful indication of  its  future  business
prospects.   In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  of  or
immediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering
by  dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply  once
dealers  and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.   Because
of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog,
backlog should not
                                        
                                        8

be  considered  a  reliable indicator of the Company's  future  revenue  or
financial performance.  Further information regarding the Company's backlog
may  be  found  under Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q  under  the  heading
"Factors that May Affect Future Results
and  Financial  Condition",  which information is  hereby  incorporated  by
reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and
its  cost  of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the  sale  of
products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for  its
products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based
primarily  on  the cost of components and to a lesser extent, direct  labor
costs.    The   type  and  cost  of  components  included   in   particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and  disk  drives)
is  often directly related to the need to market products in configurations
competitive  with  other producers.  Competition in the  personal  computer
industry is intense, and in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and
product  configuration are often necessary in order to remain  competitive.
Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly
influenced  in  the  short term by actions undertaken  by  the  Company  in
response to industry-wide competitive pressures.

Gross  margin  increased both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during the second quarter and first six months of 1995, respectively,  over
the  comparable  periods  of  1994.  The increase  in  gross  margin  as  a
percentage  of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in  product  mix
towards  the  Company's  newer  high margin products  within  each  product
category which included strong sales of the Company's entry level Macintosh
Performa  630,  and of products within its Power Macintosh family  and  its
PowerBook 500 series of personal computers.

The  increase  in  gross margin levels was affected somewhat  favorably  by
changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a  weaker  U.S.
dollar  relative to certain foreign currencies during both  the  first  and
second  quarters of 1995 compared with the corresponding  periods of  1994.
The  Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes  in
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations  can
be  significantly  affected in the short term by  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency exchange rates.

The  Company's  gross margin percentage declined from 28.7%  in  the  first
quarter of 1995 to 26.2% in the second quarter of 1995, resulting primarily
from   the   Company's   pricing    strategies,    particularly  on   entry
level and PowerBook notebook personal computers, and to a lesser extent  on
Power Macintosh products.  It is anticipated that gross margins will remain
under pressure and could fall below prior years' levels worldwide due to  a
variety  of  factors, including continued industry-wide pricing  pressures,
increased competition, and compressed product life cycles.

Research  and  development expenditures increased in amount in  the  second
quarter of 1995 when compared with the corresponding period of 1994, due to
higher  project-  and headcount- related spending.  During  the  first  six
months  of  1995,  research  and development  expenditures  decreased  when
compared with the corresponding period of 1994, primarily reflecting  lower
product  development expenditures during the first quarter  of  1995  as  a
result  of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs  as
well  as  fewer  new  product introductions in the first  quarter  of  1995
compared with the corresponding period of 1994.

As  a  percentage  of  net  sales, research  and  development  expenditures
decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 1995 compared  with
the  corresponding periods of 1994, primarily due to the  increase  in  the
level of net sales.

Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased in  amount  in  the
second  quarter  and  first  six months of  1995  when  compared  with  the
corresponding  periods of 1994.  This increase was primarily  a  result  of
increased advertising and channel marketing program spending as the Company
continued its efforts to expand its market share.  Despite this increase in
expenditures, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased  as  a
percentage of net sales in the second quarter and first six months of  1995
when compared with the corresponding periods of 1994, primarily as a result
of  the  increase  in  the level of net sales combined with  the  Company's
ongoing efforts to manage operating expense growth.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses relative  to  gross  margin  levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross  margins, and continued competitive pressures worldwide.  The Company
anticipates that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase
in amount during the remaining quarters of 1995, but will remain relatively
flat as a percentage of net sales.

period in 1994.  The increase in expense was primarily driven by net losses
recorded   for  the  mark-to-market  valuation  of  outstanding  currency
forwards  and sold currency options undertaken for currency risk management
purposes, and to a lesser extent, higher overall hedging costs as a  result
of  the  increased volatility in the exchange markets as the value  of  the
U.S.  dollar  declined  dramatically relative to other  foreign  currencies
during  March of 1995.  The increase in expense was slightly offset  by  an
increase in net interest income resulting from higher cash balances coupled
with  higher  investment interest rates.  As of May 1, 1995, the  Company's
net  mark-to-market valuation of outstanding currency forwards  and  sold
currency  options  undertaken for currency risk  management  purposes  has
remained  consistent  with the net mark-to-market valuation  recorded  at
March 31, 1995.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $28
million in expense for the first six months of 1995 when compared with  the
corresponding period of 1994, reflecting the $43 million increase in mark-
to-market losses, and expense related

                                       10
<PAGE>

to  foreign exchange risk management activity during the second quarter  of
1995 as discussed above.  This increase in expense was partially offset  by
a  $15 million increase in interest and other income, net, during the first
quarter  of 1995 when compared with the corresponding period of 1994  which
reflected  increased interest income of $8 million, net gains from  foreign
currency risk management activity, and a decrease in interest expense.

Notional  principal  amounts on certain of the Company's  foreign  exchange
instruments increased significantly compared with the balances at September
30,  1994,  in  accordance  with  the Company's  currency  risk  management
strategies.  Specifically, notional principal amounts on purchased and sold
foreign   exchange   options  not  accounted  for   as   hedges   increased
approximately $4.7 billion and $3.8 billion respectively, compared with the
balances  at September 30. 1994.  The notional principal amounts  for  off-
balance-sheet  instruments provide one measure of  the  transaction  volume
outstanding at a particular point in time, and do not necessarily represent
the  amount  of  the Company's exposure to credit or market risk.  The  net
impact   of  the  mark-to-market  valuation  on  these  foreign  exchange
instruments is discussed in the preceding paragraphs.

Further  information  regarding  the  Company's  foreign  exchange  hedging
programs  may  be  found  in Part I, Item 2 of this  Form  10-Q  under  the
subheading  "Global Market Risks" included under the heading "Factors  that
May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report  on  Form
10-Q is incorporated by reference into this discussion.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on  the Company's ability to successfully develop,  manufacture,
and  market  technologically innovative products in order to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future operating results and financial condition.

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's  ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the  availability of application software for new products,  the  effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and
the manufacturing of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated
demand.  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.

In  1994,  the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of  Macintosh
computers  based  on  a  new PowerPC family of RISC  microprocessors.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition may  be  adversely
affected  if  it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its
lines  of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series  of
microprocessors  to  the  PowerPC (registered trademark) microprocessor.
The  success  of  this ongoing transition will depend on the Company's 
ability to continue to sell products  based  on  the  Motorola 68000 series
of  microprocessors  while gaining  market acceptance of the new PowerPC 
processor-based products, to successfully  manage inventory levels of both
product lines simultaneously, and  to  continue to coordinate the timely 
development and distribution  by independent   software  vendors  of  new
"native"  software applications specifically designed for the PowerPC 
processor-based products.

                                       11

The  rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new
product  is  not necessarily an indication of the future rate of  shipments
for  that  product, which depends on many factors, some of  which  are  not
under  the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to  purchase
new  technology  prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users  ("early
adopters");  purchases  in  satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by  users  who
anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of  other
products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to  the
aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,
such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many users until new technology  is
accepted  as  "proven"  and for which commonly used software  products  are
available;  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they  believe  they
can obtain sufficient supply of product previously in backlog.

Backlog  is  often  volatile after new product  introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned  demand  factors, often increasing sharply  coincident  with
introduction, and then reducing sharply once dealers and customers  believe
they can obtain sufficient supply of product.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability  of  European-language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial  demand for the Company's new products  outside  the  United
States,  even though  localized  versions of the  Company's  products  may
be available.

Competition

The  personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues  to  be
characterized  by  consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,
aggressive pricing practices, and downward pressure on gross margins.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected  should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact  of
industry-wide  pricing  pressures. 

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected   by   the  Company's  ability  to  offer  customers   competitive
technologies while effectively managing the impact on inventory levels  and
the potential for customer confusion created by product proliferation.

On  November  7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with  International
Business  Machines Corporation (IBM) and Motorola, Inc. on a  new  hardware
reference  platform  for the PowerPC microprocessor  that  is  intended  to
deliver a much wider range of operating system and application choices  for
computer customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company intends  to
make  the  Macintosh  operating system available on  the  common  platform.
Accordingly,    the  Company's  future  operating  results  and   financial
condition  may  be  affected by its ability to implement this  and  certain
other  collaboration agreements entered into, and to manage the  associated
competitive risk.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by the Company's ability to increase market share in its personal
computer  business.  The Company recently announced the  licensing  of  the
Macintosh operating system to other personal computer vendors in January of
1995,  and  one  vendor  is currently selling product  which  utilizes  the
Macintosh operating system.  However, the Company is currently the  primary
maker  of hardware that uses the Macintosh operating system, and it  has  a
minority  market share in the personal computer market, which is  dominated
by  makers  of  computers  that  run the  MS-DOS(registered trademark)  
and  Microsoft  Windows (trademark) operating systems.  Certain of the 
Company's personal computer products are capable  of running application 
software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating   systems,  through
software  emulation  of  Intel   Corporation microprocessor  chips  by  use 
of software specifically  designed  for  the Company's  products,  either 
those based on the Motorola  68000  series  of microprocessors or those 
based on the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  Company also recently introduced 
products which include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601 microprocessor and 
the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor which enable users  to switch between 
Macintosh and DOS computing environments.  In addition, as a result of the 
collaboration agreement noted in the preceding paragraph, the Company  
believes it may have the opportunity to increase its market  share
in the personal computer business as the Macintosh operating system becomes
available on computers based on the new hardware reference platform.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often
                                        
                                       12
<PAGE>

based   on   the  availability  of  third-party  software  for   particular
applications.   The Company believes that the availability  of  third-party
application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on
the  third-party  developers'  perception  and  analysis  of  the  relative
benefits  of  developing  such software for the Company's  products  versus
software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is  based
on factors such as the relative market share of the Company's products, the
anticipated  potential  revenue  that may  be  earned,  and  the  costs  of
developing such software products.

In  an  effort to increase overall market share, the Company has  commenced
licensing  the  Macintosh  operating  system  to  other  personal  computer
vendors.  The Company anticipates that the licensing activities will result
in  a  variety of these vendors bringing to market personal computers  that
will run application software based on the Macintosh operating system.  The
Company  also  believes  that  licensing the operating  system  will  offer
software  vendors a broader installed base on which they  can  develop  and
provide  technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  However,  there
can  be  no  assurance on the number of application software titles or the
rate at which  vendors  will bring  to  market  application software based
on  the  Macintosh  operating system.  The Company's efforts to increase 
its overall market share through licensing  of  the  Macintosh operating 
system is  also  dependent  on  the Company's  ability to manage the risks
associated with competing  companies producing  Macintosh OS-based computer
systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company cannot  determine  the  ultimate 
effect that  licensing  of  the  Macintosh operating system will have on
its sales or results of operations.

Microsoft  Corporation is the developer of the MS-DOS and Windows operating
systems,  which  are  the  principal competing  operating  systems  to  the
Company's  Macintosh  operating system.  Microsoft  is  also  an  important
developer of application software for the Company's products.  Accordingly,
Microsoft's  interest in producing application software for  the  Company's
products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as an
operating system vendor.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
new  PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors which produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by  most personal computers  using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows  operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based  on  the
Intel microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also
the  developer  of  OS/2,  a competing operating system  to  the  Company's
Macintosh  operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying  the
Company  with  improved  versions  of  microprocessors  for  the  Company's
products  may  be  influenced by IBM's perception of  its  interests  as  a
competing  manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing  operating
system vendor.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by  the  Company's   ability  to  successfully  expand  its   new
businesses  and product offerings into other markets, such as  the  markets
for on-line services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.

Global Market Risks

A  large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international
operations.   As  a result, the Company's operations and financial  results
could  be significantly affected by international factors, such as  changes
in  foreign  currency  exchange rates or weak economic  conditions  in  the
foreign  markets in which the Company distributes its products.   When  the
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value  of
non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens,  the
U.S.    dollar   value   of   non-U.S.   dollar-based   sales    increases.
Correspondingly,  the  U.S.  dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based  costs
increases  when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S.  dollar
strengthens.   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of  currencies  other
than  the  U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar  and  is
adversely  affected  by  a  stronger dollar relative  to  major  currencies
worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may  negatively  affect
the  Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed  in  U.S.
dollars).

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on
the   Company's  non-U.S.  dollar-based  sales,  product  procurement,  and
operating  expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based
exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange  forward
and  option  contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.   Currently,
hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The
Company  also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge  certain
other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,
but  not  firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.   To
reduce  the  costs  associated with these ongoing foreign exchange  hedging
programs,  the  Company  also  regularly  sells  foreign  exchange   option
contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All
foreign exchange
                                        
                                       13
<PAGE>

forward  and  option contracts not accounted for as hedges,  including  all
transactions  intended to reduce the costs associated  with  the  Company's
foreign  exchange  hedging programs, are carried  at  fair  value  and  are
adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.

While  the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the  interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's  leading  industrialized  countries,  the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations  in
the  general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S.
interest  rates  affect  the interest earned on the  Company's  cash,  cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments as well as interest  paid  on  its
short-term  borrowings  and  long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into  interest
rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps are intended  to
better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash,  cash
equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest  rate
swap,  swaption, and option transactions in order to extend  the  effective
duration  of  a  portion  of  its  cash, cash  equivalent,  and  short-term
investment portfolios. These swaps may extend the Company's cash investment
horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.

To  ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange
and  interest  rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor  the  risks  and
opportunities of the non hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors
its  foreign  exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate
swap,  swaption,  and  option  positions on  a  stand-alone  basis  and  in
conjunction  with  its  underlying foreign  currency-  and  interest  rate-
related  exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and  an  economic
perspective.   However, given the effective horizons of the Company's  risk
management  activities, there can be no assurance that  the  aforementioned
programs  will  offset more than a portion of the adverse financial  impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of  gains
and losses related to  marked-to-market instruments for any given period
may  not  coincide  with  the timing of gains and  losses  related  to  the
underlying  economic  exposures,  and as such,  may  adversely  affect  the
Company's operating results and financial position.

Inventory and Supply

The  Company's  products  include  certain  components,  such  as  specific
microprocessors  manufactured  by  Motorola,  Inc.,  that   are   currently
available   only  from  single  sources.   Any  availability   limitations,
interruptions in supplies, or price increases of these and other components
could  adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.
Continued growth in the personal computer industry may create demand for
certain components that exceeds the present manufacturing capacity of 
component suppliers.  If the Company cannot obtain an adequate supply of 
either custom-made or commonly-used components due to competitive factors
in the personal computer industry, the Company's future operating results
and financial condition may be adversely affected by product constraints 
and increased costs.  The Company's  future  operating results and financial
condition may also be adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage
inventory levels  and lead times required to obtain components in order to 
be more responsive to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In 
addition, if anticipated unit  sales  growth for new and current product 
offerings is not  realized, inventory  valuation reserves may be necessary 
that would adversely  affect the Company's results of operations and 
financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution of
the  Company's  products.   Currently,  the  Company's  primary  means   of
distribution  is  through  third-party  computer  resellers.   However,  in
response  to  changing  industry practices and  customer  preferences,  the
Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels, such as
mass-merchandise  stores  (for  example,  Sears  and  Wal-Mart),   consumer
electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business  and
financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of
these sellers weakens or if sellers within consumer channels decide not  to
continue to distribute the Company's products.

Other Factors

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

The Company plans to replace its current transaction systems (which include
order  management, distribution, manufacturing, and finance) with a  single
integrated  system  as  part of its ongoing effort to increase  operational
efficiency.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition
could  be  adversely affected by its ability to implement  and  effectively
manage the transition to this new integrated system.


                                       14
<PAGE>

In April 1995, the Company announced a company-wide reorganization designed
to  more  closely  align the Company's organizational  structure  with  the
Company's  business strategy of placing increased focus on  customer  needs
and  expanding  its presence in the home, education, and business  markets.
Although the Company does not anticipate any downsizing as a result of  the
organizational  changes,  the  Company's  future  operating   results   and
financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected  by  its  ability   to
effectively manage the transition to this new organizational structure.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments, net of short-term borrowings increased  to  $1,359
million  at  March 31, 1995 from $966 million at September 30, 1994.   This
increase  was primarily attributable to the Company's continued efforts  to
increase profit levels and to manage working capital, particularly  in  the
areas of inventory and accounts receivable.

Cash  generated by operations during the first six months of  1995  totaled
$460  million.  Cash was generated primarily by higher sales levels related
to  a  shift in product mix towards higher-margin products which  typically
have higher average selling prices.

Net  cash  used  for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  totaled
approximately  $52  million during the first six  months  of  1995.   These
purchases  primarily included manufacturing machinery and  equipment.   The
Company  anticipates that capital expenditures in 1995 will  be  relatively
consistent with 1994 expenditures of $160 million.

Short-term  borrowings  at March 31, 1995 were approximately  $335  million
higher than at September 30, 1994.  These borrowings were primarily made to
fund  expected  working  capital growth in certain markets  worldwide.   In
general,  the Company's short-term borrowings typically reflect  borrowings
made under its commercial paper program and short-term uncommitted bid-line
arrangements  with certain commercial banks.  In particular,  Apple  Japan,
Inc.,  and  Apple Computer BV, (Netherlands), wholly owned subsidiaries  of
the  Company,  incurred short-term borrowings from several banks,  totaling
approximately  $457  million and $170 million, respectively, at  March  31,
1995.

Long-term  borrowings of $304 million at March 31, 1995 remained consistent
with the balance at September 30, 1994.  Substantially the entire amount of
long-term borrowings represents $300 million aggregate principal amount  of
6.5%  unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration  statement
filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.   This  shelf
registration covers the
registration  of debt and other securities for an aggregate offering  price
of  up  to  $500 million.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of  par,  for  an
effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually
and mature on February 15, 2004.

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short-  and  long-term
borrowings  from  time  to time generally to finance U.S.  working  capital
needs  and  capital  expenditures, because a  substantial  portion  of  the
Company's  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments  is  held  by
foreign   subsidiaries,  generally  in  U.S.  dollar-denominated  holdings.
Amounts  held  by  foreign subsidiaries would be  subject  to  U.S.  income
taxation  upon  repatriation to the United States; the Company's  financial
statements fully provide for

                                       15
<PAGE>

any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984  through 1988, and the Company has  made  prepayments
thereon.   The  Company  has contested these alleged  deficiencies  and  is
pursuing  administrative  and judicial remedies. Management  believes  that
adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments that may result  from
these tax examinations.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.

Reference is made to page 39 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-
K  under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain litigation
involving  Microsoft  Corporation  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  1993
Securities and State Court Shareholders Action Litigation.

In  the  case of Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-
Packard  Company,  the  Company's petition for a writ  of  certiorari   was
denied  by  the  Supreme Court of the United States on February  21,  1995.
Accordingly, the decision of the appellate court affirming the dismissal of
the Company's copyright infringement case against Microsoft Corporation and
Hewlett-Packard is now final.  The remaining outstanding matter in the case
is  Microsoft's  and  Hewlett-Packard's requests  for  an  award  of  their
attorneys'  fees  under the Copyright Act.  The trial court  has  scheduled
preliminary proceedings on these requests, looking toward a hearing in July
1995 to resolve them.

With respect to the 1993 Securities and State Court Shareholders Action
Litigation, the Company announced on May 9, 1995, that all of the 
complaints filed in those cases have been voluntarily dismissed by the 
plaintiffs.  No payment or consideration of any kind was paid by the
defendants, including the Company.

The Company continues to believe the pending suits cited above in which the
Company  is  a  defendant, to be without merit and  intends  to  vigorously
defend  against these actions.  The Company believes the resolution of  all
of  these  matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition  and  results  of  operations as  reported  in  the  accompanying
financial  statements.  However, depending on the amount and timing  of  an
unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's
future results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected  in
a particular period.

EXHIBIT 10.A.20
                              Separation Agreement

      In  consideration of the mutual agreements set forth below, Ian Diery
("Diery")  and Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") agree to the following  terms
and conditions of this Separation Agreement (the "Agreement"):

      1.    Nature  of  Business.  Apple is in the business  of  designing,
developing,  producing,  selling and marketing  computer  systems,  related
products  and  services.  The business practices of Apple  and  the  market
conditions  in which Apple operates change rapidly and these  changes  have
necessitated    prompt    changes   in   management,    and/or    managers'
responsibilities.  These changes are needed from time to time in  the  high
level management positions such as those for which Diery has been employed.

      2.    Resignation  from  Office.  Employee hereby  resigns  from  his
position as Executive Vice President and General Manager, Personal Computer
Division,  effective as the date of this Agreement.  Diery  hereby  resigns
from all other positions he holds on behalf of Apple, its subsidiaries  and
affiliates,  which  positions are set forth at  Exhibit  A  hereto.   Diery
agrees  to  sign  all  appropriate  documentation  prepared  by  Apple   to
facilitate these resignations.

      3.     Employment Status/Termination.  Subject to paragraph 11 below,
from  the  date  of  this Agreement through October 15, 1995  ("Termination
Date")  or  such earlier date as a result of an event under  paragraph  11,
Diery will continue to devote his best efforts to Apple and will remain  an
employee  of  and fiduciary to Apple reporting to Edward B.  Stead.   Until
Termination  Date,  Diery  shall continue to receive  his  regular  salary,
participate  in  the Apple's FY '95 Senior/Executive Incentive  Bonus  Plan
("Bonus  Plan") and receive medical insurance benefits and agrees  that  he
will  use  his  accrued  vacation and sabbatical before  Termination  Date.
Apple  will designate Diery as a participant in Apple's Executive Severance
Plan  ("Plan")  on  or  about August 15, 1995,  or  such  earlier  date  as
determined  between the parties, and Diery will become eligible to  receive
the appropriate compensation and benefits under that Plan.

     4.   Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination.  Subject to paragraph
11 below, at Termination Date, Apple will pay the following:

           a.   Severance Payments.  Under the Plan, on Termination Date as
defined  above,  Diery is eligible to receive a lump sum severance  payment
equal  to  7  months'  pay  and a proration  of  his  FY  '96  bonus,  less
deductions.   Subject  to paragraph 11 below, Apple will  pay  Diery  eight
hundred  eighty  seven thousand, four hundred eighty-five thousand  dollars
($887,485),   less  deductions,  in  full  satisfaction  of   all   Apple's
obligations under the Plan, Bonus Plan and otherwise.  Diery shall be  paid
on or about Termination Date and such payment constitutes full compensation
under  the  Plan  ,  Bonus Plan and otherwise.  There  shall  be  no  other
payments  to Diery except as stated in this paragraph 4(a) and in paragraph
3 above and the amount of such payments shall be subject to paragraph 11.

          b.   Satisfaction of Repayment Obligations.  At Termination Date,
Diery  shall  have  satisfied any and all repayment  obligations  to  Apple
including  specifically his obligation to satisfy his  promissory  note  to
Apple relating to a down payment loan.  A copy of the promissory note  date
December  6,  1989 is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  Diery and Apple  agree
that the principal and interest due and owing as of October 15, 1995 is two
hundred  sixty-one  thousand, seven hundred ninety dollar  and  seventy-one
cents  ($261,790.71).   If this amount (or adjusted  amount  in  the  event
Diery's  Termination Date is prior to October 15, 1995) remains  unpaid  on
Termination Date, Diery agrees that the entire sum may be withheld from the
amounts otherwise payable to him under this Agreement.

           c.   Stock Options.  The Board or Apple's Stock Option Committee
(the  "Committee") previously granted Diery options to purchase  shares  of
Apple  Common  Stock under Apple's 1981 and 1990 Stock  Option  Plans  (the
"1981  and  1990  Plans") and options to purchase  shares  of  stock  under
Apple's  1987  Executive  Long  Term Stock Option  Plan  ("ELTSOP").   Such
options  shall continue to vest and be exercisable in accordance  with  the
terms  of  the grant agreement issued to Diery with respect to such grants,
and  the  terms  of  the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans  and  the  ELTSOP
administered by the Board or the Committee.








                                       20
<PAGE>


          d.   Receipt of Documentation.  Diery acknowledges that he has
previously  received  from Apple copies of pertinent  portions  of  Apple's
Senior/  Executive  Bonus Program, the 1981 and 1990  Stock  Option  Plans,
Apple's  ELTSOP,  the  Vacation and Holiday Policies, and  Apple's  Benefit
Plans  relating  to  health  care,  life insurance,  accidental  death  and
disability,  short  and  long term disability  and  Savings  Plans.   Diery
understands  and agrees to be bound by the written terms and conditions  of
these  various  plans,  policies or programs, and  agrees  that  Apple  has
reserved  the  right  and  option,  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  change,
interpret,  modify  or  terminate these and all other  plans,  policies  or
programs at any time without Diery's consent.

           e.    No  Other Benefits.  Diery will not be entitled to receive
any other compensation, bonus or benefits provided by, through or on behalf
of  Apple,  its  affiliates or subsidiaries, other than benefits  that  are
vested  as of the date of this Agreement and that are payable in accordance
with  the  terms of any applicable Benefit Plan, or otherwise provided  for
herein.

      5.    Confidentiality.  The terms of this Agreement are confidential.
Neither  Diery nor Apple will at any time disclose to any third  party  the
fact or terms of this Agreement, except as authorized by this agreement  or
as required by law.  Diery may also make such disclosure to his spouse, tax
advisor  or lawyer, all of whom shall be instructed to keep the information
disclosed to them confidential; any disclosure by any such party  shall  be
deemed  a  disclosure by Diery. Apple and Diery shall  not  disparage  each
other  in their communications in response to all inquiries from the press,
public media or any other third parties regarding this Agreement or Diery's
employment termination.

      6.    Trade Secrets, Proprietary and Confidential Information.  Diery
agrees   to   comply  with  Apple's  "Proprietary  Rights  and  Information
Agreement" which is attached hereto as Exhibit C to this Agreement

      In  addition, Diery agrees to continue to abide by the principles and
guidelines  in  Apple's  Global Ethics brochure, the  terms  of  which  are
incorporated herein.

      On  or  before Termination Date, Diery agrees to promptly return  all
proprietary and confidential information, including but not limited to  all
inventions,   discoveries,   improvements,  computer   programs,   designs,
documentation, notes, plans, drawings and copies thereof to Apple.

      Diery  and  Apple  agree that this section regarding  Trade  Secrets,
Proprietary  and Confidential Information shall survive the termination  of
this Agreement.

     7.   Fiduciary Duties/Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation.  Diery further
recognizes  that  Apple's work force constitutes  an  important  and  vital
aspect  of  its  business.  Diery agrees, therefore, that both  during  his
employment with Apple,and  for  a  period of six months following 
Termination Date, he shall  notsolicit, or assist others to become employed
by any firm, company or  other business enterprise.  Diery further 
represents that he has no time prior to this Agreement solicited or 
encouraged any employee to leave Apple.

      Diery  will  retain his fiduciary responsibilities to  Apple  to  the
extent  provided by law.  For six months following Termination Date,  Diery
will  not, without the prior express written consent of Apple, compete with
Apple  by engaging in or assisting others to develop or market products  or
services that are in competition with Apple products or services.   Diery's
agreement  not  to compete is limited to the states of California  and  New
York only.

      Diery  and  Apple  also  agree, that upon a breach  or  violation  or
threatened breach or violation of any confidentiality, trade secrets,  non-
competition or non-solicitation agreement by Diery contained herein, or  if
any  provision of Sections 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement, Apple, in addition
to  all other remedies which might be available to it, shall be entitled as
a   matter  of  right  to  equitable  relief  in  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction, including the right to obtain injunctive relief  or  specific
performance.  Diery and Apple agree that the remedies at law for  any  such
breach  or violation are not fully adequate and that the injuries to  Apple
as a result of the continuation of any breach or violation are incapable of
full  calculation  in  monetary terms and therefore constitute  irreparable
harm.  This paragraph 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.





                                       21
<PAGE>


      8.    Indemnification.   All  rights  of  indemnification  previously
provided by Apple to Diery by Apple's By-Laws and/or by the Indemnification
Agreement  dated October 16, 1989, shall continue in full force and  effect
in  accordance with their terms, following the date of this  Agreement.   A
copy  of Diery's Indemnification Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit  D
to this Agreement.

      9.   Successors.  Apple will require any successor (whether direct or
indirect,  by  purchase,  merger, consolidation or  otherwise)  to  all  or
substantially  all  of  the business and/or assets of  Apple  to  expressly
assume  and agree to perform this Agreement in the manner and to  the  same
extent that Apple would be required to perform it if no such succession had
taken  place.   Failure  of Apple to obtain such assumption  and  agreement
prior  to  the effectiveness of any such succession shall entitle Diery  to
the  benefits listed in paragraph 4 of this Agreement, subject to the terms
and conditions therein.

      10.   Governing  Law.   The  validity,  interpretation,  effect,  and
enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
California without regard to its choice of law principles.

      11.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, and Exhibits A, B, C and D to
this  Agreement,  set forth the entire Agreement and understanding  between
Diery   and  Apple,  and  supersede  any  other  negotiations,  agreements,
understandings,  oral  agreements,  representations  or  past   or   future
practices,  whether  written  or oral, by Apple.   This  Agreement  may  be
amended only by written agreement, signed by the parties to be bound by the
amendment.   Parol evidence will be inadmissible to show agreement  by  and
between the parties to any term or condition contrary to or in addition  to
the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

      Each  Apple  plan  or  policy  referred  to  herein  directly  or  by
implication (except the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans and the ELTSOP) is
incorporated herein only insofar as it does not contradict this  Agreement.
If  any  inconsistencies exist between this Agreement and any such plan  or
policy, this Agreement shall control.  If any inconsistencies exist between
this Agreement and any such plan or policy, this Agreement and the 1981 and
1990 Stock Option Plans or the ELTSOP, those stock plans shall control.

      Nothing in any such plan, policy, or this Agreement shall change  the
At  Will  nature of Diery's employment under this Agreement and  under  his
employment  agreement dated September 15, 1989, by which either  party  can
terminate  Diery's  employment without regard to cause.  Diery  understands
and  agrees  that  Apple  is  obligated to make the  payments  outlined  in
paragraph  3  and  4  of  this Agreement in the  event  Diery's  employment
terminates before Termination Date for any reason other than:
          a.   by Apple for "Business Reasons" as defined below;
     
           b.    by  Diery for any reason, except if Diery's employment  is
terminated  for any material  breach by Apple of this Agreement.   In  this
event, Diery will be entitled to the payments outlined in paragraph 3 and 4
adjusted  according  to  the  actual,  accelerated  Termination  Date   and
offsetting  any  payments  made to him prior  to  the  actual,  accelerated
Termination Date;

For purposes of this Agreement only, "Business Reasons" shall mean that you
are terminated for the following reasons:

               (i)  you have engaged in unfair competition with Apple; or

                (ii)  you have induced any customer of Apple to breach  any
contract with Apple;

                (iii)     you have made any unauthorized disclosure  of  or
otherwise  misused any of the secrets  or confidential information of Apple;

                (iv)  you have committed any act of embezzlement, fraud  or
theft with respect to any Apple property;

                (v)  you have violated any Apple policy or guideline or the
terms of this Agreement;







                                       22

                (vi) you have caused material loss, damage or injury to  or
otherwise   endangered  the  property, reputation   or employees of Apple;

                (vii)      you  have engaged in malfeasance, negligence  or
misconduct,  or  failed  to perform reasonable duties  and responsibilities
consistent with your fiduciary duties and responsibilities to Apple; or

                (viii)     you  have  failed  to  act  in  accordance  with
specific,    reasonable    and    lawful    instructions    from    Apple's
Chief Executive Officer, or his delegate.

      12.   Right to Advice of Counsel.  Diery understands that he has  the
right  to have this Agreement reviewed by his lawyer and acknowledges  that
Apple  has  encouraged him to consult with his lawyer so that he  is  fully
aware   of  his  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement.    Diery
acknowledges that he has done so.

      13.   Modification.   This Agreement may not  be  amended,  modified,
changed or discharged in any respect except as agreed in writing and signed
by Diery and the Chief Executive Officer of Apple Computer, Inc.

     14.  Severability and Interpretation.  In the event that any provision
or  any  portion  of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable  by  a
court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or portion thereof shall be
considered separate and apart from the remainder of this Agreement and  the
other  provisions shall remain fully valid and enforceable, provided  that,
if paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 19 and 21 are held to be invalid or unenforceable in
response  to a motion, argument or other act by Diery, then Apple,  at  its
sole  discretion,  may rescind the Agreement and recover all  consideration
paid to Diery under the Agreement.

      15.   Notices.  All notices required by this Agreement shall by given
in  writing  either  by personal delivery or by first  class  mail,  return
receipt requested.  Notices shall be addressed as follows:

     To Apple: Apple Computer, Inc.
               1 Infinite Loop, Mail Stop 38-I
               Cupertino, California 95014
               Attention:  General Counsel

     To Diery : 4175 Woodside Road
                Woodside, California 94062


or  in  each case to such other address as Diery or Apple shall notify  the
other.   Notice given by mail shall be deemed given five (5) days following
the date of mailing.

      16.   Miscellaneous.  The rights and obligations of Apple under  this
Agreement  shall  inure to the benefit of and shall  be  binding  upon  the
present  and  future subsidiaries of Apple, any and all subsidiaries  of  a
subsidiary,  all  affiliated corporations, and successors  and  assigns  of
Apple.  No assignment of this Agreement by Apple will relieve Apple of  its
obligations.   Diery shall not assign any of his rights and/or  obligations
under this Agreement and any such attempted assignment will be void.   This
Agreement shall be binding upon Diery heirs, executors, administrators,  or
other legal representatives and their legal assigns.

      17.   Damage  Limitation.  At Termination Date, Diery  shall  not  be
entitled  to  recover  any  compensation, benefits  or  damages  except  as
specifically described in this Agreement.  This damage waiver provides that
no  damages (including without limitation, special, consequential, general,
liquidated or punitive damages) shall be sought or due from Apple.

      18.   Waiver.   A  waiver by either party of  any  of  the  terms  or
conditions  of  this  Agreement in any instance  shall  not  be  deemed  or
construed  to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future,  or  of
any   subsequent  breach  thereof.   All  remedies,  rights,  undertakings,
obligations, and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be cumulative
and  none  of  them  shall  be in limitation of any  other  remedy,  right,
undertaking, obligation or agreement of either party.

     19.  Release.  Diery hereby completely releases and forever discharges
Michael  Spindler,  Apple,  its  officers,  directors,  agents,  employees,
attorneys,  insurers, subsidiaries and affiliates ("Apple  Parties")  from,
and  covenants  not  to sue any Apple Party with respect  to,  all  claims,
rights,  demands,  actions,  obligations, debts,  sums  of  money,  damages
(including  but  not limited to general, special, punitive, liquidated  and
compensatory  damages)  and  causes of action of  every  kind,  nature  and
character,  known  and  unknown, in law or equity, connected  with  Diery's
employment  relationship  with  the Apple Parties,  or  any  other  act  or
omission of any Apple Party which may have occurred prior to the date  this
Agreement  is  signed.   Diery further agrees that by  his  acceptance  and
negotiation of the payment provided for in paragraph (4) of this Agreement,
he   thereby  completely releases and forever discharges the Apple  Parties
from, and covenants not to sue any Apple Party with respect to, all claims,
rights,  demands,  actions,  obligations, debts,  sums  of  money,  damages
(including  but  not limited to general, special, punitive, liquidated  and
compensatory  damages)  and  causes of action of  every  kind,  nature  and
character,  known  and  unknown, in law or equity, connected  with  Diery's
employment relationship with the Apple Parties, or the termination of  such
relationship,  or any other act or omission of any Apple  Party  which  may
have  occurred  prior  to  Termination Date.  This  release  and  discharge
includes,  but  is  not  limited to, all "wrongful discharge"  claims;  all
claims  relating  to any contracts of employment express  or  implied;  any
covenant of good faith and fair dealing express or implied; any tort of any
nature:  any federal, state, or municipal statute or ordinance; any  claims
under  the  California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title  VII  of  the
Civil  Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, and any other  laws  and
regulations  relating to employment discrimination and any and  all  claims
for  attorney's fees and costs.  Diery specifically acknowledges  that  the
foregoing  release includes a complete release and discharge of  all  Apple
Parties  from  any  and  all claims, damages of any kind,  and  claims  for
attorneys fees and costs, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of
1967  ("ADEA")  as  amended  by  the Older Worker  Benefit  Protection  Act
("OWBPA").  Diery and Apple agree that part of the consideration payable to
Diery  under this Agreement is consideration that Diery would not otherwise
be  entitled to and is in consideration for Diery's release of claims under
the ADEA as amended by the OWBPA.

     Diery acknowledges that he understands the protections provided by the
OWBPA  and that the provisions of the OWBPA have been met by the  terms  of
this Agreement.  Diery states that he knowingly and voluntarily enters into
this  Agreement.  Diery acknowledges that this Agreement is  written  in  a
manner calculated to be understood by him. Diery further acknowledges  that
this   Agreement  refers  without  limitation  to  rights  under  the   Age
Discrimination  in  Employment  Act.   Diery  understands  that   by   this
Agreement, he does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date
the  Agreement  is executed.  Diery acknowledges that he is  entering  this
Agreement in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to
which  he  already is entitled due to his employment with Apple.   Further,
Diery  acknowledges  that this release of claims under  the  OWBPA  is  not
requested  in connection with an exit incentive program or other employment
termination  program  offered to a group or class of employees  within  the
meaning  of  OWBPA. Diery acknowledges that he has been allowed  up  to  21
(twenty-one) days from the date that he received this Agreement  to  accept
its  terms.  Diery acknowledges he has consulted with an attorney about the
Agreement.  Diery acknowledges that after he signs the Agreement,  he  will
then  be  given  seven (7) days following the date on which  he  signs  the
Agreement  to revoke it and that this Agreement will only become  effective
after this seven (7) day period has lapsed.  Any such revocation must be in
writing  signed  by  Diery  and immediately delivered  to  Apple's  General
Counsel.

      Diery  has  read and expressly waives Section 1542 of the  California
Civil Code, which provides as follows:

      A  GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR  DOES
NOT  KNOW  OR  SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF  EXECUTING  THE
RELEASE,  WHICH  IF  KNOWN  BY HIM  MUST HAVE  MATERIALLY  AFFECTED  HIS
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

     This waiver is not a mere recital, but is a known waiver of rights and
benefits.   This  is  a bargained-for provision of this  Agreement  and  is
further consideration for the covenants and conditions contained herein.

      The  Apple  Parties hereby release and forever discharge  Diery,  his
agents  and  attorneys from, and covenant not to sue Diery, his agents  and
attorneys   with   respect  to,  all  claims,  rights,  demands,   actions,
obligations, debts, sums of money, damages, and causes of action ("claims")
arising from his employment relationship with Apple to the extent permitted
by  law  and  public  policy,  except  for  any  claims  arising  from  any
intentional  acts of misconduct, or any other act taken  in  bad  faith  or
without a reasonable belief that it was in the best interests of the  Apple
Parties.

     20.  Cooperation.  Diery agrees that at all times he will make himself
available,  for  such  amounts  of time as Apple's  General  Counsel  shall
reasonably deem necessary, to participate in the conduct of and preparation
for any pending or future litigation to which Apple is a party and in which
his experience or knowledge may be relevant.  Diery shall be reimbursed for
reasonable  travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred  by  virtue  of  his
cooperation  as  described in this paragraph.  In  no  respect  shall  this
provision  be  deemed to pertain to or affect the nature  or  substance  of
Diery  testimony at deposition or trial or in any other truthful  testimony
at deposition or trial or in any other circumstances.

     21.  Remedies in Event of Future Dispute.

           a.    Except as provided in subparagraph (b) below, in the event
of  any  future  dispute, controversy or claim between the parties  arising
from  or  relating to this Agreement, its breach, any matter  addressed  by
this  Agreement,  and/or Diery's employment with Apple through  Termination
Date,  the  parties  will  first attempt to  resolve  the  dispute  through
confidential mediation to be conducted in San Francisco by a member of  the
firm  of  Gregoria,  Haldeman & Piazza, Mediated Negotiations,  625  Market
Street,  Suite  400,  San  Francisco, California 94105.   If  the  parties'
dispute  is  not  resolved through mediation, it will be  resolved  through
binding   confidential  arbitration  to  be  conducted  by  the    American
Arbitration  Association  in  San Francisco,  pursuant  to  its  Commercial
Arbitration   Rules,  and  judgment  upon  the  award   rendered   by   the
Arbitrator(s)  may  be  entered by any court  having  jurisdiction  of  the
matter.   The  prevailing party in such arbitration shall  be  entitled  to
recover  from the losing party, not only the amount of any judgment awarded
in  its  favor,  but  also  any and all costs  and  expenses,  incurred  in
arbitrating the dispute or in preparing for such arbitration.

           b.    In  the  event that a dispute arises concerning compliance
with  this Agreement, either party will be entitled to obtain from a  court
with  jurisdiction  over the parties preliminary and  permanent  injunctive
relief  to enjoin or restrict the other party from such breach or to enjoin
or  restrict  a  third  party  from inducing any  such  breach,  and  other
appropriate  relief, including money damages.  In seeking any such  relief,
however,  the  moving  party will retain the right to  have  any  remaining
portion of the controversy resolved by binding confidential arbitration  in
accordance with subparagraph (a) above.

     By signing the below, the parties agree to the terms hereof, including
the  Exhibits hereto, and agree that this document, and Exhibits A,  B,  C,
and D hereto, sets forth their entire agreement.

                                   APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results have been included.  All adjustments are  of  a  normal
   recurring nature unless specified in a separate note included  in  these
   Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The results  for  interim
   periods  are  not necessarily indicative of results to be  expected  for
   the  entire year.  These financial statements and notes should  be  read
   in   conjunction  with  the  Company's  annual  consolidated   financial
   statements  and  the notes thereto for the fiscal year  ended  September
   30,  1994, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   September 30, 1994 (the "1994 Form 10-K").

2. In  the first quarter of 1995, the Company lowered its estimates of  the
   total  remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan  initiated
   in  the  third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased
   income  by  $17 million ($11 million, or $0.09 per share, after  taxes).
   This  adjustment primarily reflected favorable cancellation  settlements
   of   certain  R&D  project  commitments  and  facility  leases  and  the
   completion of other actions at lower costs than originally estimated.

   At  March 31, 1995, the Company had $26 million of accrued restructuring
   costs  for  actions  that  are currently under way.   Approximately  $20
   million  in  charges to the accrual are expected to be  incurred  during
   1995 with the remaining $6 million incurred beyond 1995.  Charges to  be
   incurred  beyond  1995  relate  primarily to  recurring  payments  under
   certain noncancelable operating leases.

   The  following  table  depicts  a  roll-forward  reconciliation  of  the
   activity  in the restructuring accrual balance from September  30,  1994
   to March 31, 1995:

4. Effective October 1, 1994, the Company adopted Financial  Accounting
   Standard No. 115 (FAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in  Debt
   and  Equity  Securities".   In accordance with  FAS  115,  prior  period
   financial  statements have not been restated to reflect  the  change  in
   accounting  principle.   The cumulative effect of  the  change  was  not
   material to shareholders' equity as of October 1, 1994.  Under FAS  115,
   debt  securities that a company has both the positive intent and ability
   to  hold  to  maturity are carried at amortized cost.   Debt  securities
   that a company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold  to
   maturity  and all marketable equity securities are classified as  either
   available-for-sale   or  trading  and  are  carried   at   fair   value.
   Generally,  unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified
   as  available-for-sale  are  reported as a  component  of  shareholders'
   equity.   Unrealized  holding gains and losses on securities  classified
   as trading are included in earnings.

   The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily of  certificates  of
   deposit,  time  deposits and commercial paper with maturities  of  three
   months  or less at the date of purchase.  Short-term investments consist
   principally  of  commercial  paper with  maturities  between  three  and
   twelve  months.  The Company's marketable equity securities  consist  of
   securities  issued  by  U. S. corporations and are  included  in  "Other
   assets"  on the accompanying balance sheet.  As of March 31, 1995,   the
   Company's   cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  marketable
   equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.

   The  adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding
   gains  (losses)  on available-for-sale cash equivalents and  short  term
   investments  were not material either individually or in the  aggregate,
   at  March 31, 1995.  The net adjustment recorded to shareholders' equity
   for  unrealized  holding  gains (losses) related  to  marketable  equity
   securities was an unrealized gain of approximately $40 million at  March
   31, 1995.  The realized gains (losses) recorded to earnings on sales  of
   available-for-sale securities, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   were not material for the three and six months ended March 31, 1995.

5. U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $372
   million   of   undistributed   earnings   of   the   Company's   foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested   in  operations  outside  the  United  States.   It   is   not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely  invested earnings, the Company provides  for  federal  and
   state  income  taxes  currently  on undistributed  earnings  of  foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The   Internal   Revenue  Service  has  proposed  federal   income   tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and the Company  has  made
   prepayments   thereon.    The  Company  has  contested   these   alleged
   deficiencies  and  is  pursuing administrative  and  judicial  remedies.
   Management  believes  that adequate provision  has  been  made  for  any
   adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

6. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options outstanding during the period.

7. Certain prior year amounts on the consolidated statements of cash  flows
   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

8. On  January 25, 1995, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of
   $0.12  per  share  related to the Company's first fiscal  quarter  ended
   December  30, 1994.  The dividend was distributed on March 10, 1995,  to
   shareholders of record as of February 17, 1995.  On April 27,  1995, the
   Board  of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share for  the
   Company's  second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 1995.  The dividend  is
   payable on June 23, 1995, to shareholders of record as of June 2, 1995.

Net  sales  for  the second quarter and first six months of 1995  increased
over the comparable periods of 1994, primarily resulting from a combination
of  unit growth and higher average selling prices.  The increase in average
selling  prices  was driven by a shift in mix towards the  Company's  newer
products  and products with multi-media configurations.  Specifically,  the
Company recorded strong sales of its Performa (registered trademark) 630, 
and of products  within the   Power  Macintosh(registered trademark) family
and  PowerBook (registered trademark)  500  series  of  personal
computers.  Increased sales of these products contributed to an increase in
the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh (registered trademark) computer
unit of approximately 10%  and  17%  in  the  second  quarter  and  first  
six  months  of  1995, respectively,  over  the  comparable periods  of  
1994.   Total  Macintosh computer  unit sales increased 21% and 9% in the 
second quarter  and  first six months of 1995, respectively, over the 
comparable periods of 1994. This unit  sales growth principally resulted 
from strong sales of the  Company's Power  Macintosh products, PowerBook 
500 series of personal computers and newer  product  offerings within the 
Performa family  of  desktop  personal computers.  This unit growth was 
partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the Company's 
older product offerings.

International  net sales grew 34% and 26% in the second quarter  and  first
six  months  of  1995, respectively, over the comparable periods  of  1994,
primarily  reflecting  strong  net sales  growth  in  the  Pacific  region,
particularly Japan.  Net sales for the second quarter and first six  months
of  1995  grew  moderately in Europe over the comparable periods  of  1994.
International net sales represented 54% and 51% of total net sales for  the
second  quarter and first six months of 1995, respectively,  compared  with
52%  and  48%,  respectively,   for  the  corresponding  periods  of  1994.
Domestic  net  sales grew 21% and 15% in the second quarter and  first  six
months  of  1995,  respectively,  over  the  comparable  periods  of  1994,
primarily  resulting  from  strong growth in the  education,  consumer  and
business markets.

In  general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an  as-
needed  basis due to the Company's distribution strategy, which is designed
to  expedite  the filling of orders.  Resellers frequently change  delivery
schedules   and  order  rates  depending  on  changing  market  conditions.
Unfilled  orders ("backlog") can be, and often are, canceled at will.   The
Company  attempts  to  fill  orders on the  requested  delivery  schedules.
However, products may be in relatively short supply from time to time until
production  volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet  demand  or  if
other  production or fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's  backlog
increased to  approximately  $795  million  at  May  5,  1995,  from
approximately $670 million at February 3, 1995, primarily due to backlog of
the Company's Power Macintosh products.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time  is  not a meaningful indication of  its  future  business
prospects.   In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation  of  or
immediately following introduction of new products because of over-ordering
by  dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced sharply  once
dealers  and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.   Because
of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog,
backlog should not
                                        
                                        8
<PAGE>

be  considered  a  reliable indicator of the Company's  future  revenue  or
financial performance.  Further information regarding the Company's backlog
may  be  found  under Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q  under  the  heading
"Factors that May Affect Future Results
and  Financial  Condition",  which information is  hereby  incorporated  by
reference.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and
its  cost  of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the  sale  of
products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for  its
products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based
primarily  on  the cost of components and to a lesser extent, direct  labor
costs.    The   type  and  cost  of  components  included   in   particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and  disk  drives)
is  often directly related to the need to market products in configurations
competitive  with  other producers.  Competition in the  personal  computer
industry is intense, and in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and
product  configuration are often necessary in order to remain  competitive.
Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly
influenced  in  the  short term by actions undertaken  by  the  Company  in
response to industry-wide competitive pressures.

Gross  margin  increased both in amount and as a percentage  of  net  sales
during the second quarter and first six months of 1995, respectively,  over
the  comparable  periods  of  1994.  The increase  in  gross  margin  as  a
percentage  of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in  product  mix
towards  the  Company's  newer  high margin products  within  each  product
category which included strong sales of the Company's entry level Macintosh
Performa  630,  and of products within its Power Macintosh family  and  its
PowerBook 500 series of personal computers.

The  increase  in  gross margin levels was affected somewhat  favorably  by
changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a  weaker  U.S.
dollar  relative to certain foreign currencies during both  the  first  and
second  quarters of 1995 compared with the corresponding  periods of  1994.
The  Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes  in
exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations  can
be  significantly  affected in the short term by  fluctuations  in  foreign
currency exchange rates.

The  Company's  gross margin percentage declined from 28.7%  in  the  first
quarter of 1995 to 26.2% in the second quarter of 1995, resulting primarily
from   the   Company's   pricing    strategies,    particularly  on   entry
level and PowerBook notebook personal computers, and to a lesser extent  on
Power Macintosh products.  It is anticipated that gross margins will remain
under pressure and could fall below prior years' levels worldwide due to  a
variety  of  factors, including continued industry-wide pricing  pressures,
increased competition, and compressed product life cycles.

Research  and  development expenditures increased in amount in  the  second
quarter of 1995 when compared with the corresponding period of 1994, due to
higher  project-  and headcount- related spending.  During  the  first  six
months  of  1995,  research  and development  expenditures  decreased  when
compared with the corresponding period of 1994, primarily reflecting  lower
product  development expenditures during the first quarter  of  1995  as  a
result  of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs  as
well  as  fewer  new  product introductions in the first  quarter  of  1995
compared with the corresponding period of 1994.

As  a  percentage  of  net  sales, research  and  development  expenditures
decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 1995 compared  with
the  corresponding periods of 1994, primarily due to the  increase  in  the
level of net sales.

Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased in  amount  in  the
second  quarter  and  first  six months of  1995  when  compared  with  the
corresponding  periods of 1994.  This increase was primarily  a  result  of
increased advertising and channel marketing program spending as the Company
continued its efforts to expand its market share.  Despite this increase in
expenditures, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased  as  a
percentage of net sales in the second quarter and first six months of  1995
when compared with the corresponding periods of 1994, primarily as a result
of  the  increase  in  the level of net sales combined with  the  Company's
ongoing efforts to manage operating expense growth.

The  Company  will  continue  to face the challenge  of  managing  selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses relative  to  gross  margin  levels,
particularly in light of the Company's expectation of continued pressure on
gross  margins, and continued competitive pressures worldwide.  The Company
anticipates that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase
in amount during the remaining quarters of 1995, but will remain relatively
flat as a percentage of net sales.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $43
million  in  expense in the second quarter of 1995 compared with  the  same
period in 1994.  The increase in expense was primarily driven by net losses
recorded   for  the  mark-to-market  valuation  of  outstanding  currency
forwards  and sold currency options undertaken for currency risk management
purposes, and to a lesser extent, higher overall hedging costs as a  result
of  the  increased volatility in the exchange markets as the value  of  the
U.S.  dollar  declined  dramatically relative to other  foreign  currencies
during  March of 1995.  The increase in expense was slightly offset  by  an
increase in net interest income resulting from higher cash balances coupled
with  higher  investment interest rates.  As of May 1, 1995, the  Company's
net  mark-to-market valuation of outstanding currency forwards  and  sold
currency  options  undertaken for currency risk  management  purposes  has
remained  consistent  with the net mark-to-market valuation  recorded  at
March 31, 1995.

Interest  and  other income (expense), net, increased by approximately  $28
million in expense for the first six months of 1995 when compared with  the
corresponding period of 1994, reflecting the $43 million increase in mark-
to-market losses, and expense related

                                       10
<PAGE>

to  foreign exchange risk management activity during the second quarter  of
1995 as discussed above.  This increase in expense was partially offset  by
a  $15 million increase in interest and other income, net, during the first
quarter  of 1995 when compared with the corresponding period of 1994  which
reflected  increased interest income of $8 million, net gains from  foreign
currency risk management activity, and a decrease in interest expense.

Notional  principal  amounts on certain of the Company's  foreign  exchange
instruments increased significantly compared with the balances at September
30,  1994,  in  accordance  with  the Company's  currency  risk  management
strategies.  Specifically, notional principal amounts on purchased and sold
foreign   exchange   options  not  accounted  for   as   hedges   increased
approximately $4.7 billion and $3.8 billion respectively, compared with the
balances  at September 30. 1994.  The notional principal amounts  for  off-
balance-sheet  instruments provide one measure of  the  transaction  volume
outstanding at a particular point in time, and do not necessarily represent
the  amount  of  the Company's exposure to credit or market risk.  The  net
impact   of  the  mark-to-market  valuation  on  these  foreign  exchange
instruments is discussed in the preceding paragraphs.

May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report  on  Form

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on  the Company's ability to successfully develop,  manufacture,
and  market  technologically innovative products in order to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future operating results and financial condition.

Product Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's  ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the  availability of application software for new products,  the  effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and
the manufacturing of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated
demand.  Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that
new products will have on its sales or results of operations.

In  1994,  the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of  Macintosh
computers  based  on  a  new PowerPC family of RISC  microprocessors.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition may  be  adversely
affected  if  it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its
lines  of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series  of
microprocessors  to  the  PowerPC (registered trademark) microprocessor.
The  success  of  this ongoing transition will depend on the Company's 
ability to continue to sell products  based  on  the  Motorola 68000 series
of  microprocessors  while gaining  market acceptance of the new PowerPC 
processor-based products, to successfully  manage inventory levels of both
product lines simultaneously, and  to  continue to coordinate the timely 
development and distribution  by independent   software  vendors  of  new
"native"  software applications specifically designed for the PowerPC 
processor-based products.

                                       11
<PAGE>

The  rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new
product  is  not necessarily an indication of the future rate of  shipments
for  that  product, which depends on many factors, some of  which  are  not
under  the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to  purchase
new  technology  prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users  ("early
adopters");  purchases  in  satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by  users  who
anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of  other
products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to  the
aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,
such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many users until new technology  is
accepted  as  "proven"  and for which commonly used software  products  are
available;  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they  believe  they
can obtain sufficient supply of product previously in backlog.

Backlog  is  often  volatile after new product  introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned  demand  factors, often increasing sharply  coincident  with
introduction, and then reducing sharply once dealers and customers  believe
they can obtain sufficient supply of product.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability  of  European-language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial  demand for the Company's new products  outside  the  United
States,  even though  localized  versions of the  Company's  products  may
be available.

Competition

The  personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues  to  be
characterized  by  consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,
aggressive pricing practices, and downward pressure on gross margins.   The
Company's  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely
affected  should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact  of
industry-wide  pricing  pressures. 

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected   by   the  Company's  ability  to  offer  customers   competitive
technologies while effectively managing the impact on inventory levels  and
the potential for customer confusion created by product proliferation.

On  November  7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with  International
Business  Machines Corporation (IBM) and Motorola, Inc. on a  new  hardware
reference  platform  for the PowerPC microprocessor  that  is  intended  to
deliver a much wider range of operating system and application choices  for
computer customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company intends  to
make  the  Macintosh  operating system available on  the  common  platform.
Accordingly,    the  Company's  future  operating  results  and   financial
condition  may  be  affected by its ability to implement this  and  certain
other  collaboration agreements entered into, and to manage the  associated
competitive risk.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by the Company's ability to increase market share in its personal
computer  business.  The Company recently announced the  licensing  of  the
Macintosh operating system to other personal computer vendors in January of
1995,  and  one  vendor  is currently selling product  which  utilizes  the
Macintosh operating system.  However, the Company is currently the  primary
maker  of hardware that uses the Macintosh operating system, and it  has  a
minority  market share in the personal computer market, which is  dominated
by  makers  of  computers  that  run the  MS-DOS(registered trademark)  
and  Microsoft  Windows (trademark) operating systems.  Certain of the 
Company's personal computer products are capable  of running application 
software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating   systems,  through
software  emulation  of  Intel   Corporation microprocessor  chips  by  use 
of software specifically  designed  for  the Company's  products,  either 
those based on the Motorola  68000  series  of microprocessors or those 
based on the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  Company also recently introduced 
products which include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601 microprocessor and 
the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor which enable users  to switch between 
Macintosh and DOS computing environments.  In addition, as a result of the 
collaboration agreement noted in the preceding paragraph, the Company  
believes it may have the opportunity to increase its market  share
in the personal computer business as the Macintosh operating system becomes
available on computers based on the new hardware reference platform.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often
                                        
                                       12
<PAGE>

based   on   the  availability  of  third-party  software  for   particular
applications.   The Company believes that the availability  of  third-party
application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on
the  third-party  developers'  perception  and  analysis  of  the  relative
benefits  of  developing  such software for the Company's  products  versus
software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is  based
on factors such as the relative market share of the Company's products, the
anticipated  potential  revenue  that may  be  earned,  and  the  costs  of
developing such software products.

In  an  effort to increase overall market share, the Company has  commenced
licensing  the  Macintosh  operating  system  to  other  personal  computer
vendors.  The Company anticipates that the licensing activities will result
in  a  variety of these vendors bringing to market personal computers  that
will run application software based on the Macintosh operating system.  The
Company  also  believes  that  licensing the operating  system  will  offer
software  vendors a broader installed base on which they  can  develop  and
provide  technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  However,  there
can  be  no  assurance on the number of application software titles or the
rate at which  vendors  will bring  to  market  application software based
on  the  Macintosh  operating system.  The Company's efforts to increase 
its overall market share through licensing  of  the  Macintosh operating 
system is  also  dependent  on  the Company's  ability to manage the risks
associated with competing  companies producing  Macintosh OS-based computer
systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company cannot  determine  the  ultimate 
effect that  licensing  of  the  Macintosh operating system will have on
its sales or results of operations.

Microsoft  Corporation is the developer of the MS-DOS and Windows operating
systems,  which  are  the  principal competing  operating  systems  to  the
Company's  Macintosh  operating system.  Microsoft  is  also  an  important
developer of application software for the Company's products.  Accordingly,
Microsoft's  interest in producing application software for  the  Company's
products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as an
operating system vendor.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
new  PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors which produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by  most personal computers  using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows  operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based  on  the
Intel microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also
the  developer  of  OS/2,  a competing operating system  to  the  Company's
Macintosh  operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying  the
Company  with  improved  versions  of  microprocessors  for  the  Company's
products  may  be  influenced by IBM's perception of  its  interests  as  a
competing  manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing  operating
system vendor.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected  by  the  Company's   ability  to  successfully  expand  its   new
businesses  and product offerings into other markets, such as  the  markets
for on-line services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.

Global Market Risks

A  large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international
operations.   As  a result, the Company's operations and financial  results
could  be significantly affected by international factors, such as  changes
in  foreign  currency  exchange rates or weak economic  conditions  in  the
foreign  markets in which the Company distributes its products.   When  the
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value  of
non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens,  the
U.S.    dollar   value   of   non-U.S.   dollar-based   sales    increases.
Correspondingly,  the  U.S.  dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based  costs
increases  when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S.  dollar
strengthens.   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of  currencies  other
than  the  U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar  and  is
adversely  affected  by  a  stronger dollar relative  to  major  currencies
worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may  negatively  affect
the  Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed  in  U.S.
dollars).

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on
the   Company's  non-U.S.  dollar-based  sales,  product  procurement,  and
operating  expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based
exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange  forward
and  option  contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.   Currently,
hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The
Company  also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge  certain
other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,
but  not  firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.   To
reduce  the  costs  associated with these ongoing foreign exchange  hedging
programs,  the  Company  also  regularly  sells  foreign  exchange   option
contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All
foreign exchange
                                        
                                       13
<PAGE>

forward  and  option contracts not accounted for as hedges,  including  all
transactions  intended to reduce the costs associated  with  the  Company's
foreign  exchange  hedging programs, are carried  at  fair  value  and  are
adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.

While  the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the  interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's  leading  industrialized  countries,  the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations  in
the  general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S.
interest  rates  affect  the interest earned on the  Company's  cash,  cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments as well as interest  paid  on  its
short-term  borrowings  and  long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into  interest
rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps are intended  to
better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash,  cash
equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest  rate
swap,  swaption, and option transactions in order to extend  the  effective
duration  of  a  portion  of  its  cash, cash  equivalent,  and  short-term
investment portfolios. These swaps may extend the Company's cash investment
horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.

To  ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange
and  interest  rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor  the  risks  and
opportunities of the non hedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors
its  foreign  exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate
swap,  swaption,  and  option  positions on  a  stand-alone  basis  and  in
conjunction  with  its  underlying foreign  currency-  and  interest  rate-
related  exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and  an  economic
perspective.   However, given the effective horizons of the Company's  risk
management  activities, there can be no assurance that  the  aforementioned
programs  will  offset more than a portion of the adverse financial  impact
resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest
rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of  gains
and losses related to  marked-to-market instruments for any given period
may  not  coincide  with  the timing of gains and  losses  related  to  the
underlying  economic  exposures,  and as such,  may  adversely  affect  the
Company's operating results and financial position.

Inventory and Supply

The  Company's  products  include  certain  components,  such  as  specific
microprocessors  manufactured  by  Motorola,  Inc.,  that   are   currently
available   only  from  single  sources.   Any  availability   limitations,
interruptions in supplies, or price increases of these and other components
could  adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.
Continued growth in the personal computer industry may create demand for
certain components that exceeds the present manufacturing capacity of 
component suppliers.  If the Company cannot obtain an adequate supply of 
either custom-made or commonly-used components due to competitive factors
in the personal computer industry, the Company's future operating results
and financial condition may be adversely affected by product constraints 
and increased costs.  The Company's  future  operating results and financial
condition may also be adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage
inventory levels  and lead times required to obtain components in order to 
be more responsive to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In 
addition, if anticipated unit  sales  growth for new and current product 
offerings is not  realized, inventory  valuation reserves may be necessary 
that would adversely  affect the Company's results of operations and 
financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution of
the  Company's  products.   Currently,  the  Company's  primary  means   of
distribution  is  through  third-party  computer  resellers.   However,  in
response  to  changing  industry practices and  customer  preferences,  the
Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels, such as
mass-merchandise  stores  (for  example,  Sears  and  Wal-Mart),   consumer
electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business  and
financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of
these sellers weakens or if sellers within consumer channels decide not  to
continue to distribute the Company's products.

Other Factors

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

The Company plans to replace its current transaction systems (which include
order  management, distribution, manufacturing, and finance) with a  single
integrated  system  as  part of its ongoing effort to increase  operational
efficiency.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition
could  be  adversely affected by its ability to implement  and  effectively
manage the transition to this new integrated system.


                                       14
<PAGE>

In April 1995, the Company announced a company-wide reorganization designed
to  more  closely  align the Company's organizational  structure  with  the
Company's  business strategy of placing increased focus on  customer  needs
and  expanding  its presence in the home, education, and business  markets.
Although the Company does not anticipate any downsizing as a result of  the
organizational  changes,  the  Company's  future  operating   results   and
financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected  by  its  ability   to
effectively manage the transition to this new organizational structure.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.

Cash generated by financing activities   $   343
                                        
The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents and
short-term  investments, net of short-term borrowings increased  to  $1,359
million  at  March 31, 1995 from $966 million at September 30, 1994.   This
increase  was primarily attributable to the Company's continued efforts  to
increase profit levels and to manage working capital, particularly  in  the
areas of inventory and accounts receivable.

Cash  generated by operations during the first six months of  1995  totaled
$460  million.  Cash was generated primarily by higher sales levels related
to  a  shift in product mix towards higher-margin products which  typically
have higher average selling prices.

Net  cash  used  for the purchase of property, plant and equipment  totaled
approximately  $52  million during the first six  months  of  1995.   These
purchases  primarily included manufacturing machinery and  equipment.   The
Company  anticipates that capital expenditures in 1995 will  be  relatively
consistent with 1994 expenditures of $160 million.

Short-term  borrowings  at March 31, 1995 were approximately  $335  million
higher than at September 30, 1994.  These borrowings were primarily made to
fund  expected  working  capital growth in certain markets  worldwide.   In
general,  the Company's short-term borrowings typically reflect  borrowings
made under its commercial paper program and short-term uncommitted bid-line
arrangements  with certain commercial banks.  In particular,  Apple  Japan,
Inc.,  and  Apple Computer BV, (Netherlands), wholly owned subsidiaries  of
the  Company,  incurred short-term borrowings from several banks,  totaling
approximately  $457  million and $170 million, respectively, at  March  31,
1995.

Long-term  borrowings of $304 million at March 31, 1995 remained consistent
with the balance at September 30, 1994.  Substantially the entire amount of
long-term borrowings represents $300 million aggregate principal amount  of
6.5%  unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration  statement
filed  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.   This  shelf
registration covers the
registration  of debt and other securities for an aggregate offering  price
of  up  to  $500 million.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of  par,  for  an
effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually
and mature on February 15, 2004.

The  Company  expects that it will continue to incur short-  and  long-term
borrowings  from  time  to time generally to finance U.S.  working  capital
needs  and  capital  expenditures, because a  substantial  portion  of  the
Company's  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments  is  held  by
foreign   subsidiaries,  generally  in  U.S.  dollar-denominated  holdings.
Amounts  held  by  foreign subsidiaries would be  subject  to  U.S.  income
taxation  upon  repatriation to the United States; the Company's  financial
statements fully provide for

                                       15
<PAGE>

any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984  through 1988, and the Company has  made  prepayments
thereon.   The  Company  has contested these alleged  deficiencies  and  is
pursuing  administrative  and judicial remedies. Management  believes  that
adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments that may result  from
these tax examinations.

The Company believes that its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-
term  investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-
and  long-term  borrowing  capabilities, will be  sufficient  to  meet  its
operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.


PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Reference is made to page 39 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report on Form 10-
K  under the subheading "Litigation" for a discussion of certain litigation
involving  Microsoft  Corporation  and  Hewlett-Packard  Company  and  1993
Securities and State Court Shareholders Action Litigation.

In  the  case of Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-
Packard  Company,  the  Company's petition for a writ  of  certiorari   was
denied  by  the  Supreme Court of the United States on February  21,  1995.
Accordingly, the decision of the appellate court affirming the dismissal of
the Company's copyright infringement case against Microsoft Corporation and
Hewlett-Packard is now final.  The remaining outstanding matter in the case
is  Microsoft's  and  Hewlett-Packard's requests  for  an  award  of  their
attorneys'  fees  under the Copyright Act.  The trial court  has  scheduled
preliminary proceedings on these requests, looking toward a hearing in July
1995 to resolve them.

With respect to the 1993 Securities and State Court Shareholders Action
Litigation, the Company announced on May 9, 1995, that all of the 
complaints filed in those cases have been voluntarily dismissed by the 
plaintiffs.  No payment or consideration of any kind was paid by the
defendants, including the Company.

The Company continues to believe the pending suits cited above in which the
Company  is  a  defendant, to be without merit and  intends  to  vigorously
defend  against these actions.  The Company believes the resolution of  all
of  these  matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition  and  results  of  operations as  reported  in  the  accompanying
financial  statements.  However, depending on the amount and timing  of  an
unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits, it is possible that the Company's
future results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected  in
a particular period.

EXHIBIT 10.A.20
                              Separation Agreement

      In  consideration of the mutual agreements set forth below, Ian Diery
("Diery")  and Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") agree to the following  terms
and conditions of this Separation Agreement (the "Agreement"):

      1.    Nature  of  Business.  Apple is in the business  of  designing,
developing,  producing,  selling and marketing  computer  systems,  related
products  and  services.  The business practices of Apple  and  the  market
conditions  in which Apple operates change rapidly and these  changes  have
necessitated    prompt    changes   in   management,    and/or    managers'
responsibilities.  These changes are needed from time to time in  the  high
level management positions such as those for which Diery has been employed.

      2.    Resignation  from  Office.  Employee hereby  resigns  from  his
position as Executive Vice President and General Manager, Personal Computer
Division,  effective as the date of this Agreement.  Diery  hereby  resigns
from all other positions he holds on behalf of Apple, its subsidiaries  and
affiliates,  which  positions are set forth at  Exhibit  A  hereto.   Diery
agrees  to  sign  all  appropriate  documentation  prepared  by  Apple   to
facilitate these resignations.

      3.     Employment Status/Termination.  Subject to paragraph 11 below,
from  the  date  of  this Agreement through October 15, 1995  ("Termination
Date")  or  such earlier date as a result of an event under  paragraph  11,
Diery will continue to devote his best efforts to Apple and will remain  an
employee  of  and fiduciary to Apple reporting to Edward B.  Stead.   Until
Termination  Date,  Diery  shall continue to receive  his  regular  salary,
participate  in  the Apple's FY '95 Senior/Executive Incentive  Bonus  Plan
("Bonus  Plan") and receive medical insurance benefits and agrees  that  he
will  use  his  accrued  vacation and sabbatical before  Termination  Date.
Apple  will designate Diery as a participant in Apple's Executive Severance
Plan  ("Plan")  on  or  about August 15, 1995,  or  such  earlier  date  as
determined  between the parties, and Diery will become eligible to  receive
the appropriate compensation and benefits under that Plan.

     4.   Compensation and Benefits Upon Termination.  Subject to paragraph
11 below, at Termination Date, Apple will pay the following:

           a.   Severance Payments.  Under the Plan, on Termination Date as
defined  above,  Diery is eligible to receive a lump sum severance  payment
equal  to  7  months'  pay  and a proration  of  his  FY  '96  bonus,  less
deductions.   Subject  to paragraph 11 below, Apple will  pay  Diery  eight
hundred  eighty  seven thousand, four hundred eighty-five thousand  dollars
($887,485),   less  deductions,  in  full  satisfaction  of   all   Apple's
obligations under the Plan, Bonus Plan and otherwise.  Diery shall be  paid
on or about Termination Date and such payment constitutes full compensation
under  the  Plan  ,  Bonus Plan and otherwise.  There  shall  be  no  other
payments  to Diery except as stated in this paragraph 4(a) and in paragraph
3 above and the amount of such payments shall be subject to paragraph 11.

          b.   Satisfaction of Repayment Obligations.  At Termination Date,
Diery  shall  have  satisfied any and all repayment  obligations  to  Apple
including  specifically his obligation to satisfy his  promissory  note  to
Apple relating to a down payment loan.  A copy of the promissory note  date
December  6,  1989 is attached hereto as Exhibit B.  Diery and Apple  agree
that the principal and interest due and owing as of October 15, 1995 is two
hundred  sixty-one  thousand, seven hundred ninety dollar  and  seventy-one
cents  ($261,790.71).   If this amount (or adjusted  amount  in  the  event
Diery's  Termination Date is prior to October 15, 1995) remains  unpaid  on
Termination Date, Diery agrees that the entire sum may be withheld from the
amounts otherwise payable to him under this Agreement.

           c.   Stock Options.  The Board or Apple's Stock Option Committee
(the  "Committee") previously granted Diery options to purchase  shares  of
Apple  Common  Stock under Apple's 1981 and 1990 Stock  Option  Plans  (the
"1981  and  1990  Plans") and options to purchase  shares  of  stock  under
Apple's  1987  Executive  Long  Term Stock Option  Plan  ("ELTSOP").   Such
options  shall continue to vest and be exercisable in accordance  with  the
terms  of  the grant agreement issued to Diery with respect to such grants,
and  the  terms  of  the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans  and  the  ELTSOP
administered by the Board or the Committee.








                                       20
<PAGE>


          d.   Receipt of Documentation.  Diery acknowledges that he has
previously  received  from Apple copies of pertinent  portions  of  Apple's
Senior/  Executive  Bonus Program, the 1981 and 1990  Stock  Option  Plans,
Apple's  ELTSOP,  the  Vacation and Holiday Policies, and  Apple's  Benefit
Plans  relating  to  health  care,  life insurance,  accidental  death  and
disability,  short  and  long term disability  and  Savings  Plans.   Diery
understands  and agrees to be bound by the written terms and conditions  of
these  various  plans,  policies or programs, and  agrees  that  Apple  has
reserved  the  right  and  option,  in  its  sole  discretion,  to  change,
interpret,  modify  or  terminate these and all other  plans,  policies  or
programs at any time without Diery's consent.

           e.    No  Other Benefits.  Diery will not be entitled to receive
any other compensation, bonus or benefits provided by, through or on behalf
of  Apple,  its  affiliates or subsidiaries, other than benefits  that  are
vested  as of the date of this Agreement and that are payable in accordance
with  the  terms of any applicable Benefit Plan, or otherwise provided  for
herein.

      5.    Confidentiality.  The terms of this Agreement are confidential.
Neither  Diery nor Apple will at any time disclose to any third  party  the
fact or terms of this Agreement, except as authorized by this agreement  or
as required by law.  Diery may also make such disclosure to his spouse, tax
advisor  or lawyer, all of whom shall be instructed to keep the information
disclosed to them confidential; any disclosure by any such party  shall  be
deemed  a  disclosure by Diery. Apple and Diery shall  not  disparage  each
other  in their communications in response to all inquiries from the press,
public media or any other third parties regarding this Agreement or Diery's
employment termination.

      6.    Trade Secrets, Proprietary and Confidential Information.  Diery
agrees   to   comply  with  Apple's  "Proprietary  Rights  and  Information
Agreement" which is attached hereto as Exhibit C to this Agreement

      In  addition, Diery agrees to continue to abide by the principles and
guidelines  in  Apple's  Global Ethics brochure, the  terms  of  which  are
incorporated herein.

      On  or  before Termination Date, Diery agrees to promptly return  all
proprietary and confidential information, including but not limited to  all
inventions,   discoveries,   improvements,  computer   programs,   designs,
documentation, notes, plans, drawings and copies thereof to Apple.

      Diery  and  Apple  agree that this section regarding  Trade  Secrets,
Proprietary  and Confidential Information shall survive the termination  of
this Agreement.

     7.   Fiduciary Duties/Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation.  Diery further
recognizes  that  Apple's work force constitutes  an  important  and  vital
aspect  of  its  business.  Diery agrees, therefore, that both  during  his
employment with Apple,and  for  a  period of six months following 
Termination Date, he shall  notsolicit, or assist others to become employed
by any firm, company or  other business enterprise.  Diery further 
represents that he has no time prior to this Agreement solicited or 
encouraged any employee to leave Apple.

      Diery  will  retain his fiduciary responsibilities to  Apple  to  the
extent  provided by law.  For six months following Termination Date,  Diery
will  not, without the prior express written consent of Apple, compete with
Apple  by engaging in or assisting others to develop or market products  or
services that are in competition with Apple products or services.   Diery's
agreement  not  to compete is limited to the states of California  and  New
York only.

      Diery  and  Apple  also  agree, that upon a breach  or  violation  or
threatened breach or violation of any confidentiality, trade secrets,  non-
competition or non-solicitation agreement by Diery contained herein, or  if
any  provision of Sections 5, 6, or 7 of this Agreement, Apple, in addition
to  all other remedies which might be available to it, shall be entitled as
a   matter  of  right  to  equitable  relief  in  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction, including the right to obtain injunctive relief  or  specific
performance.  Diery and Apple agree that the remedies at law for  any  such
breach  or violation are not fully adequate and that the injuries to  Apple
as a result of the continuation of any breach or violation are incapable of
full  calculation  in  monetary terms and therefore constitute  irreparable
harm.  This paragraph 7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

      8.    Indemnification.   All  rights  of  indemnification  previously
provided by Apple to Diery by Apple's By-Laws and/or by the Indemnification
Agreement  dated October 16, 1989, shall continue in full force and  effect
in  accordance with their terms, following the date of this  Agreement.   A
copy  of Diery's Indemnification Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit  D
to this Agreement.

      9.   Successors.  Apple will require any successor (whether direct or
indirect,  by  purchase,  merger, consolidation or  otherwise)  to  all  or
substantially  all  of  the business and/or assets of  Apple  to  expressly
assume  and agree to perform this Agreement in the manner and to  the  same
extent that Apple would be required to perform it if no such succession had
taken  place.   Failure  of Apple to obtain such assumption  and  agreement
prior  to  the effectiveness of any such succession shall entitle Diery  to
the  benefits listed in paragraph 4 of this Agreement, subject to the terms
and conditions therein.

      10.   Governing  Law.   The  validity,  interpretation,  effect,  and
enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
California without regard to its choice of law principles.

      11.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, and Exhibits A, B, C and D to
this  Agreement,  set forth the entire Agreement and understanding  between
Diery   and  Apple,  and  supersede  any  other  negotiations,  agreements,
understandings,  oral  agreements,  representations  or  past   or   future
practices,  whether  written  or oral, by Apple.   This  Agreement  may  be
amended only by written agreement, signed by the parties to be bound by the
amendment.   Parol evidence will be inadmissible to show agreement  by  and
between the parties to any term or condition contrary to or in addition  to
the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

      Each  Apple  plan  or  policy  referred  to  herein  directly  or  by
implication (except the 1981 and 1990 Stock Option Plans and the ELTSOP) is
incorporated herein only insofar as it does not contradict this  Agreement.
If  any  inconsistencies exist between this Agreement and any such plan  or
policy, this Agreement shall control.  If any inconsistencies exist between
this Agreement and any such plan or policy, this Agreement and the 1981 and
1990 Stock Option Plans or the ELTSOP, those stock plans shall control.

      Nothing in any such plan, policy, or this Agreement shall change  the
At  Will  nature of Diery's employment under this Agreement and  under  his
employment  agreement dated September 15, 1989, by which either  party  can
terminate  Diery's  employment without regard to cause.  Diery  understands
and  agrees  that  Apple  is  obligated to make the  payments  outlined  in
paragraph  3  and  4  of  this Agreement in the  event  Diery's  employment
terminates before Termination Date for any reason other than:
          a.   by Apple for "Business Reasons" as defined below;
     
           b.    by  Diery for any reason, except if Diery's employment  is
terminated  for any material  breach by Apple of this Agreement.   In  this
event, Diery will be entitled to the payments outlined in paragraph 3 and 4
adjusted  according  to  the  actual,  accelerated  Termination  Date   and
offsetting  any  payments  made to him prior  to  the  actual,  accelerated
Termination Date;

For purposes of this Agreement only, "Business Reasons" shall mean that you
are terminated for the following reasons:

               (i)  you have engaged in unfair competition with Apple; or

                (ii)  you have induced any customer of Apple to breach  any
contract with Apple;

                (iii)     you have made any unauthorized disclosure  of  or
otherwise  misused any of the secrets  or confidential information of Apple;

                (iv)  you have committed any act of embezzlement, fraud  or
theft with respect to any Apple property;

                (v)  you have violated any Apple policy or guideline or the
terms of this Agreement;







                                       22
<PAGE>

                (vi) you have caused material loss, damage or injury to  or
otherwise   endangered  the  property, reputation   or employees of Apple;

                (vii)      you  have engaged in malfeasance, negligence  or
misconduct,  or  failed  to perform reasonable duties  and responsibilities
consistent with your fiduciary duties and responsibilities to Apple; or

                (viii)     you  have  failed  to  act  in  accordance  with
specific,    reasonable    and    lawful    instructions    from    Apple's
Chief Executive Officer, or his delegate.

      12.   Right to Advice of Counsel.  Diery understands that he has  the
right  to have this Agreement reviewed by his lawyer and acknowledges  that
Apple  has  encouraged him to consult with his lawyer so that he  is  fully
aware   of  his  rights  and  obligations  under  this  Agreement.    Diery
acknowledges that he has done so.

      13.   Modification.   This Agreement may not  be  amended,  modified,
changed or discharged in any respect except as agreed in writing and signed
by Diery and the Chief Executive Officer of Apple Computer, Inc.

     14.  Severability and Interpretation.  In the event that any provision
or  any  portion  of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable  by  a
court of competent jurisdiction, such provision or portion thereof shall be
considered separate and apart from the remainder of this Agreement and  the
other  provisions shall remain fully valid and enforceable, provided  that,
if paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 19 and 21 are held to be invalid or unenforceable in
response  to a motion, argument or other act by Diery, then Apple,  at  its
sole  discretion,  may rescind the Agreement and recover all  consideration
paid to Diery under the Agreement.

      15.   Notices.  All notices required by this Agreement shall by given
in  writing  either  by personal delivery or by first  class  mail,  return
receipt requested.  Notices shall be addressed as follows:

     To Apple: Apple Computer, Inc.
               1 Infinite Loop, Mail Stop 38-I
               Cupertino, California 95014
               Attention:  General Counsel

     To Diery : 4175 Woodside Road
                Woodside, California 94062


or  in  each case to such other address as Diery or Apple shall notify  the
other.   Notice given by mail shall be deemed given five (5) days following
the date of mailing.

      16.   Miscellaneous.  The rights and obligations of Apple under  this
Agreement  shall  inure to the benefit of and shall  be  binding  upon  the
present  and  future subsidiaries of Apple, any and all subsidiaries  of  a
subsidiary,  all  affiliated corporations, and successors  and  assigns  of
Apple.  No assignment of this Agreement by Apple will relieve Apple of  its
obligations.   Diery shall not assign any of his rights and/or  obligations
under this Agreement and any such attempted assignment will be void.   This
Agreement shall be binding upon Diery heirs, executors, administrators,  or
other legal representatives and their legal assigns.

      17.   Damage  Limitation.  At Termination Date, Diery  shall  not  be
entitled  to  recover  any  compensation, benefits  or  damages  except  as
specifically described in this Agreement.  This damage waiver provides that
no  damages (including without limitation, special, consequential, general,
liquidated or punitive damages) shall be sought or due from Apple.

      18.   Waiver.   A  waiver by either party of  any  of  the  terms  or
conditions  of  this  Agreement in any instance  shall  not  be  deemed  or
construed  to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future,  or  of
any   subsequent  breach  thereof.   All  remedies,  rights,  undertakings,
obligations, and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be cumulative
and  none  of  them  shall  be in limitation of any  other  remedy,  right,
undertaking, obligation or agreement of either party.

     19.  Release.  Diery hereby completely releases and forever discharges
Michael  Spindler,  Apple,  its  officers,  directors,  agents,  employees,
attorneys,  insurers, subsidiaries and affiliates ("Apple  Parties")  from,
and  covenants  not  to sue any Apple Party with respect  to,  all  claims,
rights,  demands,  actions,  obligations, debts,  sums  of  money,  damages
(including  but  not limited to general, special, punitive, liquidated  and
compensatory  damages)  and  causes of action of  every  kind,  nature  and
character,  known  and  unknown, in law or equity, connected  with  Diery's
employment  relationship  with  the Apple Parties,  or  any  other  act  or
omission of any Apple Party which may have occurred prior to the date  this
Agreement  is  signed.   Diery further agrees that by  his  acceptance  and
negotiation of the payment provided for in paragraph (4) of this Agreement,
he   thereby  completely releases and forever discharges the Apple  Parties
from, and covenants not to sue any Apple Party with respect to, all claims,
rights,  demands,  actions,  obligations, debts,  sums  of  money,  damages
(including  but  not limited to general, special, punitive, liquidated  and
compensatory  damages)  and  causes of action of  every  kind,  nature  and
character,  known  and  unknown, in law or equity, connected  with  Diery's
employment relationship with the Apple Parties, or the termination of  such
relationship,  or any other act or omission of any Apple  Party  which  may
have  occurred  prior  to  Termination Date.  This  release  and  discharge
includes,  but  is  not  limited to, all "wrongful discharge"  claims;  all
claims  relating  to any contracts of employment express  or  implied;  any
covenant of good faith and fair dealing express or implied; any tort of any
nature:  any federal, state, or municipal statute or ordinance; any  claims
under  the  California Fair Employment and Housing Act, Title  VII  of  the
Civil  Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, and any other  laws  and
regulations  relating to employment discrimination and any and  all  claims
for  attorney's fees and costs.  Diery specifically acknowledges  that  the
foregoing  release includes a complete release and discharge of  all  Apple
Parties  from  any  and  all claims, damages of any kind,  and  claims  for
attorneys fees and costs, under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of
1967  ("ADEA")  as  amended  by  the Older Worker  Benefit  Protection  Act
("OWBPA").  Diery and Apple agree that part of the consideration payable to
Diery  under this Agreement is consideration that Diery would not otherwise
be  entitled to and is in consideration for Diery's release of claims under
the ADEA as amended by the OWBPA.

     Diery acknowledges that he understands the protections provided by the
OWBPA  and that the provisions of the OWBPA have been met by the  terms  of
this Agreement.  Diery states that he knowingly and voluntarily enters into
this  Agreement.  Diery acknowledges that this Agreement is  written  in  a
manner calculated to be understood by him. Diery further acknowledges  that
this   Agreement  refers  without  limitation  to  rights  under  the   Age
Discrimination  in  Employment  Act.   Diery  understands  that   by   this
Agreement, he does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date
the  Agreement  is executed.  Diery acknowledges that he is  entering  this
Agreement in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to
which  he  already is entitled due to his employment with Apple.   Further,
Diery  acknowledges  that this release of claims under  the  OWBPA  is  not
requested  in connection with an exit incentive program or other employment
termination  program  offered to a group or class of employees  within  the
meaning  of  OWBPA. Diery acknowledges that he has been allowed  up  to  21
(twenty-one) days from the date that he received this Agreement  to  accept
its  terms.  Diery acknowledges he has consulted with an attorney about the
Agreement.  Diery acknowledges that after he signs the Agreement,  he  will
then  be  given  seven (7) days following the date on which  he  signs  the
Agreement  to revoke it and that this Agreement will only become  effective
after this seven (7) day period has lapsed.  Any such revocation must be in
writing  signed  by  Diery  and immediately delivered  to  Apple's  General
Counsel.

      Diery  has  read and expressly waives Section 1542 of the  California
Civil Code, which provides as follows:

      A  GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR  DOES
NOT  KNOW  OR  SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF  EXECUTING  THE
RELEASE,  WHICH  IF  KNOWN  BY HIM  MUST HAVE  MATERIALLY  AFFECTED  HIS
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

     This waiver is not a mere recital, but is a known waiver of rights and
benefits.   This  is  a bargained-for provision of this  Agreement  and  is
further consideration for the covenants and conditions contained herein.

      The  Apple  Parties hereby release and forever discharge  Diery,  his
agents  and  attorneys from, and covenant not to sue Diery, his agents  and
attorneys   with   respect  to,  all  claims,  rights,  demands,   actions,
obligations, debts, sums of money, damages, and causes of action ("claims")
arising from his employment relationship with Apple to the extent permitted
by  law  and  public  policy,  except  for  any  claims  arising  from  any
intentional  acts of misconduct, or any other act taken  in  bad  faith  or
without a reasonable belief that it was in the best interests of the  Apple
Parties.





                                       24

     20.  Cooperation.  Diery agrees that at all times he will make himself
available,  for  such  amounts  of time as Apple's  General  Counsel  shall
reasonably deem necessary, to participate in the conduct of and preparation
for any pending or future litigation to which Apple is a party and in which
his experience or knowledge may be relevant.  Diery shall be reimbursed for
reasonable  travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred  by  virtue  of  his
cooperation  as  described in this paragraph.  In  no  respect  shall  this
provision  be  deemed to pertain to or affect the nature  or  substance  of
Diery  testimony at deposition or trial or in any other truthful  testimony
at deposition or trial or in any other circumstances.

     21.  Remedies in Event of Future Dispute.

           a.    Except as provided in subparagraph (b) below, in the event
of  any  future  dispute, controversy or claim between the parties  arising
from  or  relating to this Agreement, its breach, any matter  addressed  by
this  Agreement,  and/or Diery's employment with Apple through  Termination
Date,  the  parties  will  first attempt to  resolve  the  dispute  through
confidential mediation to be conducted in San Francisco by a member of  the
firm  of  Gregoria,  Haldeman & Piazza, Mediated Negotiations,  625  Market
Street,  Suite  400,  San  Francisco, California 94105.   If  the  parties'
dispute  is  not  resolved through mediation, it will be  resolved  through
binding   confidential  arbitration  to  be  conducted  by  the    American
Arbitration  Association  in  San Francisco,  pursuant  to  its  Commercial
Arbitration   Rules,  and  judgment  upon  the  award   rendered   by   the
Arbitrator(s)  may  be  entered by any court  having  jurisdiction  of  the
matter.   The  prevailing party in such arbitration shall  be  entitled  to
recover  from the losing party, not only the amount of any judgment awarded
in  its  favor,  but  also  any and all costs  and  expenses,  incurred  in
arbitrating the dispute or in preparing for such arbitration.

           b.    In  the  event that a dispute arises concerning compliance
with  this Agreement, either party will be entitled to obtain from a  court
with  jurisdiction  over the parties preliminary and  permanent  injunctive
relief  to enjoin or restrict the other party from such breach or to enjoin
or  restrict  a  third  party  from inducing any  such  breach,  and  other
appropriate  relief, including money damages.  In seeking any such  relief,
however,  the  moving  party will retain the right to  have  any  remaining
portion of the controversy resolved by binding confidential arbitration  in
accordance with subparagraph (a) above.

     By signing the below, the parties agree to the terms hereof, including
the  Exhibits hereto, and agree that this document, and Exhibits A,  B,  C,
and D hereto, sets forth their entire agreement.

                                   APPLE COMPUTER, INC.
