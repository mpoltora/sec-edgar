             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results have been included.  All adjustments are  of  a  normal
   recurring nature unless specified in a separate note included  in  these
   Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The results  for  interim
   periods  are  not necessarily indicative of results to be  expected  for
   the  entire year.  These financial statements and notes should  be  read
   in   conjunction  with  the  Company's  annual  consolidated   financial
   statements  and  the notes thereto for the fiscal year  ended  September
   29,  1995, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   September 29, 1995 (the "1995 Form 10-K").

2. In  the  second  quarter  of 1996, the Company announced  and  began  to
   implement  a  restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs  and  restoring
   profitability to the Company's operations.  The restructuring  plan  was
   necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the  Company's
   adoption  of  a  new  strategic direction.  The Company's  restructuring
   actions  consist primarily of terminating approximately 2,800  full-time
   employees  (not including employees who will be hired by  the  purchaser
   of  one  of  the Company's domestic manufacturing facilities), canceling
   or  vacating  certain  facility leases as a  result  of  these  employee
   terminations, writing down operating assets to be sold as  a  result  of
   downsizing  operations  and outsourcing various  operational  functions,
   and canceling contracts as a result of terminating e-world(TM), Apple's 
   on-line service.  These actions have resulted in a charge of $207 million,
   including  cash  expenditures of $24 million and non-cash  asset  write-
   downs  of  $2  million, during the second quarter.  The Company  expects
   that  the remaining $181 million accrued balance at March 29, 1996  will
   result in cash expenditures of $123 million over the next 12 months  and
   $12   million  thereafter.   The  Company  expects  that  most  of   the
   contemplated  restructuring actions will be completed  within  the  next
   twelve months and will be financed through current working capital,  the
   sale  of certain long-term assets and investments, possible future short
   and  long  term  borrowings,  and  possible  combined  debt  and  equity
   financing.

   The following table depicts the restructuring activity during the second
   quarter of 1996: (In millions)

4. The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily of  U.S.  Government
   securities,  Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper with  maturities
   of   three   months  or  less  at  the  date  of  purchase.   Short-term
   investments  consist principally of Euro-dollar deposits and  commercial
   paper  with  maturities between three and twelve months.  The  Company's
   marketable  equity  securities  consist of  securities  issued  by  U.S.
   corporations  and  are included in "Other assets"  on  the  accompanying
   balance  sheet.  The Company's cash equivalents, short-term investments,
   and  marketable  equity securities are classified and accounted  for  as
   available-for-sale,    and   the   cash   equivalents   and   short-term
   investments are generally held until maturity.   The Company's cash  and
   cash  equivalent balance includes $90 million  pledged as collateral  to
   support short-term borrowings.

   The  adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding
   gains  (losses)  on available-for-sale cash equivalents  and  short-term
   investments were not material, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   at  March 29, 1996.  The net adjustment recorded to shareholders' equity
   for  unrealized  holding  gains (losses) related  to  marketable  equity
   securities was an unrealized gain of approximately $9 million  at  March
   29, 1996.  The realized gains (losses) recorded to earnings on sales  of
   available-for-sale securities, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   were not material for the three and six months ended March 29, 1996.

5. U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $407
   million  of  undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's  foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested  in  operations  outside of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely  invested earnings, the Company provides  for  federal  and
   state  income  taxes  currently  on undistributed  earnings  of  foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The  Internal  Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal  income  tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company  has  made
   certain   prepayments  thereon.   The  Company  contested  the  proposed
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues  in
   dispute  for these years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the  IRS
   issued  a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of  the
   Company's  federal  income taxes for the years 1989 through  1991.   The
   Company  has  filed  a  petition with the United  States  Tax  Court  to
   contest  these  alleged  tax  deficiencies.   Management  believes  that
   adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments  that  may  result
   from these tax examinations.

   Deferred  tax assets resulting from the net loss incurred in  the  first
   six  months of 1996 loss are realizable based on the ability  to  offset
   existing deferred tax liabilities.

6. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options  outstanding  during the period.  Loss  per  share  is  computed
   using  the  weighted average number of common shares outstanding  during
   the period.

7. Certain prior year amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash  Flows
   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

8. No  dividend has been declared for the second quarter of 1996,  and  the
   Board  of  Directors  anticipates that for the  foreseeable  future  the
   Company  will  retain  any  earnings for use in  the  operation  of  its
   business.

Overview

The  Company has recently experienced a significant decline in  both  units
shipped  and share of the personal computer market.  For the quarter  ended
March  29,  1996,  the number of the Company's Macintosh computers  shipped
worldwide declined by 14% when compared with  the corresponding quarter  of
1995.   Moreover, according to an industry source, the Company's  share  of
the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.8% and 7.3%,
respectively,  for  the  quarter ended March 29,  1996.   This  decline  in
demand, coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry, has
resulted  in  the Company's decision to develop and recently  announce  key
elements  of  a  new strategic direction intended to improve the  Company's
competitiveness  and  restore its profitability.  The  Company  intends  to
develop  and  market  products and services more  selectively  targeted  to
education,  home  and business segments.  In moving in this  new  strategic
direction,  the  Company  expects  to reduce  the  number  of  new  product
introductions and the number of products in certain categories  within  its
current product portfolio.

and  printers.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased  14%  in  the
second  quarter  when  compared  with the corresponding  quarter  of  1995,
primarily  as  a result of a decline in worldwide demand for  most  product
families,  primarily  entry  level products, due  principally  to  customer
concerns  regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial  condition
and future prospects.  The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer
unit   decreased  1%  in  the  second  quarter  when  compared   with   the
corresponding quarter of 1995, primarily due to pricing actions across  all
product  lines  in  order  to  stimulate demand,  substantially  offset  by
increased  revenues  from a shift in the mix towards  the  Company's  newer
products  and products with multi-media configurations, which  have  higher
average selling prices.

Net sales for the first six months of 1996 decreased when compared with the
first  six months of 1995, resulting from a decrease in peripheral  product
net sales such as displays and printers, partially offset by an increase in
Macintosh computer net sales.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales did  not
change   in  the  first  six  months  of  1996,  when  compared  with   the
corresponding  periods of 1995.  Unit sales increased in the first  quarter
of  1996  when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 due to  unit
sales  increases  within  the  PowerMacintosh(TM) and  Performa (registered 
trademark) families  of desktop personal computers, and were offset by unit
sales  decreases  in  the second  quarter of 1996  when  compared  with the 
corresponding quarter of 1995 as discussed in the preceding paragraph.  The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh  computer  unit increased 4% in the 
first six months of 1996,  when compared  with  the corresponding period of 
1995, primarily due to increased  revenues  from a shift in the mix towards 
the Company's newer products  and products with multi-media configurations, 
which  have  higher  average  selling  prices,  partially offset by pricing 
actions across all  product  lines  in order to stimulate demand.

International  net  sales  decreased 11% and increased  4%  in  the  second
quarter and first six months of 1996, respectively, when compared with  the
corresponding  periods  of  1995. The decrease in  the  second  quarter  is
primarily  attributable  to a decrease in net sales  in  Europe  due  to  a
decrease in total Macintosh computer unit sales, partially offset by higher
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit, and to a decrease in
net  sales in Japan due to a decrease in the average aggregate revenue  per
Macintosh  computer unit.  The increase in the first six  months  primarily
reflects  strong  net  sales growth in Japan and certain  countries  within
Europe  during  the  first  quarter  of  1996.   International  net   sales
represented 59% and 54% of total net sales for the second quarter and first
six  months  of  1996,  respectively, compared with 54%  and  51%  for  the
corresponding   periods  of  1995.   Domestic  net   sales   decreased   by
approximately  26%  and 9% in the second quarter and first  six  months  of
1996, respectively, when compared with the corresponding periods of 1995.

The  Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis.
Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on
changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ("backlog") can be, and  often
are,  canceled  at  will.   The Company attempts  to  fill  orders  on  the
requested delivery schedules.  The Company's backlog increased slightly  to
approximately $369 million at May 3, 1996, from approximately $365  million
at February 2, 1996.  This increase in backlog relects the effect of delays
in  shipments  to  address quality problems with respect to  certain  entry
level,  Performa and Powerbook products, substantially offset by satisfying
product  backlog in other categories.  The Company estimates  that  product
backlog would have declined to approximately $220 million at May 3, 1996 if
the above-noted delays had not occurred.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of  its  future
business prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation
of  or  immediately following introduction of new products because of over-
ordering  by  dealers  anticipating shortages.  Backlog  often  is  reduced
sharply  once  dealers  and customers believe they  can  obtain  sufficient
supply.   Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of
the  Company's  ability  to  achieve any particular  level  of  revenue  or
financial performance.

The  Company  believes that net sales will remain below prior years  levels
through the first quarter of 1997.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and
its  cost  of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the  sale  of
products is influenced in significant part by the price set by the  Company
for  its products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold
is  based  primarily  on the cost of components and, to  a  lesser  extent,
direct labor costs.   Because the Company uses some components that are not
common  to  the  rest of the personal computer industry (including  certain
ASICs),  its  component costs may be higher than those  incurred  by  other
manufacturers.   The  type and cost of components  included  in  particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and  disk  drives)
are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations
competitive with other manufacturers.  Competition in the personal computer
industry  is intense, and, in the short term, frequent changes  in  pricing
and   product  configuration  are  often  necessary  in  order  to   remain
competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be
significantly  influenced in the short term by actions  undertaken  by  the
Company in response to industrywide competitive pressures.

Gross  margin decreased to (19.3%) and 1.0% during the second  quarter  and
first   six   months  of  1996,  respectively,  when  compared   with   the
corresponding  periods of 1995, primarily as a result  of  a  $616  million
charge  in  the  second quarter of 1996 principally for the  write-down  of
certain  inventory, as well as the cost to cancel excess component  orders,
necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for  many  of  the
Company's products, primarily its entry level products.  Also, the  Company
separately  incurred a $60 million charge that reflects the estimated  cost
to  correct  certain quality problems in certain entry level, Performa  and
Powerbook  products,  covering both goods held  in  inventory  and  shipped
goods.   In  addition, gross margins were adversely affected by  aggressive
pricing  actions  in  Japan, primarily in the first  quarter  of  1996,  in
response  to  extreme competitive actions by other companies attempting  to
gain  market share, and pricing actions in the U.S. and Europe  across  all
product lines in order to stimulate demand.

The  decrease  in gross margin levels in the second quarter and  first  six
months of 1996 compared with the corresponding periods of 1995 was slightly
offset by hedging gains less the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative
to  certain  foreign  currencies.   The Company's  operating  strategy  and
pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the  short
term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Although  the  Company is taking actions to improve  gross  margins  as  it
implements  its  new strategic plan, it is anticipated that  gross  margins
will  continue to remain under pressure and will remain below prior  years'
levels  through  at least the third quarter of 1996 due  to  a  variety  of
factors,  including  continued  industrywide pricing  pressures,  increased
competition,  compressed product life cycles, and the need to sell  through
current inventory at prices reflecting the recent write-downs.

Research  and development expenditures increased in the second quarter  and
first  six  months of 1996 when compared with the corresponding periods  of
1995, primarily due to higher project and headcount related spending as the
Company  continues  to  invest  in  the development  of  new  products  and
technologies.   The  increase as a percentage of net sales  in  the  second
quarter  when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 was primarily
a result of the decrease in the level of net sales.

As  part  of  the Company's restructuring plan and new strategic direction,
the  Company expects to reduce the number of employees engaged in  research
and  development activities and to streamline its product offerings.  As  a
result, the Company expects that research and development expenditures will
decrease relative to historical levels.  Nevertheless, the Company believes
that continued investments in research and development are critical to  its
future  growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly
related to continued, timely development of new and enhanced products.  The
Company  believes a greater portion of its research and development efforts
will  be conducted through collaborations with third parties.  In addition,
where  appropriate  the Company plans to acquire and  license  technologies
from third parties.

Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses  increased  in  the  second
quarter  and  first six months of 1996 when compared with the corresponding
periods  of  1995 primarily due to increased spending related to  marketing
and advertising programs.  The increase as a percentage of net sales in the
second  quarter when compared with the corresponding quarter  of  1995  was
primarily a result of the decrease in the level of net sales.

As  a  result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that  selling,
general   and   administrative  expenditures  will  decrease  relative   to
historical levels, although marketing and advertising expenses are expected
to  remain high relative to historical levels during the remainder of  1996
as the Company attempts to stimulate greater demand for its products.

In  the  first  quarter of 1995, the Company lowered its estimates  of  the
total  remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan initiated  in
the  third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased income
by $17 million.

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased to income from  expense
in  the  second quarter and first six months of 1996 when compared  to  the
corresponding periods in 1995, primarily due to favorable variances related
to  realized  and unrealized foreign exchange hedging gains (losses)  as  a
result  of  less volatility in the foreign exchange markets in  the  second
quarter  of  1996  as  compared to the second quarter of  1995,  offset  by
unfavorable  variances in interest income and expense related primarily  to
higher  borrowing  costs, due to the downgradings of the  Company's  credit
ratings by external credit rating agencies, and due to the decrease in cash
and  short-term investment balances during the second quarter and first six
months  of  1996 as compared with the corresponding periods in  1995.   The
Company's  cost  of  funds  has  increased  as  a  result  of  the   recent
downgradings  of  its  short-term debt to NP  and  C  by  Moody's  Investor
Services  and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively, and  of  its
long-term debt to Ba2 and B+ by Moody's Investor Services and Standard  and
Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on  the Company's ability to successfully develop,  manufacture,
and  market  technologically innovative products in order to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future  operating  results and financial condition.   Potential  risks  and
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results  and
financial  condition  include,  without limitation:  continued  competitive
pressures  in the marketplace; the effect any reaction to such  competitive
pressures has on inventory levels and inventory valuations; the effects  of
significant  adverse publicity; the impact of uncertainties concerning  the
Company's  strategic  direction  and financial  condition  on  revenue  and
liquidity;  the effect of continued degradation in the Company's liquidity;
and the effect of restructuring actions.

The  Company  expects  to incur operating losses throughout  at  least  the
remainder of 1996.

Restructuring of Operations

In  the  second  quarter of 1996, the Company formulated  a  new  strategic
direction and announced certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its
cost  structure, improving its competitiveness and restoring profitability.
There are several risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition  to
a  new cost structure.  These include the risk that the Company will not be
able  to  reduce  expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability  and
improve  liquidity and the risk that cost-cutting initiatives  will  impair
the  Company's ability to innovate and remain competitive in  the  computer
industry.

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company intends to implement a new
business model.  Implementation of the new business model involves  several
risks,  including the risk that by simplifying its product line the Company
will  increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce overall
sales  and  increase  its  reliance on unproven  products  and  technology.
Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing the proportion
of  the  Company's products to be produced under outsourcing  arrangements,
the  Company could lose control of the quality of the products manufactured
and lose the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules  in
order  to  respond  to changing market conditions.  In  addition,  the  new
business model could adversely affect employee morale, thereby damaging the
Company's ability to retain and motivate employees.  Also, because the  new
business  model contemplates that the Company will reduce its research  and
development  expenditures  by, among other things,  relying  to  a  greater
extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties,  the
Company  will  have less direct control over its research  and  development
efforts  and its ability to create innovative new products may be  reduced.
Finally, even if the new business model is successfully implemented,  there
can  be  no  assurance that it will effectively resolve the various  issues
currently  facing the Company.  In addition, although the Company  believes
that  the action that it is taking under its restructuring plan should help
restore marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can  be  no
assurance that such actions will succeed.

For  the  foregoing  reasons  there can be no assurance  that  the  current
restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will
not  be required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and
financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected  should  it  encounter
difficulty  in  effectively managing the transition to  the  new   business
model and cost structure.

For   more  information  regarding  the  Company's  restructuring   actions
initiated  in the second quarter of 1996, refer to Note 2 of the  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item  I,  and  to
Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's  ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the  availability of application software for new products,  the  effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the
manufacturing  of  products in appropriate quantities to  meet  anticipated
demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in
the   early  stages  of  introduction.   Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot
determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its  sales  or
results of operations.  In addition, the uncertainties and risks associated
with  new  product  introductions may be  increased  as  a  result  of  the
Company's new business model which will, in part, emphasize a refocusing of
product  offerings  and  the introduction of new products  for  key  growth
segments.

The  rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new
product  is  not necessarily an indication of the future rate of  shipments
for  that  product, which depends on many factors, some of  which  are  not
under  the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to  purchase
new  technology  prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users  ("early
adopters");  purchases  in  satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by  users  who
anticipated  new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases  of  other
products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to  the
aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,
such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many users until new technology  is
accepted  as  "proven"  and for which commonly used software  products  are
available;  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they  believe  they
can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in backlog.

Backlog  is  often  volatile after new product  introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned   demand   factors,  often  increasingly   coincident   with
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers  believe  they
can obtain sufficient supply of products.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability  of  European-language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial  demand for the Company's new products  outside  the  United
States,  even  though localized versions of the Company's products  may  be
available.

The  greater integration of functions and complexity of operations  of  the
Company's  products  also increase the risk that latent  defects  or  other
faults  could  be  discovered by customers or end-users  after  volumes  of
products  have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant,
the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product
warranties.
                            
Competition

The  personal  computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized
by  aggressive  pricing  practices, downward  pressure  on  gross  margins,
frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual
improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity
on  the part of consumers and a large number of competitors.  In the  first
six  months  of  1996,  the Company's results of operations  and  financial
condition  were,  and  in  the near future are expected  to  be,  adversely
affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on  gross
margins.   The  industry has also been characterized by rapid technological
advances  in  software functionality and hardware performance and  features
based  on  existing or emerging industry standards.  Some of the  Company's
competitors   have   greater   financial,  marketing,   manufacturing   and
technological  resources,  broader  product  lines  and  larger   installed
customer bases than those of the Company.

The  Company's  future  operating results and financial  condition  may  be
affected  by  overall  demand for personal computers and  general  customer
preferences  for  one platform over another or one set of product  features
over another.

On  November  7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with  International
Business  Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware
reference  platform  for the PowerPC microprocessor  that  is  intended  to
deliver a much wider range of operating system and application choices  for
computer  customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company is  moving
forward  with its efforts to make the Macintosh operating system  available
on  the  common platform.  In line with its efforts, on November 13,  1995,
the  Company,  IBM,  and Motorola, Inc. announced the availability  of  the
"PowerPC  Platform"  specifications,  which  define  a  "unified"  personal
computer architecture and combine the Power Macintosh platform and  the  PC
environment.   Accordingly,  the Company's  future  operating  results  and
financial condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement
this  agreement  and to manage the risk associated with the  transition  to
this new hardware reference platform.

The  Company  is  currently the primary maker of  hardware  that  uses  the
Macintosh  operating system ("Mac OS").  The Mac OS has a  minority  market
share  in  the  personal computer market, which is dominated by  makers  of
computers that run the MS-DOS(registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows(TM) 
operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived
advantages over MS-DOS  and  Windows, has been a driving force behind sales 
of  the  Company's personal  computer hardware  for the past several years.  
Recent innovations in  the  Windows platform, including those introduced by 
Windows  95,  have added features  to the Windows platform similar to those 
offered by the  Mac OS.   The Company is currently taking and will continue
to take steps  to respond  to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows
platform.   The company's future operating  results and financial condition 
may be  affected by  its  ability to  increase  the installed  base for the 
Macintosh platform. As  part of its efforts to increase the  installed base
for the  Macintosh platform,  the  Company announced the  licensing of  the  
Mac  OS  to  other personal  computer vendors in  January 1995, and several 
vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh operating system.   
The Company believes  that  licensing the operating system will  result  in
a broader installed  base on which software vendors can develop and provide
technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  However, there can be no 
assurance that the installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the 
operating system  or  that  licensing  will  result in an increase  in  the  
number  of application  software  titles or the rate at which vendors  will
bring  to market application software based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as 
a result of licensing its operating system, the Company is forced to compete
with other  companies producing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits
to the  Company  from licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than
offset by the disadvantages of being required to compete with them.
                                        
As  a  supplemental  means of addressing the competition  from  MS-DOS  and
Windows,  the  Company has devoted substantial resources toward  developing
personal computer products capable of running application software designed
for  the  MS-DOS or Windows operating systems ("Cross-Platform  Products").
These  products include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601 microprocessor  and
the  486  DX2/66  microprocessor, which enable users  to  run  concurrently
applications  that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1  or  Windows  95
operating  systems.  The Company has announced that it intends to  ship  by
June  1996  Cross-Platform Products that include the Pentium  or  586-class
chip,  or  in which a Pentium or 586-class microprocessor can be  installed
through the use of an add-on card.

The  Company plans to supply customers who purchase Cross-Platform Products
with  operating system software under licensing agreements with  Microsoft.
The  Company's prior licensing agreement with Microsoft expired on December
31,  1995.  The Company recently entered into new licensing agreements with
Microsoft that will permit the Company to distribute MS-DOS and permit  the
Company  to  acquire  the  rights to distribute certain  Windows  operating
systems,  including Windows 95.  In order to distribute  Windows  operating
systems,  the  Company will need to enter into one or more agreements  with
certain Microsoft distributors.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed  to  MS-DOS  or  Windows-based systems,  are  often  based  on  the
availability  of  third-party  software for particular  applications.   The
Company  believes that the availability of third-party application software
for  the  Company's  hardware products depends in part on  the  third-party
developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing,
maintaining  and upgrading such software for the Company's products  versus
software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is  based
on  factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products,
the  anticipated  potential revenue that may be earned, and  the  costs  of
developing  such  software products.  To the extent  the  Company's  recent
financial  losses have caused software developers to question the Company's
position  in  the personal computer market, they could be less inclined  to
develop  new  application  software or upgrade existing  software  for  the
Company's  products  and  more inclined to devote  their  resources  toward
developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.
Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of application software for
the  Company's  products.  Accordingly, Microsoft's interest  in  producing
application  software  for  the Company's products  may  be  influenced  by
Microsoft's  perception  of  its interests as the  vendor  of  the  Windows
operating systems.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
PowerPC  RISC  microprocessor for certain of  the  Company's  products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors that  produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by  most personal computers  using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  Intel
microprocessors   as   well   as  workstations   based   on   the   PowerPC
microprocessor,  and  is also the developer of OS/2, a competing  operating
system  to  the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying
the  Company  with   microprocessors for  the  Company's  products  may  be
influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer
of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.

Recently,  several competitors of the Company, including  Compaq,  IBM  and
Microsoft,  have  either targeted or announced their  intention  to  target
certain  of  the  Company's key market segments,  including  education  and
publishing.   Some  of  these companies have greater financial,  marketing,
manufacturing and technological resources than the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize  on
its investments in other markets, such as the markets for Internet services
and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.


Global Market Risks

A  large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international
operations.   As  a result, the Company's operations and financial  results
could  be significantly affected by international factors, such as  changes
in  foreign  currency  exchange rates or weak economic  conditions  in  the
foreign  markets in which the Company distributes its products.   When  the
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value  of
non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens,  the
U.S.    dollar   value   of   non-U.S.   dollar-based   sales    increases.
Correspondingly,  the  U.S.  dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based  costs
increases  when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S.  dollar
strengthens.   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of  currencies  other
than  the  U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar  and  is
adversely  affected  by  a  stronger dollar relative  to  major  currencies
worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and  in  particular  a
strengthening  of  the  U.S. dollar, may negatively  affect  the  Company's
consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars).

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on
the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and
operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based
exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward
and option contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.  Currently,
hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The
Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain
other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,
but not firmly committed transactions currently do not extend beyond one
year.  To reduce the costs associated with these ongoing foreign exchange
hedging programs, the Company also regularly sells foreign exchange option
contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All
foreign
exchange forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges,
including all transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the
Company's foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and
are adjusted on each balance sheet date for
changes in exchange rates.

While  the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the  interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's  leading  industrialized  countries,  the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations  in
the  general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S.
interest  rates  affect  the interest earned on the  Company's  cash,  cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments as well as interest  paid  on  its
short-term  borrowings  and  long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into  interest
rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps are intended  to
better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash,  cash
equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest  rate
swap  and  option  transactions in order to  diversify  a  portion  of  the
Company's  exposure  away  from fluctuations in  short-term  U.S.  interest
rates.   These instruments may extend the Company's cash investment horizon
up to a maximum effective duration of three years.
                                        
To  ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange
and  interest  rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor  the  risks  and
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually  monitors
its  foreign  exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate
swap  and  option positions on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction  with
its  underlying  foreign  currency-  and interest  rate-related  exposures,
respectively,  from  both  an  accounting  and  an  economic   perspective.
However,  given  the  effective horizons of the Company's  risk  management
activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will
offset  more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting  from
unfavorable  movements in either foreign exchange or  interest  rates.   In
addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and  losses
related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide
with  the  timing  of  gains and losses related to the underlying  economic
exposures,  and  as  such,  may adversely affect  the  Company's  operating
results  and financial position.  The Company generally does not engage  in
leveraged hedging.

The  Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the  costs
of  its  hedging  transactions, as well as the willingness of  its  trading
partners to enter into hedging transactions with the Company.

Inventory and Supply

In  line  with  the Company's efforts to redesign its business  model,  the
Company intends to streamline its product offerings in its key usage  areas
in  education, business and the home.  This simplification of product lines
has  resulted in inventory reserves.   Cancellation fees related to  custom
component  inventory purchased for anticipated product  introductions  that
have  been canceled have also been paid or incurred.  The Company has  also
separately  provided  for  the estimated cost to  correct  certain  quality
problems on certain entry level, Performa and Powerbook products.  Although
the  Company  believes its inventory and related reserves are adequate,  no
assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory
charges.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory well
in  advance  of  product  shipments.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are
volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk
that   the  Company  will  forecast  incorrectly  and  produce  excess   or
insufficient  inventories of particular products.  The Company's  operating
results  and  financial  condition have been  and  may  in  the  future  be
materially  adversely  affected  by the Company's  ability  to  manage  its
inventory  levels  and  respond to short-term  shifts  in  customer  demand
patterns.
                                        
Certain  of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part  by
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of  the
Company  or  otherwise.  As a result of the Company's  restructuring  plan,
which  includes the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado  manufacturing
facility  to  SCI  Systems,  Inc.   ("SCI")  and  a  related  manufacturing
outsourcing  agreement  with SCI, the proportion of its  products  produced
under   outsourcing   arrangements  will   increase.    While   outsourcing
arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they may  also  reduce
the  direct  control  the  Company currently has over  production.   It  is
uncertain what effect such lessened control will have on the quality of the
products  manufactured  or the flexibility of the  Company  to  respond  to
changing  market  conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by  the  Company  to
manage  its  inventory  under outsourcing arrangements  could  subject  the
Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement.

Moreover,  although  arrangements  with  such  manufacturers  may   contain
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least
initially  responsible  to  the  ultimate consumer  for  warranty  service.
Accordingly,  in  the event of product defects or warranty  liability,  the
Company  may remain primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect  or
warranty   liability,  whether  pursuant  to  arrangements  with   contract
manufacturers  or  otherwise, could adversely affect the  Company's  future
operating results and financial condition.
                                        
The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited  by
the  availability  of  key  components.   The  Company  believes  that  the
availability   from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer   industry   of
microprocessors  and  ASICs  presents the most  significant  potential  for
constraining   the   Company's  ability  to  produce  products.    Specific
microprocessors  manufactured  by Motorola,  Inc.  and  IBM  are  currently
available only from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors are
currently  in  the  early stages of ramp-up for production  and  thus  have
limited  availability.   The Company and other producers  in  the  personal
computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with  other
industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to
either  increased  consumer demand or increased use  of  semiconductors  in
their  products  (such  as  the cellular phone and automotive  industries).
Finally,  the Company uses some components that are not common to the  rest
of  the  personal  computer industry (including certain ASICs).   Continued
availability  of  these components may be affected  if  producers  were  to
decide  to  concentrate on the production of common components  instead  of
components  customized  to meet the Company's requirements.   Such  product
supply  constraints  and corresponding increased costs could  decrease  the
Company's  market share and adversely affect the Company's future operating
results and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A  number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the
Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of distribution
is  through  third-party computer resellers.  The Company also  distributes
product through consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer
electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business  and
financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of
these resellers weakens or if resellers within consumer channels decide not
to continue to distribute the Company's products.

Uncertainty over the demand for the Company's products may cause  resellers
to  reduce the ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under the
Company's  arrangements with its resellers, resellers have  the  option  to
reduce  or  eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most  instances
without  financial  penalty.  Resellers also  have  the  option  to  return
products to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which
they  may  be  assessed fees.  In the second quarter of 1996,  the  Company
experienced a reduction in ordering from historical levels by resellers due
to uncertainty concerning the Company's condition.

Other Factors

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

Production  and marketing of products in certain states and  countries  may
subject  the Company to environmental and other regulations which  include,
in  some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with
the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life,
and  leave  responsibility for environmentally safe disposal  or  recycling
with  the  Company.  It is unclear what the effect of such regulation  will
have on the Company's future operating results and financial condition.
                                        
The  Company  is  currently  in  the  process  of  replacing  its  existing
transaction  systems  (which  include order management,  distribution,  and
finance)  with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort  to
increase  operational efficiency.  The Company's future  operating  results
and  financial  condition could be adversely affected  if  the  Company  is
unable  to  implement  and effectively manage the transition  to  this  new
integrated system.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.
                                        
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  Company's  financial position with respect to cash, cash  equivalents,
and short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings, decreased to $240
million  at March 29, 1996, from $491 million at September 29,  1995.   The
Company's  financial position with respect to cash, cash  equivalents,  and
short-term  investments decreased to $592 million at March 29,  1996,  from
$952 million at September 29, 1995.  The Company's cash and cash equivalent
balance  at  March  29,  1996 and September 29, 1995 includes  $90  million
pledged as collateral  to support short-term borrowings.

Cash  used for operations during the first six months of 1996 totaled  $177
million, primarily due to the net loss.  Also contributing to cash used for
operations  were  lower  accounts payable  levels,  due  to  a  substantial
reduction  in inventory purchases.  Cash used for operations was  partially
offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.
                                        
Net  cash  used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment  totaled
$40  million  in the first six months of 1996, and consisted  primarily  of
increases  in  manufacturing machinery and equipment  and  buildings.   The
Company expects that capital expenditures in 1996 will decline relative  to
1995 expenditure levels.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                       18
<PAGE>

Short-term  borrowings at March 29, 1996, were approximately  $109  million
lower  than  at September 29, 1995.  The issuance of commercial  paper  has
been  discontinued and short-term borrowings have largely ceased. On  March
29, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, entered into loan
agreements  in  the  aggregate amount of $146 million with  certain  banks,
which   extended  or  replaced  approximately  $146  million  of   existing
borrowings.  Also on this date, Apple Japan, Inc. repaid approximately  $54
million  of  existing  borrowings.  The current loans have  maturity  dates
ranging  from June 28, 1996 to September 30, 1996.  Two of these loans  are
guaranteed  by  the  Company.  On April 2, 1996,  Apple  Computer  B.V.,  a
subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement to extend its existing
$200 million secured credit facility.  The amount currently outstanding  is
approximately $190 million.  The facility matures on June 28, 1996  and  is
guaranteed  by the Company.  In connection with this facility, the  Company
has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance.

The Company's balance of long-term debt remained relatively constant during
the first six months of 1996.  Substantially the entire amount of long-term
borrowings  represents  $300 million aggregate  principal  amount  of  6.5%
unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration statement  filed
with   the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  1994.   This   shelf
registration was for the registration of debt and other securities  for  an
aggregate offering amount of $500 million.  The notes were sold at  99.925%
of  par,  for  an  effective yield to maturity of  6.51%.   The  notes  pay
interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984  through  1991, and  the  Company  has  made  certain
prepayments  thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies  for
the  years  1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for  these
years  have  been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a  notice  of
deficiency  proposing  increases to the amount  of  the  Company's  federal
income  taxes  for the years 1989 through 1991.  The Company  has  filed  a
petition  with  the  United States Tax Court to contest these  alleged  tax
deficiencies.   Management believes that adequate provision has  been  made
for any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

It  will be necessary for the Company to borrow in the near term to finance
its working capital needs, because the Company does not expect that it will
generate  cash  from  operations  in this  time  frame.   In  addition,  in
connection with the restructuring actions, referred to on page 6 in Note  2
of  the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had $24
million  of cash expenditures in the second quarter of 1996 and expects  to
incur  $123  million of cash expenditures over the next 12  months.   These
cash  expenditures  are  expected to be financed  through  current  working
capital, the sale of certain assets and other investments, possible  future
short  and  long-term  borrowings, and possible combined  debt  and  equity
financing.

As  noted  on  page  12  under the subheading "Interest  and  other  income
(expense), net",  the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result  of
the  recent  downgradings of its short-term debt to NP  and  C  by  Moody's
Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively,  and
of  its  long-term  debt  to Ba2 and B+ by Moody's  Investor  Services  and
Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In addition, the  Company
may be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain  of
its  borrowings and to agree to more stringent covenants than in the  past.
The  Company is seeking alternative sources of liquidity and is  discussing
various  alternatives  with several financial institutions.   Although  the
Company  believes it will be able to arrange short- and long-term financing
that  will  cover  its needs, it currently does not have  commitments  from
lenders to provide such funding.  The Company believes that its balances of
cash,  cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with possible
short-  and  long-term  borrowings and possible combined  debt  and  equity
financing  that  the Company believes it will be able to  obtain,  will  be
sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, including the impact of
planned  restructuring  actions,  on a  short-  and  long-term  basis.   No
assurance  can be given that the necessary financing will be  obtained,  or
that  any  additional financing that may be required if  the  restructuring
plan takes longer to implement than anticipated or is not successful can be
obtained.   If  the  Company is unable to obtain  adequate  financing,  its
liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be materially
adversely affected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Management  is  not  aware of any pending legal proceedings  to  which  the
Company is a party that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations as reported in  the
accompanying financial statements.

Reference is made to Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on
Form  10-Q  for the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 1995 for a discussion
of  certain purported shareholder class action suits filed in January 1996.
In  February  1996, the complaint in the action styled Abraham  and  Evelyn
Kostick  Trust v. Peter Crisp, et al. was amended to add additional parties
and to add purported class and derivative claims based on theories such  as
breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and insider trading.  In  March
1996,  a  purported  shareholder class action  styled  Derek  Pritchard  v.
Michael  Spindler, et al., was filed in the California Superior  Court  for
Santa  Clara County, alleging that the defendants breached their  fiduciary
duty by allegedly rejecting an offer from a computer company (not named  in
the  complaint)  to  acquire the Company at a price in excess  of  $50  per
share.

The  Company has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits (fewer than
100) in each of which the complaint alleges that the plaintiff incurred so-
called "repetitive stress injuries" to the upper extremities as a result of
using  keyboards  and/or mouse input devices sold by the Company.   All  of
these cases are in various stages of pre-trial activity.

The Company believes that all of the actions cited above are without merit.

                      Employment Agreement
                                
                                
Dear Dr. Amelio:

           The  following sets forth our agreement regarding the terms  and
provisions of your employment as an officer and employee of Apple Computer,
Inc.  (the  "Company") during the Term.  Capitalized words  which  are  not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words  in
Section 8 of this Agreement.

           1.    Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of  your
employment under this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on February  2,
1996  (the "Effective Date") and shall continue until the fifth anniversary
of  the  Effective Date.  For purposes of this Agreement,  "Contract  Year"
means each 12-month period during the term beginning on the Effective  Date
or  anniversary thereof, and "Fiscal Year" means the Company's fiscal year.
Subject  to  the provisions of Section 5 below, either party may  terminate
the Term at any time.

           2.   Employment During the Term.  During the Term, you shall  be
employed  as  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the  Company  and
shall  report  directly  to  the Board of Directors  of  the  Company  (the
"Board"),  and  your duties and responsibilities to the  Company  shall  be
consistent  in  all  respects with such positions.  During  the  Term,  the
Company  will  take  all  steps reasonably necessary  to  assure  that  you
continue  to  be  elected  or appointed to the  Board.   You  shall  devote
substantially  all  of your business time, attention,  skills  and  efforts
exclusively  to  the  business and affairs of the Company,  other  than  de
minimis  amounts of time devoted by you to the management of your  personal
finances  or to engaging in charitable or community services.   During  the
Term,  you shall be permitted to continue serving as a member of the boards
of  directors of the corporations on which you are serving as a director on
the  Effective  Date  (and on such other boards  of  directors  as  may  be
approved in writing from time to time by the Board) as long as such service
does not adversely affect the performance of your duties to the Company  as
contemplated  hereunder.  Your principal place of employment shall  be  the
executive offices of the Company as established from time to time, although
you  understand and agree that you will be required to travel from time  to
time for business purposes.
                                
                               23

          3.   Compensation During the Term.

           (a)   Base  Salary.   As compensation to you  for  all  services
rendered  to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company will pay  you  a
base  salary (the "Salary") at the rate of $990,000 per annum.  Your Salary
will  be  paid  to  you  in accordance with the Company's  regular  payroll
practices  applicable to its executive officers.  Your rate of Salary  will
be  reviewed annually by the Board and may be increased by the Board on the
basis of such review.

          (b)  Bonus.

          (i)  Annual Bonus.  You shall be eligible to earn an annual bonus
(the  "Annual Bonus") for each whole or partial Fiscal Year during the Term
consisting  of the sum of (i) the Component A Bonus (as defined below)  for
that Fiscal Year and (ii) the Component B Bonus (as defined below) for such
Fiscal  Year.   The Annual Bonus for each given Fiscal Year  will  be  paid
within  90  days following the end of the Fiscal Year to which such  Annual
Bonus  relates.   The "Component A Bonus" shall be based upon  the  Company
achieving  one or more performance goals established in good faith  by  the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") and approved  by  the
Board  for  such Fiscal Year.  The performance goal or goals applicable  to
the  Component A Bonus for the Fiscal Year of the Company that includes the
Effective  Date will be established within 60 days following the  Effective
Date. The performance goals for the Component A Bonus for subsequent Fiscal
Years will be established, to the extent practicable, prior to the start of
the  applicable  Fiscal Year, but in no event later than 90 days  following
the commencement of the Fiscal Year.  The target amount of your Component A
Bonus for each 12-month Fiscal Year will equal 100% of your annual rate  of
Salary based upon the rate in effect on the first day of that Fiscal  Year.
The  target  amount  for any Fiscal Year of fewer than 12  months  will  be
prorated by multiplying the target amount determined in accordance with the
previous  sentence  by  a  fraction (in no event  greater  than  one),  the
numerator  of which is the number of days in such Fiscal Year in  the  Term
and  the  denominator  of  which is 365 ( the "Proration  Fraction").   The
actual amount of the Component A Bonus paid to you for a given Fiscal  Year
(which,  for purposes of this Agreement, will be deemed earned  as  of  the
last  day of the applicable Fiscal Year) may range from 50% to 300% of  the
target  amount,  based  upon  a  performance schedule  established  by  the
Committee  for the applicable Fiscal Year and the relationship between  the
Company's actual performance for the Fiscal Year and the target performance
established  for  that  year  by the Committee (it  being  understood  that
payments  in excess of 200% of target will be made only for extraordinarily
good  corporate performance and payments of no Component A  Bonus  will  be
made  for  only  poor corporate performance); provided, however,  that  the
minimum Component A Bonus for the first Fiscal Year ending during the  Term
shall be 50% of the target amount for that Fiscal Year.  There shall be  no
minimum  guaranteed Component A Bonus for any Fiscal Year  other  than  the
first Fiscal Year ending during the Term.  The "Component B Bonus" shall be
$1,000,000 for each Fiscal Year of the Company ending during the Term (and,
for purposes of this Agreement, will be deemed earned as of the last day of
the  applicable Fiscal Year ending during the Term).  In no event  may  the
sum  of  the Component B Bonuses paid for all Fiscal Years during the  Term
exceed  $5  million. In the event that the Company changes its Fiscal  Year
during  the  Term,  an  equitable adjustment shall be  made  to  the  bonus
arrangement which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the  Committee,
preserves, to the extent practicable, the bonus opportunity (including  the
timing of payment of the Component B Bonuses) set forth above.

           (ii)  Signing  Bonus.  In addition to any amounts payable  under
Section  3(b)(i)  above, the Company will pay you as  soon  as  practicable
following the Effective Date a one-time signing bonus of $200,000.
                                
                               24

           (c)   Loan.    On or as soon as practicable after the  Effective
Date,  the  Company shall cause one of its subsidiaries (the  "Lender")  to
lend  you  the amount of $5,000,000 (the "Loan").  The Loan shall initially
be  made  to  you on a fully recourse basis but shall, subject  to  Section
5(h),  become  nonrecourse (and thereafter remain nonrecourse)  as  to  the
portion  of  the principal amount of the Loan that is secured by collateral
with a value on the date such collateral is pledged by you equal to 125% of
the  outstanding  principal amount of the Loan.  To  the  extent  that  the
collateral  pledged  by you does not have a value  equal  to  125%  of  the
outstanding  principal amount of the Loan, the portion  of  the  Loan  that
shall be recourse shall be determined in accordance with the formula  [P  -
(C/1.25)],  where "P" is the outstanding principal amount of the  Loan  and
"C" is the fair market value of all collateral securing the Loan determined
as  of  the  date such collateral is pledged.  The collateral that  may  be
pledged  by  you   to  secure the Loan shall consist of Performance  Shares
earned  by  you  and  such other collateral as the  Lender  may  reasonably
accept.  The Company agrees to release its security interest in Performance
Shares  prior to the full repayment of the Loan to the extent necessary  to
permit  you to sell such shares in order to pay the tax liability  incurred
by  you  in connection with your earning of the Performance Shares, to  pay
any  currently due interest on the Loan or to pay any outstanding principal
amount  of  the  Loan.  The Loan shall bear interest at  the  minimum  rate
necessary  to  avoid the imputation of interest under the  Code.   Interest
shall compound and be payable annually on each anniversary of the Effective
Date  and  on  the date of your termination or resignation  of  employment.
Twenty  per cent of the initial principal amount of the Loan shall  be  due
and  payable  on  each  of  the first through fifth  anniversaries  of  the
Effective  Date.  The entire principal amount of the Loan and  any  accrued
but  unpaid  interest on the Loan shall be immediately due and  payable  90
days  following the Date of Termination (as hereinafter defined).  You  may
prepay  some or all of the principal amount of the Loan and any portion  of
the accrued but unpaid interest on the Loan at any time without premium  or
penalty.  Repayments of principal and interest on the Loan shall be applied
ratably at the time of payment to the recourse and nonrecourse portions  of
the  Loan.  Following your termination or resignation of employment for any
reason,  the Company and the Lender shall have the unconditional  right  to
reduce  any  payments owed to you hereunder by the amount of  any  due  and
unpaid  principal and interest on the Loan and you hereby agree and consent
to such right on the part of the Company and the Lender.  As a condition to
making the Loan to you, you shall execute a promissory note in favor of the
Lender  and  any  other applicable Loan documentation consistent  with  the
terms of this Section 3(c) which is reasonably requested by the Lender.

           (d)   Benefits.   During  the Term, you  shall  be  eligible  to
participate  in all welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements  that
the  Company  provides to its executive employees in  accordance  with  the
terms  of such plans and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable  to
you,  in  the aggregate, than the terms and provisions available  to  other
executive  employees  of  the Company.  Subject  to  your  insurability  at
standard  commercial rates, in lieu of your participating in the  Company's
regular  life  insurance programs, the Company agrees to maintain  a  whole
life insurance policy for you during the Term with a death benefit equal to
5  times  your annual rate of Salary.  The whole life policy  shall  be  on
terms which are substantially similar to those applicable to the whole life
policy in effect with your prior employer (including the provisions thereof
applicable to the allocation of premiums on the policy between you and  the
Company).

          (e)  Expenses.  The Company will reimburse you in accordance with
its  regular  policies  and  practices  for  business  expenses  reasonably
incurred  by  you in connection with the performance of your  duties  under
this  Agreement, subject to your presentation of appropriate  documentation
of such expenses.

           (f)   Airplane Lease.  The Company agrees to lease your  current
airplane  for business purposes on terms which are commercially  reasonable
to you and the Company. The terms of such airplane lease will be negotiated
in  good faith by you and the Company after the Effective Date and will  be
memorialized in appropriate documentation.
                              25

           4.    Long-Term Incentive Compensation.  In order to align  your
interests  more  closely  with  those of the  Company's  stockholders,  the
Company   will   offer  the  following  long-term  incentive   compensation
arrangements to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

           (a)   Stock Option.  Subject to Section 4(c) below, as  soon  as
practicable  after  the  Effective Date, the  Company  will  grant  to  you
pursuant  to  the Apple Computer, Inc. 1990 Stock Option Plan (the  "Option
Plan")  a  stock option (the "Option") covering 1,000,000 shares of  common
stock of the Company (the "Common Stock").  The per share exercise price of
the Option shall be the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the
day  before  the  date the Option is granted to you by  the  Committee,  as
determined  in  accordance with the provisions of  the  Option  Plan.   The
Option  shall  become vested and exercisable with respect  to  20%  of  the
shares  of Common Stock subject thereto on the Initial Vesting Date and  on
each  of  the  second  through fifth anniversaries of the  Effective  Date,
provided that you have remained in the continuous full-time employ  of  the
Company  through  each such vesting date and stockholder  approval  of  the
grant of the Option is obtained in accordance with Section 4(c) below.  The
Option  will be subject to the terms and provisions of the Option Plan  and
such  other  terms  consistent with the Option Plan as  the  Committee  may
specify and set forth in the applicable Option Agreement.

          (b)  Performance Shares.  (i)  Subject to Section 4(c) below, for
each Fiscal Year during the Term, you shall be afforded the opportunity  to
earn  the  Target Amount (as defined below) of shares of Common Stock  (the
"Performance  Shares"), subject to the Company's attaining the  performance
goal  or  goals established in good faith by the Committee and approved  by
the  Board  for  that  Fiscal  Year (hereinafter,  the  "Performance  Share
Arrangement").   The "Target Amount" for each 12-month Fiscal  Year  during
the  Term shall be 200,000 shares of Common Stock.  The "Target Amount" for
each  Fiscal  Year  of the Term of fewer than 12 months  shall  be  200,000
shares of Common Stock multiplied by the Proration Fraction.   In no  event
may you have the opportunity to earn more than 1,000,000 Performance Shares
during the Term.  The performance goal or goals for first Fiscal Year  will
be   established  within  60  days  following  the  Effective  Date.    The
performance goals for subsequent Fiscal Years will be established,  to  the
extent  practicable, prior to the start of the applicable Fiscal Year,  but
in no event later than 90 days following the start of the Fiscal Year.  The
performance  goal or goals established by the Committee for a given  Fiscal
Year  need not be the same goal or goals established by the Committee under
Section 3(b) above.  You may earn fewer than the full number of Performance
Shares  in a given year for performance that is below target for that  year
based  upon an award schedule established by the Committee at the  time  it
sets  the performance targets for the year.  In the event that the  Company
changes  its Fiscal Year during the Term, an equitable adjustment shall  be
made  to  the  Performance Share Arrangement which, in the reasonable  good
faith judgment of the Committee, preserves, to the extent practicable,  the
long-term incentive opportunity set forth above.

           (ii)  The Performance Shares earned by you for the first  Fiscal
Year  will  be  deemed  earned  on the Initial  Vesting  Date  (subject  to
applicable performance targets being achieved) and will be awarded  to  you
as  soon  as practicable following the Initial Vesting Date, provided  that
you have remained in the continuous full-time employ of the Company through
that  date.   The  Performance Shares for the second Fiscal  Year  will  be
awarded  to you on the Initial Vesting Date (provided you are then employed
by  the Company), but will be forfeited in whole or in part as of the  last
day of that Fiscal Year if the performance goal or goals applicable to that
year  are not achieved.  The Performance Shares for each subsequent  Fiscal
Year  will  be  awarded  to you as of the first  day  of  the  Fiscal  Year
(provided  you are then employed by the Company), but will be forfeited  in
whole  or in part as of the last day of that Fiscal Year if the performance
goal or goals applicable to that year are not achieved.  Performance Shares
will  not  be transferrable by you until they have been earned  by  you  in
accordance  with  the provisions of this Section 4(b).  Performance  Shares
awarded  for Fiscal Years during the Term other than the first Fiscal  Year
will  be issued in your name, but the share certificates representing  such
shares will be held by the Company or its agent until they have been earned
in  accordance with the provisions of this Section 4(b) and  will  bear  an
appropriate  legend  or  legends reflecting the transfer  restrictions  and
forfeiture provisions applicable thereto.
                               26
<PAGE>

          (iii)     In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, the
Company   shall  make  equitable  adjustments  to  the  Performance   Share
Arrangement  in an manner intended to preserve the economic  value  of  the
arrangement;  provided, however, that, in the event  of  a  merger  of  the
Company with or into another corporation, such adjustment shall consist  of
a conversion of Performance Shares to be earned under the Performance Share
Arrangement into shares of the surviving corporation in accordance with the
exchange  ratio  approved by the Company's stockholders  and  an  equitable
adjustment  to  the  performance goals applicable to the Performance  Share
Arrangement.

           (c)  Stockholder Approval.  The grant of the Option is expressly
conditioned  upon the stockholders of the Company approving in  a  separate
vote  of  the  stockholders  at  the first annual  or  special  meeting  of
stockholders of the Company to occur after the Effective Date (i) the grant
of  the  Option and (ii) an amendment to the Option Plan to  permit  it  to
comply  with  the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code applicable  to
qualified performance-based compensation.   If such stockholder approval is
not  obtained  in  the  manner contemplated by the previous  sentence,  the
Option  grant shall be void ab initio and of no further force  and  effect.
Similarly, the Performance Share Arrangement is expressly conditioned  upon
the  stockholders  of  the Company approving in  a  separate  vote  of  the
stockholders at the first annual or special meeting of stockholders of  the
Company to occur after the Effective Date the Performance Share Arrangement
and such additional terms as shall be necessary for the arrangement to meet
the  requirements  of  Section 162(m) of the Code applicable  to  qualified
performance-based  compensation.   If  such  stockholder  approval  is  not
obtained  in  the  manner  contemplated  by  the  previous  sentence,   any
outstanding  Performance  Shares shall be  immediately  forfeited  and  the
Performance  Share Arrangement shall be void ab initio and  of  no  further
force and effect.  If the stockholder approval contemplated by this Section
4(c) is not obtained, you and the Company agree to negotiate an alternative
long-term compensation arrangement to be submitted to stockholders  and  to
submit  such alternative long-term compensation arrangement to stockholders
as soon as reasonably practicable, and to repeat this process to the extent
necessary   until   an   alternative  long-term  compensation   arrangement
negotiated  by  you  and  the  Company  is  subsequently  approved  by  the
stockholders.  You and the Company agree to make a good faith and  diligent
effort to obtain the stockholder approval contemplated by this Section 4(c)
as soon as reasonably possible.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding,  the Company shall have no obligation to  call  a  special
meeting   of  stockholders  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  any  approval
contemplated by this Section 4(c).

            (d)   Registration;  Reservation  of  Shares.   To  the  extent
practicable, the Company will undertake to register the Option, the  shares
of Common Stock underlying the Option and the Performance Shares on Form S-
8  under the Securities Act.  The previous sentence, however, shall not  in
any  way be construed as (i) prohibiting the Company from engaging  in  any
transaction  (including  a transaction that will  result  in  a  Change  in
Control), (ii) requiring the Company to file any reports under the Exchange
Act  or  to  maintain  its  registration under the  Exchange  Act  if  such
registration  is not otherwise required or (iii) requiring the registration
of  the  Option, the shares of Common Stock underlying the  Option  or  the
Performance  Shares  on Form S-8 (or any other form) if  Form  S-8  is  not
available  to the Company.  As soon as practicable following the  Effective
Date,  the  Company shall reserve for issuance 1,000,000 shares  of  Common
Stock  for  issuance under the Performance Share Arrangement.  As  soon  as
practicable  following the Effective Date, the Company  shall  reserve  for
issuance  1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance  under  the  Option
Plan in connection with the grant of the Option.

          5.   Effect of Termination of Employment.

           (a)  Right to Resign Following a Year One Change in Control.  In
the  event  of  a Year One Change in Control, you shall have the  right  to
resign  for any reason or for no stated reason during the Election  Window.
In  the  event  of such a resignation, the Company shall pay you  the  full
amount of the accrued but unpaid Salary you have earned through the Date of
Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of your  rate  of
Salary  then  in effect) for all unused vacation time which  you  may  have
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  In addition, the Company shall  pay
you  on the Severance Payment Date an "all in" cash lump sum payment of $10
million.   You will relinquish, as of the Date of Termination, the  Option,
all  rights  under  the Performance Share Arrangement and  any  outstanding
Performance  Shares  and the right to any additional payments  or  benefits
from  the Company under this Agreement.  The provisions of the Section 5(a)
shall  not  apply  if,  at  the time of your resignation,  the  Company  is
entitled to terminate your employment for Cause.

           (b)   Involuntary Termination Prior to the Initial Vesting Date.
In  the  event of your Involuntary Termination prior to the Initial Vesting
Date,  the Company shall pay you the full amount of the accrued but  unpaid
Salary you have earned through the Date of Termination, plus a cash payment
(calculated  on  the basis of your rate of Salary then in effect)  for  all
unused  vacation  time  which  you may have  accrued  as  of  the  Date  of
Termination.   In  addition, the Company shall pay  you  on  the  Severance
Payment  Date an "all in" cash lump sum payment of $10 million.   You  will
relinquish as of the Date of Termination the Option, all rights  under  the
Performance  Share Arrangement and any outstanding Performance  Shares  and
the  right  to  any additional payments or benefits from the Company  under
this Agreement.

           (c)   Involuntary  Termination On or After the  Initial  Vesting
Date.   (i)   In the event of your Involuntary Termination on or after  the
Initial  Vesting  Date, the Company shall pay you the full  amount  of  the
accrued  but  unpaid  Salary  you have earned  through  the  date  of  such
Involuntary  Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the  basis  of
your rate of Salary then in effect) for all unused vacation time which  you
may  have  accrued as of the date of Involuntary Termination.  In addition,
the  Company  shall pay you on the Severance Payment Date a cash  lump  sum
amount  equal to the sum of (i) the Salary payable to you for the remaining
portion  of the Term and (ii) your annual rate of Salary (at the rate  then
in  effect) times the number of whole and partial Contract Years  remaining
in  the  Term. In the event of an Involuntary Termination on or  after  the
Initial Vesting Date, you will retain all Performance Shares that have been
earned  by you on or prior to the date of such Involuntary Termination  and
you  will  continue to have the opportunity to earn the Performance  Shares
for  the  Fiscal Year in which the Involuntary Termination  occurs  if  the
applicable  performance goals for that Fiscal Year are achieved;  provided,
however,  that, if your employment is Involuntarily Terminated  (i)  on  or
after  the  Initial Vesting Date and (ii) on or after a Change  in  Control
(other  than  a Year One Change in Control), then the number of Performance
Shares  you shall earn for the Fiscal Year in which the Date of Termination
occurs shall not be less than the Target Amount for that Fiscal Year (in no
event  greater than 200,000) multiplied by a fraction (in no event  greater
than one), the numerator of which is the number of days in such Fiscal Year
up to and including the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is
365  (the  "Change  in  Control Fraction").   All other  rights  under  the
Performance Share Arrangement and all other outstanding Performance  Shares
will  be  forfeited  as of the Date of Termination.  You  will  retain  the
portion  of  the  Option  that  has vested on  or  prior  to  the  Date  of
Termination.  In addition,  if your employment is Involuntarily  Terminated
(i)  on or after the Initial Vesting Date and (ii) on or after a Change  in
Control  (other than a Year One Change in Control), you shall also vest  in
an  additional portion of the Option on the Date of Termination  determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock in which the Option was
scheduled to vest on the anniversary of the Effective Date occurring on  or
immediately  following  the Date of Termination by the  Change  in  Control
Fraction.  The vested portion of the Option will remain exercisable for  90
days following the Date of Termination.  Any remaining unvested portion  of
the Option will be forfeited as of the Date of Termination.
                                
                               28
<PAGE>

          (ii) In the event of your Involuntary Termination on or after the
Initial Vesting Date, you and your eligible dependents shall continue to be
eligible  to  participate  during  the  Benefit  Continuation  Period   (as
hereinafter  defined)  in the medical, dental, health  and  life  insurance
plans  applicable to you immediately prior to your Involuntary  Termination
on  the  same  terms and conditions in effect for you and  your  dependents
immediately  prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For  purposes  of  the
previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the period beginning
on  the date of Date of Termination and ending on the first anniversary  of
the  Date of Termination; provided, however, that your coverage under  such
plans  and  arrangements shall end on the date that you and your dependents
are  eligible  and elect coverage under the plans of a subsequent  employer
which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you and  your
dependents.   Following  the end of the Benefit  Continuation  Period,  you
shall  be  eligible to elect any applicable "continuation  coverage"  under
Section 4980B(f) of the Code as if the last day of the Benefit Continuation
Period  was  the  date  of your "qualifying event"  for  such  continuation
coverage.

           (iii)     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(c),  as
of the Date of Termination, you will relinquish the right to any additional
payments or benefits from the Company under this Agreement.

           (d)  Termination for Cause; Resignation Without Good Reason.  In
the  event  you  resign without Good Reason or you are  terminated  by  the
Company  for Cause at any time during the Term, the Company shall  pay  you
the  full  amount of the accrued but unpaid Salary you have earned  through
the  Date  of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis  of
your rate of Salary then in effect) for all unused vacation time which  you
may  have  accrued  as  of the Date of Termination.  You  will  immediately
forfeit  as  of  the Date of Termination the then unvested portion  of  the
Option,  all future rights under the Performance Share Arrangement and  any
outstanding Performance Shares that have not been earned as of the Date  of
Termination.  You will retain the portion of the Option that has vested  on
or  prior to the Date of Termination which will remain exercisable  for  90
days following the Date of Termination.  In addition, you shall immediately
relinquish  the  right  to any additional payments  or  benefits  from  the
Company under this Agreement.

           (e)   Death or Disability.  If your employment with the  Company
ends  as  a result of your death or Disability during the Term, the Company
shall  pay you (or, in the event of your death, your Beneficiary) the  full
amount  of  the accrued but unpaid base salary you have earned through  the
Date  of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of  your
rate  of Salary then in effect) for all unused vacation time which you  may
have accrued as of the Date of Termination.   In the event of your death or
Disability,  you  (or  in the event of your death, your  Beneficiary)  will
retain all Performance Shares that have been earned on or prior to the date
of  your  death or Disability and you (or in the event of your death,  your
Beneficiary) will continue to have the opportunity to earn the  Performance
Shares  for the Fiscal Year in which the Involuntary Termination occurs  if
the  applicable performance goals for that Fiscal Year are  achieved.   All
other  rights  under the Performance Share Arrangement  or  and  all  other
outstanding  Performance  Shares  will be  forfeited  as  of  the  Date  of
Termination.  You will retain the portion of the Option that has vested  on
or  prior  to  the  Date  of Termination which will remain  exercisable  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the Option Plan.  In addition,  in  the
event  of  your death, the Option will continue to vest in accordance  with
the provisions of the Option Plan during the six-month period beginning  on
the  date of your death.  Any remaining portion of the Option which has not
vested by the end of the period described in the previous sentence will  be
forfeited.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(e),  as  of  the
Date  of  Termination,  you will relinquish the  right  to  any  additional
payments or benefits from the Company under this Agreement.
                                
                               29
<PAGE>

           (f)   Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination  of  your
employment  by the Company or by you during the Term shall be  communicated
by  a  notice  of  termination to the other party hereto  (the  "Notice  of
Termination").   The  Notice  of Termination shall  indicate  the  specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth  in
reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide  a  basis
for  termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.   The
date   of  your  termination  of  employment  with  the  Company  and   its
subsidiaries  (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined  as  follows:
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a  Notice of Termination is delivered to you by the Company (provided  that
you  shall  not have returned to the full-time performance of  your  duties
during such thirty (30) day period),  (ii) if your employment is terminated
by  the  Company  in  an Involuntary Termination, the date  the  Notice  of
Termination is delivered to you by the Company, (iii) if your employment is
terminated  by  the  Company  for Cause, subject  to  the  applicable  cure
provisions,  the  date such notice is delivered to you by the  Company  and
(iv)  if  you  resign during the Election Window, the date  the  Notice  of
Termination  is  delivered to the Company by you.  If the  basis  for  your
Involuntary  Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, the  Date  of
Termination shall be, subject to the applicable cure provisions,  ten  (10)
days  after the date your Notice of Termination is delivered to the Company
by you.  The Date of Termination for a resignation of employment other than
for Good Reason other than during the Election Window shall be the date the
Notice  of  Termination is delivered to you by the Company.   The  Date  of
Termination in the event of your death shall be the date of your death.  If
your employment ends as a result of the expiration of the Term, the Date of
Termination shall be the last day of the Term.

           (g)   No Mitigation.  You shall not be required to mitigate  the
amount  of  any  payment provided for in this Agreement  by  seeking  other
employment  or  otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment  or  benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you
as the result of employment by another employer.

          (h)  Right of Setoff.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding,  upon your termination or resignation of  employment  with
the  Company  for any reason, the full amount of the outstanding  principal
and interest on the Loan shall become due and payable 90 days following the
applicable  Date of Termination, and the Company and the Lender shall  have
the right to apply any and all amounts payable to you under this Section  5
(or  otherwise payable to you under this Agreement) to the payment  of  the
full  amount  of the then outstanding principal and interest on  the  Loan.
You  hereby  consent  to such action by the Company and hereby  irrevocably
designate the Company as your agent for purposes of the Loan repayment  and
authorize  and  direct  the  Company  to  repay  the  Loan  in  the  manner
contemplated  by  this Section 5(h).  Any remaining amount  of  outstanding
principal and interest that is not paid in the manner contemplated by  this
Section  5(h) shall be due and payable by you within 90 days following  the
applicable Date of Termination.

          6.   Additional Payment.

           (a)   Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the
contrary,  if  it is determined that any Payment would be  subject  to  the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties
with  respect  to  such  excise tax (such excise  tax,  together  with  any
interest  or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise  Tax"),
then  you shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")
in  an  amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic  position
that  you  would  have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had  not  applied  to  the
Payment.   The  amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined  by  the
Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula {(E  x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E}
(or such other formula as the Accounting  Firm deems appropriate which is 
intended to achieve the same result), where
                               30
<PAGE>
     
          E    equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1)
               of the Code;
     
          M    equals  the  sum  of the highest marginal rates1  for  Taxes
               applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

          T    equals  M  plus  the  rate of Excise Tax applicable  to  the
               Payment.

            (b)   Determination  of  Gross-Up  Payment.   Subject  to   the
provisions of Section 5(c), all determinations required under this  Section
6,  including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the  amount  of  the
Payments  constituting excess parachute payments, and  the  amount  of  the
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen
days  of  the  Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination  after  the
Change in Control Date or any other date reasonably requested by you or the
Company  on  which  a determination under this Section 6  is  necessary  or
advisable.   The  Company  shall pay to you the  initial  Gross-Up  Payment
within  5  days  of  the receipt by you and the Company of  the  Accounting
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax
is  payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to  provide
you  with  an  opinion  that the Accounting Firm has substantial  authority
under  the Code and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your federal
income  tax  return.   Any determination by the Accounting  Firm  shall  be
binding  upon  you  and the Company.  If the initial  Gross-Up  Payment  is
insufficient  to  cover  the amount of the Excise Tax  that  is  ultimately
determined  to be owing by you with respect to any Payment (hereinafter  an
"Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies  under  Section
6(c)  below,  shall promptly pay to you an additional Gross-Up  Payment  in
respect of the Underpayment.

           (c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim  by  the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would  require
the  payment  by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice  shall  be
given as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise
the  Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim  is
requested  to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration
of  the  thirty-day  period following the date  on  which  you  notify  the
Company,  or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in
writing  prior  to the expiration of the Notice Period that it  desires  to
contest  the  claim,  you  shall:  (i) give  the  Company  any  information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii)  take  such
action  in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with  respect
to  such  claim  by  an attorney reasonably selected  by  the  Company  and
reasonably  acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with  the  Company  in  good
faith  in  contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate
in  any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings  and  conferences with the taxing authority  in  respect  of  such
claim.   If  requested  by the Company, you agree either  to  pay  the  tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner
and  to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal,  in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more  appellate
courts  as  the Company shall determine; provided, however,  that,  if  the
Company  directs  you  to pay such claim and pursue a refund,  the  Company
shall  advance  the  amount of such payment to  you  on  an  after-tax  and
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the  contest
related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other
                                
                               31
<PAGE>

taxing  authority.  If the Company does not notify you in writing prior  to
the  end  of  the  Notice Period of its desire to contest  the  claim,  the
Company shall pay to you an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect  of  the
excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and you  agree
to pay the amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the claim to the
applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an  Advance,  you
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together  with
any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after  receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall
not  be  entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and  the  Company
does not promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid  by  you
and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up
Payment then owing to you.

           (e)   Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify  you  and
hold  you  harmless,  on  an  after-tax basis, from  any  costs,  expenses,
penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by  you
with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this
Section  6,  including,  without limitation,  any  Losses  related  to  the
Company's  decision  to  contest a claim  or  any  imputed  income  to  you
resulting  from any Advance or action taken on your behalf by  the  Company
hereunder.   The  Company shall pay all legal fees  and  expenses  incurred
under  this  Section 6, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  you in connection with any  actions  taken  by  the
Company  or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The Company shall  also
pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without
limitation,  the fees and expenses related to the opinion  referred  to  in
Section 6(b).

          7.   Successors; Binding Agreement; Attorneys Fees.

           (a)   Assumption  by Successor.  The Company  will  require  any
successor  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,  consolidation
or  otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company expressly to assume and to agree in writing, with a copy to you, to
perform  this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that  the
Company  would  be required to perform it if no such succession  had  taken
place; provided, however, that no such assumption shall relieve the Company
of  its  obligations hereunder.  As used in this Agreement,  the  "Company"
shall  mean  the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor  to  its
business  and/or  assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees  to  perform
this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

           (b)   Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This  Agreement  shall  be
binding   upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  you  (and  your  personal
representatives  and  heirs)  and the Company and  any  organization  which
succeeds  to  substantially all of the business or assets of  the  Company,
whether  by  means  of  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of   all   or
substantially  all  of  the assets of the Company or otherwise,  including,
without  limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by operation  of
law.   This  Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by
your   personal   or  legal  representatives,  executors,   administrators,
successors,   heirs,   distributees,  devisees  and   legatees   or   other
Beneficiary.  If you should die while any amount would still be payable  to
you  hereunder  if  you  had continued to live, all  such  amounts,  unless
otherwise  provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the  terms  of
this Agreement to your Beneficiary.

           (c)  Attorney's Fees.  The Company will pay or reimburse you for
the  reasonable  attorneys  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  you  in  the
negotiation of this Agreement in an amount not to exceed $5,000.

           8.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following

identifies  the  manner  in  which the Board believes  that  you  have  not
substantially  performed  your  duties,  and  which  performance   is   not

requirement;  provided, however, that, anything in this  Agreement  to  the

occurred if:

          (i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,

     election  by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote  of  at
     least a majority of the directors then still in office who either were
     directors  at  the  beginning  of the  period  or  whose  election  or
     nomination  for  election was previously so approved,  cease  for  any
     reason to constitute a majority thereof;
     
          (iii)     there occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
     other  corporate  transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),
     in  each  case, with respect to which the stockholders of the  Company
     immediately  prior to such Transaction do not, immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power  of
     the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
                               33

                                                              March 4, 1996

                     Retention Agreement
                              
                              
Dear Fred:

           Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation  (the "Company"),
considers  it essential to the best interests of its stockholders  to  take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty  and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change  in
control  of  the  Company could result in the departure or  distraction  of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

           The  Board  has  determined, therefore, that  appropriate  steps
should  be  taken  to reinforce and encourage the continued  attention  and
dedication   of  members  of  the  management  of  the  Company   and   its
subsidiaries,   including  yourself,  to  their  assigned  duties   without
distraction  in  the  face of potentially disturbing circumstances  arising
from any possible change in control of the Company.

           In  order to induce you to remain in the employ of the  Company,
the  Company  has  determined  to enter into this  letter  agreement  (this
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in
the  event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words  which
are  not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to  such
words in Section 8 of this Agreement.

           1.    Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of  your
employment  under  this Agreement shall commence on the Change  in  Control
Date  and  shall  continue until the second anniversary of  the  Change  in
Control Date (the "Term").

           2.   Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

          (a)  Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, nature
and  status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no  less
favorable  to  you  than those that you enjoyed immediately  prior  to  the
Change in Control Date.

           (b)   Salary  and  Bonus.   Your base salary  and  annual  bonus
opportunity  may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

            (c)    Incentive  Compensation.   You  shall  be  eligible   to
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established  by
the  Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms  and
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent  with  the
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.
                             48
<PAGE>

           (d)   Benefits.   You  shall be eligible to participate  in  all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides  to its executive employees in accordance with the terms  of  such
plans  and  arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you,  in  the
aggregate,  than  the  terms and provisions available  to  other  executive
employees of the Company.

           (e)  Location.  You will continue to be employed at the business
location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control Date and
the  amount  of time that you are required to travel for business  purposes
will  not  be  increased  in any significant respect  from  the  amount  of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.

          3.   Involuntary Termination During the Term.

           (a)   Severance  Payment.   In the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the
date  of  such  Involuntary Termination the full amount of any  earned  but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at
the  time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated  on
the  basis of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you
may have accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay
you  within  5  days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion  of  the
annual  bonus  for  the year in which your Involuntary Termination  occurs,
calculated  on  the basis of your target bonus for that  year  and  on  the
assumption that all performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In
addition,  the  Company shall pay you in a cash lump  sum,  within  8  days
following the date of your execution of the release described in  the  last
sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of Termination, if later), an
amount  (the  "Severance Payment") equal to the sum of (i) two  times  your
Reference  Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.   The  Severance
Payment  shall  be in lieu of any other severance payments  which  you  are
entitled  to  receive  under any other severance pay  plan  or  arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance
Payment  shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor  of
the  Company  in  substantially the form of the release  required  for  the
receipt of severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the
date  of  this Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the  seven-day
revocation period specified therein.

            (b)   Benefit  Payment.   In  the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination  during  the  Term,  you and  your  eligible  dependents  shall
continue  to  be  eligible to participate during the  Benefit  Continuation
Period  (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health,  life  and
other  fringe benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you  immediately
prior  to your Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions  in
effect  for  you and your dependents immediately prior to such  Involuntary
Termination.   For purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation
Period" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on
the  earlier  to  occur  of  (i) the second  anniversary  of  the  Date  of
Termination and (ii) the date that you and your dependents are eligible and
elect  coverage  under  the plans of a subsequent  employer  which  provide
substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you and your dependents.

           (c)   Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination  of  your
employment  by the Company or by you during the Term shall be  communicated
by  a  notice  of  termination to the other party hereto  (the  "Notice  of
Termination").   The  Notice  of Termination shall  indicate  the  specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth  in
reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide  a  basis
for  termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.   The
date   of  your  termination  of  employment  with  the  Company  and   its
subsidiaries  (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined  as  follows:
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not have returned
to  the  full-time performance of your duties during such thirty  (30)  day
period),  (ii)  if  your employment is terminated  by  the  Company  in  an
Involuntary  Termination,  five (5) days  after  the  date  the  Notice  of
Termination  is received by you and (iii) if your employment is  terminated
by the Company for Cause, the later of the  date specified in the Notice of
                             49
<PAGE>

Termination or ten (10) days following the date such notice is received  by
you.  If the basis  for your Involuntary  Termination  is  your resignation 
for Good Reason, the Date of  Termination shall  be  ten  (10)  days  after 
the date your  Notice  of  Termination  is received  by  the Company.   The 
Date of Termination for a  resignation  of  employment  other than for Good 
Reason shall be  the date set forth  in  the applicable notice, which shall 
be no earlier than ten (10) days after  the date such notice is received by 
the Company.

           (d)   No  Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not  be  required  to
mitigate  the  amount  of any payment provided for  in  this  Agreement  by
seeking  other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment
or  benefit  provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any  compensation
earned by you as the result of employment by another employer or by pension
benefits  paid  by  the  Company or another  employer  after  the  Date  of
Termination or otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii)  of
the last sentence of Section 3(b).

          4.   Additional Payment.

           (a)   Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the
contrary,  if  it is determined that any Payment would be  subject  to  the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties
with  respect  to  such  excise tax (such excise  tax,  together  with  any
interest  or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise  Tax"),
then  you shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")
in  an  amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic  position
that  you  would  have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had  not  applied  to  the
Payment.   The  amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined  by  the
Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula
{(E  x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting  Firm
deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

          E    equals  the  Payments  which are determined  to  be  "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1)
               of the Code;
     
          M    equals the sum of the highest marginal ratesTo be
               expressed in up to three decimal places.  For example, a
               combined federal, state and local marginal rate of 56% would
               be expressed as .560. for Taxes applicable to you at the
               time of the Payment; and

          T    equals  M  plus  the  rate of Excise Tax applicable  to  the
               Payment.

No  Gross-Up  Payments shall be payable hereunder if  the  Accounting  Firm
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

            (b)   Determination  of  Gross-Up  Payment.   Subject  to   the
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this  Section
4,  including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the  amount  of  the
Payments  constituting excess parachute payments, and  the  amount  of  the
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen
days  of the Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any  other
date  reasonably  requested by you or the Company on which a  determination
under  this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay  to
you  the  initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you  and
the Company of the Accounting Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm
determines  that no Excise Tax is payable by you, the Company  shall  cause
the Accounting Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm
has substantial authority under  the Code and  Regulations not to report an 
                             50
<PAGE>

Excise Tax on your federal  income  tax  return.   Any determination by the 
Accounting  Firm  shall  be binding  upon   you  and  the Company.   If the 
initial  Gross-Up  Payment  is  insufficient  to  cover  the  amount of the 
Excise Tax  that  is  ultimately determined to be owing by you with respect 
to  any  Payment  (hereinafter   an  "Underpayment"),  the  Company,  after 
exhausting its remedies  under  Section 4(c)  below,  shall promptly pay to 
you an additional Gross-Up  Payment  in respect of the Underpayment.

           (c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim  by  the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would  require
the  payment  by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice  shall  be
given as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise
the  Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim  is
requested  to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration
of  the  thirty-day  period following the date  on  which  you  notify  the
Company,  or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in
writing  prior  to the expiration of the Notice Period that it  desires  to
contest  the  claim,  you  shall:  (i) give  the  Company  any  information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii)  take  such
action  in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with  respect
to  such  claim  by  an attorney reasonably selected  by  the  Company  and
reasonably  acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with  the  Company  in  good
faith  in  contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate
in  any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings,  and  conferences with the taxing authority in  respect  of  such
claim.   If  requested  by the Company, you agree either  to  pay  the  tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner
and  to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal,  in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more  appellate
courts  as  the Company shall determine; provided, however,  that,  if  the
Company  directs  you  to pay such claim and pursue a refund,  the  Company
shall  advance  the  amount of such payment to  you  on  an  after-tax  and
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the  contest
related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
any  other  issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or  other  taxing
authority.  If the Company does not notify you in writing prior to the  end
of  the Notice Period of its desire to contest the claim, the Company shall
pay  to  you  an  additional  Gross-Up Payment in  respect  of  the  excess
parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and you agree to  pay
the  amount  of  the Excise Tax that is the subject of  the  claim  to  the
applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an  Advance,  you
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together  with
any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after  receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall
not  be  entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and  the  Company
does not promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid  by  you
and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up
Payment then owing to you.

           (e)   Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify  you  and
hold  you  harmless,  on  an  after-tax basis, from  any  costs,  expenses,
penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by  you
with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this
Section  4,  including,  without limitation,  any  Losses  related  to  the
Company's  decision  to  contest a claim  or  any  imputed  income  to  you
resulting  from any Advance or action taken on your behalf by  the  Company
hereunder.   The  Company shall pay all legal fees  and  expenses  incurred
under  this  Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  you in connection with any  actions  taken  by  the
Company  or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The Company shall  also
pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without
limitation,  the fees and expenses related to the opinion  referred  to  in
Section 4(b).
                             51

           (f)   Combined  Payments.   Anything in this Section  4  to  the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a
required  Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount  of
all  Combined  Payments has at the time such payment is  due  exceeded  the
Limit.   If  the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this  Section  4
would  result  in  the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit,  the  Company
shall  pay you only the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which  can
be  paid  to  you  without  causing the aggregate amount  of  all  Combined
Payments to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled to a Gross-
Up  Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or former employees of
the  Company are also entitled to gross-up payments under the corresponding
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangements and the aggregate amount
of  all  such  payments would cause the Limit on Combined  Payments  to  be
exceeded,  the Company shall allocate the amount of the reduction necessary
to comply with the Limit among all such payments in the proportion that the
amount  of each such gross-up payment bears to the aggregate amount of  all
such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) shall require you to repay  to
the  Company any amount that was previously paid to you under this  Section
4.

          5.   Other Provisions.

           (a)   Vesting  and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted  to  you
under  the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become
exercisable  in the event of your Involuntary Termination on  or  following
the Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date
of  the  Equity  Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will  vest  and
become exercisable as of such date.

           (b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the terms
of  the  Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that
the   Administrator  elects  not  to  cash  out  such  Equity  Awards,  the
Administrator has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of  all
or  substantially all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such
Equity  Awards to be assumed or an equivalent option or stock  appreciation
right  granted by the successor corporation to the Company or a  parent  or
subsidiary  of  such successor corporation, or (ii) to  provide  that  your
Equity Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning  on
the  date that you are so notified of such action by the Administrator  and
that such Equity Awards will expire to the extent not exercised at the  end
of such thirty-day period (the "30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator
determines  to  utilize the 30-Day Alternative, the Company shall  pay  you
with  respect to each such Equity Award the excess, if any (the "Additional
Amount"),  of the Change in Control Price you would have received  had  the
Equity  Award  been  cashed out on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control  over the value of the consideration actually received  by  you  in
settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such consideration  is
received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary Termination on
or  after  the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the  date  of  the
Equity  Plan  Change in Control, the Company shall pay you  the  Additional
Amount  as if your employment had continued through the date of the  Equity
Plan  Change  in  Control.  In either case, the payment of  the  Additional
Amount  shall  be  made  within 5 days following the determination  by  the
Administrator of the Change in Control Price.

           (c)   Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the  transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time  or  is
structured  in  such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely  that  you
would  be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing  profits
under  Section  16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability")  if
you  were to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through
a  merger)  of  your  Short-Term Awards as  part  of,  or  prior  to,  such
transaction and (ii) your inability to exercise, tender, sell or  otherwise
dispose  of  your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the date of such  Equity
Plan  Change in Control eliminates or reduces the value of some or  all  of
your  Short-Term  Awards, then, on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control,  the  Company  shall pay you in a cash  lump  sum  the  amount  of
 .   The  provisions of clause (ii) of the previous sentence shall be deemed
to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising,
                             52
<PAGE>

tendering or otherwise disposing of your Short-Term Awards on or  prior  to
the Transaction Date in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b)  a
Short-Term  Award  cannot be repurchased, exchanged or  cashed-out  by  the
Company  (or  other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date  without  a
risk  of  Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are  required  to
delay  the  exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term
Awards  in  order  to  avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  such  delay
results  in your receiving consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued
at  the date such consideration is received) which is of lesser value  than
the  consideration you would have received (valued as of the  date  of  the
Equity Plan Change in Control) for such awards had such delay not occurred.
The  foregoing provisions shall apply to your Equity Awards notwithstanding
your Involuntary Termination of employment with the Company on or after the
Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control.  The
provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if (A) prior to the  Equity
Plan  Change  in Control, the Company provides you at its expense  with  an
opinion  from  a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating  that  the
exercise,  tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term  Awards  as
part  of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan  Change
in  Control  will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  (B)
following your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you  to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or
prior  to  the  Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing  the  value
thereof.

           (d)   General.   Anything  in  this Agreement  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding,   in  no  event  shall  the  vesting  and   exercisability
provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be  less
favorable to you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect  on
the date hereof.

          6.   Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you  on  an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including,  without
limitation,  court  costs  and reasonable legal  fees  and  expenses  which
reflect  common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred  by
you  as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your
termination  of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting,  disputing  or
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or  (iii)
arising  out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability
of  this  Agreement or any provision thereof; provided, however,  that  the
amount  of  the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall  not
exceed $2 million.

          7.   Successors; Binding Agreement.

           (a)   Assumption  by  Successor. The Company  will  require  any
successor  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,  consolidation
or  otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement  in  the
same  manner  and to the same extent that the Company would be required  to
perform  it if no such succession had taken place; provided, however,  that
no  such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.
As  used  in  this  Agreement, the "Company"  shall  mean  the  Company  as
hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business  and/or  assets  as
aforesaid  which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by  operation
of law or otherwise.

           (b)   Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This  Agreement  shall  be
binding   upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  you  (and  your  personal
representatives  and  heirs)  and the Company and  any  organization  which
succeeds  to  substantially all of the business or assets of  the  Company,
whether  by  means  of  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of   all   or
substantially  all  of  the assets of the Company or otherwise,  including,
without  limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by operation  of
law.   This  Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by
your   personal   or  legal  representatives,  executors,   administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you should  die
while  any  amount  would  still be payable to you  hereunder  if  you  had
continued  to  live,  all such amounts, unless otherwise  provided  herein,
shall  be  paid  in  accordance with the terms of this  Agreement  to  your
devisee,  legatee  or other designee or, if there is no such  designee,  to
your estate.
                             53

           8.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

           "Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such  firm  is
unable  or  unwilling  to perform such calculations,  such  other  national
accounting  firm as shall be designated by agreement between  you  and  the
Company.   To  the extent reasonably practicable, one such accounting  firm
shall  be designated to perform the calculations in respect of the Combined
Arrangements.

           "Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in the
applicable  Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity  Plan,
the Board.

           "Cause"  shall mean a termination of your employment during  the
Term  which  is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii)  your  willful
disclosure  of  material  trade  secrets  or  other  material  confidential
information related to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries  or
(iii)  your  willful and continued failure substantially  to  perform  your
duties  with the Company (other than any such failure resulting  from  your
incapacity  due  to  physical  or mental illness  or  any  such  actual  or
anticipated  failure resulting from a resignation by you for  Good  Reason)
after  a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you  by
the  Board,  which demand specifically identifies the manner in  which  the
Board  believes that you have not substantially performed your duties,  and
which  performance is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days  of
receipt of such demand.   For purposes of the previous sentence, no act  or
failure  to  act  on your part shall be deemed "willful"  unless  done,  or
omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable  belief
that  your  action  or omission was in the best interest  of  the  Company.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, you shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  been
terminated  for Cause unless and until there shall have been  delivered  to
you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
than  three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of  the  Board  at  a
meeting  of  the  Board called and held for such purpose (after  reasonable
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be
heard  before  the Board), finding that in the good faith  opinion  of  the
Board  you  were guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i),  (ii)  or
(iii)  of the first sentence of this section and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.

Company  of  a nature that would be required to be reported in response  to
Item  6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange
Act,  whether  or  not  the  Company is  then  subject  to  such  reporting
requirement;  provided, however, that, anything in this  Agreement  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, a Change in Control  shall  be  deemed  to  have
occurred if:

          (i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust,  unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or  any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Exchange Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3  of  the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange  Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing  30%
     or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
     securities  entitled  to  vote in the election  of  directors  of  the
     Company;
     
           (ii)  during  any  period  of  two (2)  consecutive  years  (not
     including  any  period  prior  to the  execution  of  this  Agreement)
     individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the  Board
     and  any new directors, whose election by the Board or nomination  for
     election  by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote  of  at
     least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then still in office who
     either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election
     or  nomination for election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent
     Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof;
                             54
<PAGE>
     
          (iii)     There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
     other  corporate  transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),
     in  each  case, with respect to which the stockholders of the  Company
     immediately  prior to such Transaction do not, immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power  of
     the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
     
           (iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company  are
     sold, liquidated or distributed; or
     
           (v)   there  is a "change in control" of the Company within  the
     meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the Regulations.
     
           "Change in Control Date" shall mean the earliest of (i) the date
on  which the Change in Control occurs, (ii) the date on which the  Company
executes  an  agreement,  the consummation of which  would  result  in  the
occurrence  of  a  Change in Control, (iii) the date the Board  approves  a
transaction  or  series of transactions, the consummation  of  which  would
result  in  a  Change  in Control and (iv) the date the  Company  fails  to
satisfy its obligations to have this agreement assumed by any successor  to
the  Company  in  accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.   If  the
Change  in  Control  Date occurs as a result of an agreement  described  in
clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of  the
Board described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the Change  in
Control  to  which  such agreement or approval relates  (the  "Contemplated
Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then the Term shall expire
on  the  sixtieth  day  (the "Reset Date") following  the  date  the  Board
certifies  by  resolution  duly adopted by three-fourths  (3/4ths)  of  the
Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in  Control
is  not  reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this  sentence
shall  not apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment  with
the Company has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on  or
prior  to  the  Reset  Date  or  (B)  the Contemplated  Change  in  Control
subsequently  occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following  the
Reset  Date, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and  a
new  Term  shall  commence upon the occurrence of a  subsequent  Change  in
Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, if  your
employment with the Company terminates prior to the Change in Control  Date
and  it is reasonably demonstrated that your termination of employment  (i)
was  at  the  request  of  the third party who has taken  steps  reasonably
calculated  to  effect  the Change in Control or (ii)  otherwise  arose  in
connection with or in anticipation of the Change in Control, then Change in
Control  Date  shall mean the date immediately prior to the  date  of  your
termination of employment.

Price"  as  defined  in the applicable Equity Plan and  determined  by  the

Equity Plan to determine such price as of such date.

Agreements  entered into as of the date first set forth above  between  the

Severance Plan.

severance payments made to you under Section 3(a) of this Agreement  or  to
any other employee or former employee under the corresponding provisions of
the  applicable  Combined Arrangement, (ii) severance payments  made  under
Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of the Supplement or the corresponding provisions of
the  applicable Combined Arrangement, (iii) Gross-Up Payments made  to  you
under  Section  6  of  this Agreement or to any other  employee  or  former

and  expenses which are paid or reimbursed to you under Section 6  of  this

payments  made  to you under Section 5 of this Agreement or  to  any  other
employee  or  former  employee under the corresponding  provisions  of  the
applicable  Combined Arrangement and (vi) costs incurred by the Company  in

your  failure  to return to full-time performance of your  duties  for  the
Company within thirty (30) days after written Notice of Termination due  to
Disability  is  given  to you.  Any question as to the  existence  of  your
Disability  upon which you and the Company cannot agree shall be determined
by a qualified independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable
to make such selection, such selection shall be made by any adult member of
your immediate family), and approved by the Company.  The determination  of
such physician made in writing to the Company and to you shall be final and
conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.

     plan  in connection with the Change in Control, or the failure by  the
     Company  to  continue  your  participation  therein  on  at  least  as
     favorable  a  basis, both in terms of the amount of benefits  provided
     and the level of your participation relative to other participants, as
     existed on the Change in Control Date;
     
           (v)   The failure by the Company to continue to provide you with

     5.3  Establishment of Patent Licensing Company

          (a)   In  order  to  maximize the value of the  Company's  patent
     portfolio and to attempt to recover the cost of their advances to  the
     Company, the parties will establish a separate legal entity to  manage
     and  license the patent portfolio now held by the Company (the "Patent
     Venture").
     
          (b)   The  Patent Venture will be established prior to the  First
     Closing  and will initially be owned 100% by the Company.  The Company
     will  inventory all of the Existing Patents by January 26, 1996.   The
     Company will use its best efforts to cause all Existing Patents to  be
     memorialized  to  written invention disclosures by January  29,  1996.
     The  Company  will  assign ownership of the Existing  Patents  to  the
     Patent  Venture  on  or before January 29, 1996, subject  to  Existing
     Patent Licenses.
     
          (c)   The details of the management of the Patent Venture and the
     rights  and  obligations  of each party with respect  ot  such  Patent
     Venture will be as defined in the Patent Venture Agreement.

     of the Patent Venture Agreement, the following provisions shall govern
     the Patent Venture:
     
                (i)  Apple and IBM will establish a management committee of
     equal  representation which will manage the Patent Venture,  determine
     licensing policy, and hire employees.  All significant decisions  will
     be  subject to unanimous consent by Apple and IBM.  Apple and IBM will
     make  an equal initial capital contribution (amount to be determined),
     will split equally the costs of formation, and will contribute equally
     on  a  quarterly  basis operating funds for the Patent  Venture.   The
     Patent  Venture will provide to each of Apple and IBM full  access  to
     all  information concerning its assets and financial  condition.   The
     Company will provide the Patent Venture full access and cooperation in
     ensuring  the  perfection  of  the broadest  possible  rights  in  the
     portfolio.
     
                (ii)  Unless  otherwise  agreed, the  Patent  Venture  will
     terminate,  and the assets distributed to and liabilities  assumed  by
     Apple and IBM (or their designees) as follows:
     
                             84
<PAGE>
          
          
                (A)  On  or  before September 2, 1996, the  Patent  Venture
     will  provide  to  each of Apple and IBM a schedule  of  the  Existing
     Patents.   Such  schedule  will enumerate each  such  Existing  Patent
     separately, provided that rights to "counterparts" shall be considered
     to be part of the related domestic Existing Patent.  In the event that
     two  or  more  U.S. Patents or patent applications have been  combined
     into  a  single patent application outside the U.S., such U.S. Patents
     and/or  patent  applications shall be considered as a single  Existing
     Patent for the purposes of this schedule.
     
                    (B) On September 16, 1996, Apple and IBM will divide up
     the  portfolio  by means of alternate picks: one party will  have  the
     opportunity to select a single Existing Patent to be assigned  to  it;
     followed by the other party selecting another single Existing  Patent;
     and continuing in turn until each Existing Patent in the portfolio has
     been  selected  by one or the other party.  The determination  of  who
     will select the first Existing Patent will be made by a toss of coin.
     
                     (C)   Upon completion of the selection process,  Apple
     and  IBM  shall  cooperate to initiate a bid  process  to  obtain  the
     highest  possible third party bid for the entire patent  portfolio  of
     the  Venture.   This process shall be completed and  the  highest  bid
     obtained on or before January 16, 1997.
     
                     (D)  Within ten (10) days of the completion of the bid
     process  and  no later than January 26, 1997, each of  Apple  and  IBM
     shall  simultaneously  declare to the other  in  writing  whether  the
     highest  bid  is  acceptable to it or not acceptable to  it  with  the
     following results:
     
                         (1)  If both Apple and IBM agree, then the highest
     bid  will  be  accepted and the entire portfolio  transferred  by  the
     Patent Venture to the highest bidder subject to all existing licenses.
     Licenses   granted  to third parties during the  term  of  the  Patent
     Venture  ("Venture Licenses") will be assigned to and future  proceeds
     therefrom will benefit the highest bidder.
     
                          (2)   If  both Apple and IBM disagree,  then  the
     Patent  Venture  will  assign  to each of  Apple  and  IBM  (or  their
     respective  designees)  the  Patents  so  selected,  subject  to   any
     liabilities in the form of licenses set forth in Section  5.3(b)   and
     the Venture Licenses.  Each Venture License will be assigned to one or
     the other of Apple and IBM as appropriate, or to both, but in any case
     the  future  proceeds from each such Venture License will  be  equally
     split between the Apple and IBM.
     
                             85
<PAGE>
          
          
                      (3)    If  one  of  Apple  or  IBM  agrees  and   one
     disagrees, then the portfolio shall be transferred as set forth in (2)
     above,  provided  however that the disagreeing party  shall  have  the
     option  within  ten (10) days from the receipt of the  other  parties'
     declaration  to inform the other party that it will pay to  the  other
     party one-half of the highest bid and in this event the Patent Venture
     will transfer the entire patent portfolio to the disagreeing party  or
     its designee as set forth in (1) above.
     
                     (E)  The other assets of the Patent Venture which  are
     not  Existing  Patent or Venture Licenses will be liquidated  and  the
     proceeds distributed equally net of the payment of remaining debts  or
     obligations.   Notwithstanding the provisions of  Section  (D)  above,
     upon  request of either Apple or IBM, Apple and IBM agree to  continue
     the Patent Venture as a legal entity to manage the separate portfolios
     for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 6 months) necessary for
     an  orderly  assignment  of  Existing Patent  assets  to  third  party
     designees of the parties.
     
     5.4  Obligations Suspended under Research Agreement, etc.

     Unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section  6.1

     including without limitation any funding amounts required to  be  paid
     by  Apple  under the Research Agreement but not required  to  be  paid

extent  permissible  so as to effect the intent of  the  parties,  and  the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not
in  any  way  be affected or impaired thereby.  If necessary to effect  the

language which as closely as possible reflects such intent.

     6.5  Amendments.

     This  Agreement may be modified or waived only by a written  amendment
signed by persons authorized to so bind each party.
                             88
<PAGE>
     
     6.6  Waiver.

     The  waiver  by  any  party  of  any instance  of  any  other  party's
noncompliance  with any obligation or responsibility herein  shall  not  be
deemed  a  waiver  of other instances or of any party's remedies  for  such
noncompliance.

     6.7  Counterparts; Effectiveness.

     This  Agreement  may be executed in one or more counterparts,  all  of
which  shall  be  considered one and the same agreement, and  shall  become
effective  when  one or more counterparts shall have been  signed  by  each
party  and  delivered  to  each other party.  This Agreement  shall  become
effective  upon  execution by Apple and IBM; provided that in  that  event,
Apple and IBM agree to cause Taligent to execute this Agreement as soon  as
practicable after January 3, 1996.

     6.8.      Entire Agreement.

     The  provisions of this Agreement and the other Closing Agreements set

subject  matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, oral or written,
and  all  other communications between the parties relating to the  subject
matter hereof.

     6.9.      Assignment.

          (a)  No party shall assign this Agreement or any of its rights or
     obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of  the  other
     parties,  except  that no such consent shall be required  for  (i)  an
     assignment to a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of a party,
     or  a  parent corporation of which such party is a wholly-owned direct
     or indirect Subsidiary, provided that no such assignment shall relieve
     such  party  of  any obligations hereunder; or (ii) an  assignment  by
     operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of  such
     party.
     
          (b)   Any attempted assignment of this Agreement in violation  of
     this Section shall be void and of no effect.
     
          (c)   This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the  benefit
     of  and  be  enforceable by the parties hereto  and  their  respective
     successors and permitted assigns.
     
     6.10.     No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

     This  Agreement  is  for  the sole benefit of the  parties  and  their
permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or  be
construed  to give to any Person, other than the parties and such  assigns,
any legal or equitable rights hereunder.
                             89
<PAGE>
     
     6.11.     Remedies.

          (a)   In  no event will any party be liable to another party  for
     incidental  or special damages regardless of the form of action,  lost
     profits, lost savings or any other consequential damages, even if such
     party  has  been advised of the possibility of such damages, resulting
     from the breach of its obligations under any Closing Agreement or from
     the  use  of  any confidential or other information or  any  items  or
     products supplied pursuant to the Closing Agreements.
     
          (b)   Because the breach by any party of the provisions  of  this
     Agreement  would  cause irreparable harm and significant  injury  that
     would  be  difficult  to  ascertain and would not  be  compensable  by
     damages  alone, the parties agree that each party will have the  right
     to  enforce  such  provisions by Injunction, specific  performance  or
     other  equitable  relief without prejudice to  any  other  rights  and
     remedies  the  enforcing party may have.  The  reference  to  specific
     Sections in this Section is not a waiver of any party's rights to seek
     equitable relief for breaches of other Sections.
     
     6.12.  Expenses.

          (a)   Whether or not any of the Transactions are consummated, all
     costs  and expenses incurred in connection with the Closing Agreements
     and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or
     expense, except as the parties shall otherwise agree.
     
          (b)  The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in
     full  force and effect regardless of the expiration of this  Agreement
     or the consummation of the Transactions.
     
     6.13      Construction.

     This Agreement has been negotiated by the parties and their respective
counsel  and  will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its  terms  and
without any strict construction in favor of or against any party.
                             90

Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

Exhibit 10.B.14
                    stock purchase agreement


      THIS  STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is dated as of April
4,  1996 (the "Effective Date"), and is made by and between APPLE COMPUTER,
INC.,  a  California corporation (hereinafter "Apple"),  and  SCI  SYSTEMS,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("SCI").


                            Recitals


      A.    Apple  is  engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing,
marketing,  distributing and selling personal computers and  other  related
electronic products.

      B.    Apple  desires to sell, and SCI desires to purchase,  upon  the
terms  and  subject  to the conditions set fort by the  appropriate  person
outstanding shares of capital stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary  of  Apple
("NEWCO"), a corporation which will be formed on or before the Closing Date
to  hold certain assets used by Apple in the operation of its manufacturing
facility in Fountain, Colorado (the "Fountain Facility").

      C.    Apple  and  SCI mutually desire that, after the Closing,  NEWCO
shall operate the Fountain Facility, and shall, inter alia, manufacture and
assemble certain Apple Products at the Fountain Facility, pursuant  to  the
terms and conditions set forth in the Manufacturing Agreement and the other
Related  Agreements to be executed and entered into by the  parties  at  or
prior to the Closing.

      NOW,  THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and of  the
mutual  covenants and agreements herein contained, and for other  good  and
valuable  consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of  which  are  hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties  hereto
agree as follows:

1.   SALE AND TRANSFER OF SHARES; CLOSING

1.1  Shares.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing,  Apple  will  sell, transfer and deliver all  of  the  outstanding
shares  of the capital stock of NEWCO (the "Shares") to SCI, and  SCI  will
purchase the Shares from Apple for the Purchase Price set forth in  Section
1.2.

1.2   Purchase  Price.  The purchase price (the "Purchase Price")  for  the
Shares  will  be  equal to the total capitalization  of  NEWCO  as  of  the
Closing.  Such amount shall be the sum of:  (i) an amount equal to the  net
book  value of the Real Property and the Personal Property (other than  the
Spare  Parts)  as  of  the  Closing Date,  calculated  in  accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (as  shown on NEWCO's books
                               93
<PAGE>



and records); (ii) an amount  equal  to Apple's  original  purchase cost of 
the Spare  Parts  (for purposes  of  this Agreement,  the  parties estimate 
that the portion of  the  total  Purchase Price  allocated to such Spare 
Parts shall be Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000),  but the final 
amount with respect thereto shall be  determined by  the  parties prior to 
the expiration of the Due Diligence Period);  and (iii)  One  Hundred Sixty 
Million Dollars ($160,000,000).  At the  Closing, the  parties shall execute 
an amendment to this Agreement setting forth the final  amount of the total 
Purchase Price.  The entire Purchase Price shall be paid, in cash or other 
immediately available funds, at the Closing.

1.3   Closing.  Consummation of the Transaction (the "Closing") shall  take
place at the offices of the Person mutually agreed upon by SCI and Apple to
act  as  the  escrow agent for the Closing (the "Escrow Agent"),  at  10:00
o'clock  A.M. (local Colorado time) on May 31, 1996, or on such other  date
as  the parties hereto agree.  The date on which the Closing shall occur is
referred  to  herein  as the "Closing Date".  All deliveries  provided  for
herein  from  one  party to the other shall be made to  the  Escrow  Agent,
unless both parties expressly agree otherwise, in writing.

1.4  Closing Obligations.

      A.    At  the  Closing, but prior to delivering  the  Shares  to  SCI
pursuant to Section 1.4.B, Apple will deliver to NEWCO:

Real Property from Apple to NEWCO (the "Deed");

          (iii)     All such other assignments and other instruments as are
reasonably necessary to vest in NEWCO good, valid and marketable  title  to
the Assets; and

           (iv)  All other previously undelivered documents required to  be
delivered  by Apple to NEWCO at or prior to the Closing in connection  with

transfer to SCI;

           (ii)  All other previously undelivered documents required to  be

           (iii)      A  certificate  executed by Apple,  representing  and
warranting  to  SCI that each of Apple's representations and warranties  in
this Agreement was accurate in all respects as of the Effective Date and is
accurate  in all respects as of the Closing Date as if made on the  Closing

warranting  to  Apple that each of SCI's representations and warranties  in
this Agreement was accurate in all respects as of the Effective Date and is

Date  (giving  full  effect to any supplements to  or  amendments  of  this
Agreement  or any of the exhibits attached hereto, in accordance  with  the
provisions of Section 9.4, below).

1.5   Costs and Fees of Escrow.  SCI shall pay the premium for or  cost  of
any  endorsement  desired  by SCI to any Title  Insurance  (as  defined  in
Section  5.9)  which may be issued in connection with the Transaction,  the
cost  of any new or updated survey of the Real Property which SCI may elect
to  obtain  or  request  NEWCO  to obtain,  all  recording  costs  and  all
documentary  stamp taxes in connection with the transfer of the  Assets  to
NEWCO, an amount equal to sixty-three percent (63%) of all state and  local
sales  and  transfer taxes, if any, with respect to the  Personal  Property
arising  from the Transaction, including without limitation any such  taxes
arising  from  the  transfer of the Assets to NEWCO, and  one-half  of  the
Escrow Agent's fee, and all other customary and usual buyer's closing costs
and  escrow  charges applicable to the Transaction.  Apple  shall  pay  the
premium  for  a  standard owner's policy of title insurance  for  the  Real
Property,  one-half of the Escrow Agent's fee, an amount equal  to  thirty-
seven  percent  (37%) of all state and local sales and transfer  taxes,  if

including  without limitation any such taxes arising from the  transfer  of
the  Assets  to  NEWCO, and all other customary and usual seller's  closing
costs  and  escrow charges applicable to the Transaction.  Real estate  and
personal  property taxes and assessments shall be prorated using  the  most
recent  levy and assessments allocable to the Real Property as of the  date
the Deed is recorded.

2.   TRANSFER OF ASSETS; ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

2.1  Assets to be Transferred to NEWCO.;  Subject to and in accordance with
the  terms  and  conditions  hereof, at the  Closing,  Apple  will  assign,
transfer,  convey  and deliver to NEWCO, all of Apple's  right,  title  and
interest in the following:
                               95
<PAGE>



      A.   The real property commonly known as 702 Bandley Drive, Fountain,
Colorado,  as  more  particularly described in Exhibit A  attached  hereto,
together with all improvements on the real property (collectively the "Real
Property"  or  the  "Site"), and all appurtenant rights thereto,  including
without  limitation easements, rights of way, licenses and other  interests
therein; and

      B.    All  personal property (including manufacturing  and  operating
equipment,  and  certain spare parts relating thereto [the "Spare  Parts"])
owned by Apple and used by Apple in its operation of the Fountain Facility,
to  the extent set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto, including machinery,
equipment, computers, tools, vehicles, furniture, all relevant data, files,
books and records at the Fountain Facility regarding the Assets, and office
supplies  and  office  equipment (collectively, the  "Personal  Property").
During  the  Due  Diligence  Period, SCI  and  Apple  shall  identify  with
specificity  those  Spare Parts currently located at the Fountain  Facility
which shall be transferred to NEWCO pursuant to this Agreement, and Exhibit
B  shall be amended, at or prior to the Closing, to accurately reflect such
items; and

      C.   Certain inventories of materials and components currently at the
Site and owned by Apple, and used in connection with Apple's ownership  and
operation of the Assets, which inventory shall be identified by the parties
prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, and shall be set forth
in Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Initial Inventory").

      D.    The  Real Property, the Personal Property (including the  Spare
Parts)  and  the  Initial Inventory are sometimes referred to  collectively
herein as the "Assets".

      E.    As  part of the Transaction, Apple shall assign to  NEWCO,  and
NEWCO  shall  assume,  all authorizations, consents,  approvals,  licenses,
orders,  permits, exemptions of or filings or registrations with any  court
or  governmental or administrative authority which relate solely to Apple's
ownership and operation of the Assets, to the extent such Assigned  Permits
are assignable or transferable, and to the extent not encompassed within or
addressed  by  any of the Related Agreements, all as more particularly  set
forth in Exhibit D attached hereto (collectively, the "Assigned Permits").

      F.    As  part of the Transaction, Apple shall assign to  NEWCO,  and
NEWCO  shall  assume,  certain agreements and  contracts  relating  to  the
operation  of  the Site, including leases to which Apple  is  a  party  and
relating  solely to the Assets, which are set forth in Exhibit  E  attached
hereto, and which SCI shall agree, by written notice to Apple prior to  the
Due  Diligence  Completion  Date, to have NEWCO assume  (collectively,  the
"Assigned Contracts").  To the extent any consents or approvals by,  of  or
from  the  other  parties  to said Assigned Contracts  are  necessary  with
respect  to  such  assignment and assumption, Apple shall use  commercially
reasonable efforts to secure such consents or approvals.  If such  consents

(collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"):  (i) all of Apple's  obligations
arising on and after the Closing under the Assigned Contracts, and (ii) all
of  Apple's obligations arising on and after the Closing under the Assigned

notice  thereof  to  SCI  and SCI shall have the right  to  terminate  this
Agreement  by  written  notice to Apple within five (5)  days  after  SCI's
receipt  or  deemed receipt of such notice, in which event  this  Agreement
shall  immediately  terminate  and the parties  shall  thereafter  have  no
further  rights or obligations hereunder; provided, however,  that  if  SCI
elects  to go forward with the Transaction, all casualty insurance proceeds
relating solely to said casualty or loss with respect to any such damage to
any  of  the  Assets, and/or all the proceeds of any such taking  shall  be

solely responsible for the payment or discharge thereof.

increased by the pro rata amount of any such items which have been  prepaid
by Apple as of the Closing Date.

      B.    338(h)(10) Election.  Apple and SCI will make an election under
Section  338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended  (the
"Code")  (and any corresponding elections under applicable state, local  or

the  purchase  and sale of the Shares under this Agreement.  In  connection
with  any such election, Apple and SCI will jointly execute IRS Form 8023-A

loss incurred by Apple with regard to the making of the 338(h)(10) Election
and will indemnify SCI and NEWCO against any liabilities arising out of any
failure  by  Apple to pay such taxes.  In connection with  such  338(h)(10)
election,  the  Purchase Price shall be allocated by  mutual  agreement  of
Apple  and SCI, as set forth in Exhibit F attached hereto.  Apple  and  SCI
will  file  all tax returns (including amended returns and any  claims  for
refund)   and  information  reports  in  a  manner  consistent  with   such
allocation.

2.8  No Breach By Reason of Sale.;  It is the intention of the parties that
this  Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or attempted  assignment
of  any lease, license, commitment or other contract or agreement to  which
either  SCI  or  Apple  is  a party, if any such  assignment  or  attempted
assignment  would  constitute  a  breach or  violation  thereof;  it  being
understood,  however, that the preceding does not relieve  Apple  from  any
liability to NEWCO or to SCI which Apple would otherwise have hereunder  by
reason  of  a  breach of Apple's representations, warranties, covenants  or
conditions  resulting  from the failure of Apple to  transfer  such  lease,
license, commitment, or other contract or agreement to NEWCO.

2.9   Waiver of Bulk Sales Law Compliance.;  Compliance with the bulk sales
laws  of the State of Colorado, if any, and those of any other jurisdiction
which  may be applicable to the Transaction, is hereby waived by  SCI,  and
Apple  hereby  agrees to defend, indemnify and hold NEWCO and SCI  harmless
from  and  against any claims by any Person arising out of or  due  to  the
failure  to  comply with such bulk sales laws, including without limitation
any claims by any Person against all or any part of the Assets.

2.10  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Filing.;  Promptly  following  execution  of  this
Agreement by the parties, SCI and Apple shall prepare such documentation as
may  be  necessary  to make any required filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust  Improvements  Act  of 1976, as amended  (the  "HSR  Act").   The
parties  shall  cooperate  with respect to the  filing,  including  without
limitation providing relevant data to the other as needed to complete  said
filing.  SCI shall pay all required fees with respect to such filing.

3.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF APPLE.

Apple  hereby  represents  and warrants to SCI and  to  NEWCO,  as  of  the
Effective Date and as of the Closing Date, as follows:

validly  existing  and in good standing under the laws of  California,  has
full  corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it  is  now
being conducted at the Site and to own the Assets, and is duly qualified to

3.2   Authorization.;   The execution and delivery of this  Agreement,  the
Bill of Sale, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the transfer of  the
Shares,  and all deeds, endorsements, assignments and other instruments  to
be  executed and delivered by Apple hereunder, and the consummation of  the
Transaction, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Apple.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered  by
Apple and, when duly and validly executed by SCI, will constitute the valid
and  binding  obligation of Apple, enforceable against Apple in  accordance
with  its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy  and
other similar laws and general principles of equity.  The Deed, the Bill of
Sale, the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the deeds, endorsements,
assignments and other instruments to be executed and delivered to NEWCO  by
Apple at the Closing will be valid and binding obligations of Apple,
                               100
<PAGE>



enforceable  against  Apple  in accordance  with  their  terms,  except  as

principles of equity, and will effectively convey to and vest in NEWCO good
and  marketable  title to the Assets, subject only to  the  conditions  set
forth therein and to the Permitted Liens (as defined in Section 3.5).   The
transfer  of the certificates representing the Shares, and all endorsements
and stock powers executed in connection therewith, and all other documents,
instruments and certificates to be executed and delivered to SCI  by  Apple
at  the Closing will be valid and binding obligations of Apple, enforceable
against Apple in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability  may
be limited by bankruptcy and similar laws and general principles of equity,
and will effectively convey to and vest in SCI good and marketable title to
the Shares.

3.3   No Violation.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by  Apple
and  the performance of this Agreement by Apple will not (i) conflict  with
or  violate the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Apple, (ii)  subject
to the obtaining of all required consents from governmental entities having
jurisdiction  or  other  third  parties, as  provided  in  this  Agreement,
conflict  with  or  violate any law, rule, regulation, order,  judgment  or
decree  applicable  to Apple or by which any of its property  is  bound  or
affected, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a default  (or  an
event  that  with notice or lapse of time or both would become  a  default)
under,  or impair Apple's rights or alter the rights or obligations of  any
third  party under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any  lien  or
encumbrance  on any of the Assets or the Shares pursuant to,  any  material
note,  bond,  mortgage,  indenture, contract,  agreement,  lease,  license,
permit,  franchise or other instrument or obligation to which  Apple  is  a
party  or  by  which Apple is bound or affected, except,  with  respect  to
clauses  (ii)  and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations,  defaults  or
other occurrences that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Apple.

3.4   Consents.   Except for governmental consents required under  the  HSR
Act, which will be requested as provided in Section 2.10 of this Agreement,
and  as  may  be  required under the Assigned Contracts  and  the  Assigned
Permits, no consent of any Person (other than those previously obtained) is
necessary  to  the  consummation  of the  Transaction,  including,  without
limitation,  consents  from parties to loans, contracts,  leases  or  other
agreements and consents from governmental agencies, whether federal, state,
or local or foreign.

3.5  Title to Assets; Encumbrances.

      A.   Apple has good and marketable title to the Personal Property and
the  Initial Inventory, and good, marketable fee simple title to  the  Real
Property,  subject only to the Permitted Liens.  The Assets  are  free  and
clear  of  all liens (including liens for Taxes as defined below),  claims,
charges,  security interests or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
including, without limitation, leases, chattel mortgages, conditional sales
contracts,  collateral security arrangements and other  title  or  interest

all of which shall be deemed "Permitted Liens": (i) minor imperfections  of

Liens  for  current  taxes,  assessments  and  like  impositions  not   yet
delinquent, (iii)  zoning  code  and building code provisions applicable to
                               101

the  Real Property,  (iv) rights reserved to any governmental authority  to
regulate any of the Assets, and (v) inchoate materialmen's, mechanic's and 
workmen's liens or other like liens arising in the ordinary course of business;
none of  which  materially  detract from the value or  impair  the  use  of
the property  subject  thereto  as currently used,  or  materially  impair  
the current operations of the Site.

      B.   With respect to the Real Property, Apple warrants and represents
as follows:

          (i)  No options have been granted to others to purchase, lease or
otherwise  acquire any interest in the Real Property, or any part  thereof.
Apple  has  the exclusive right of possession of each tract comprising  the
Real  Property,  subject  only to matters of record  (including  easements,
rights of way and other similar matters of record).

           (ii)  Neither Apple nor any other Person has caused any work  or
improvements  to be performed upon or made to the Real Property  for  which
there  remains outstanding any payment obligation that would or might serve
as  the  basis for any claim, lien, charge or encumbrance in favor  of  the
Person which performed the work, other than Permitted Liens.

           (iii)      All  requisite certificates of  occupancy  and  other
permits  or approvals required with respect to the improvements on  any  of
the  Real Property and the occupancy and use thereof have been obtained and
are currently in effect.

            (iv)  Except  as  disclosed  to  SCI,  Apple  has  received  no
notification  that  it is in violation of any applicable building,  zoning,
anti-pollution, health or other law, ordinance or regulation in respect  of
the  Assets or in respect of Apple's operations at the Site, and  no  facts
have  come  to  the  attention of Apple to cause it  to  believe  any  such
violation exists.

           (v)   Neither the whole nor any portion of the Real Property  is
subject  to  any  governmental decree or order  to  be  sold  or  is  being
condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any public authority with  or
without payment of compensation therefor, nor to Apple's best knowledge has
any such condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed.

3.6   Condition  of Assets.  The Personal Property has no material  defects
and  is  in  good  operating condition and repair,  normal  wear  and  tear
excepted, and is adequate for the uses to which it is being put;  and  that
portion of the Personal Property identified in Exhibit B as equipment  used
in  the  manufacture  and  assembly of Apple Products  has  been  regularly
maintained in the ordinary course of business.

3.7   Assigned  Permits.   To the best of Apple's knowledge,  the  Assigned
Permits constitute all permits needed to operate the Assets at the Fountain
Facility.
                               102

3.8  Taxes.

      A.   "Taxes" shall mean all taxes, charges, fees, levies, imposts  or
other  assessments, including, without limitation, income, gross  receipts,
excise,  use, transfer, property, sales, license, payroll, withholding  and
franchise  taxes,  imposed by the United States, or  any  state,  local  or
foreign government or subdivision or agency thereof, whether computed on  a
unitary,  combined or any other basis, and also including any interest  and
penalties or additions to tax.

      B.    As of the date hereof, there are no Liens with respect to Taxes
(other  than  Permitted Liens for Taxes not yet delinquent)  in  connection
with the Assets.  Apple has reserved for or paid, withheld, collected,  and
paid  over  to  the  proper governmental authorities all  Taxes  which  are
required  to  be  paid, withheld, collected, or paid to and  including  the
Closing  Date  with respect to the Assets and its operations  at  the  Site
(other  than  Taxes which are being contested by Apple in good faith),  and
Apple  shall  pay  all Taxes due and payable to and including  the  Closing
Date,  to the extent that such amounts are not prorated at the Closing  and
the payment obligation therefor would thereafter rest with NEWCO.

      C.    For  all  periods  to and including the Closing  (whether  such
periods  are  reflected  in a return or report  ending  on  or  before  the
Closing, or after the Closing), NEWCO has timely filed or will have  filed,
all  Federal,  foreign, state, county, local and/or other taxing  authority
tax  returns, reports, or other required filings with respect to any Taxes,
and  has  paid or will pay such Taxes with respect to such returns, reports
or required filings for all such periods as such Taxes become due.

      D.    Apple  agrees that it shall indemnify and hold  SCI  and  NEWCO
harmless  of  and from any loss, liability or expense actually incurred  by
SCI or NEWCO as a result of all tax liability for which NEWCO may be liable
as  a member of an affiliated, consolidated, unitary or combined group  (as
defined  in  Section  1502 of the Code, or any comparable  state  or  local
statute, rule or regulation) which includes Apple or any Apple Affiliates.

3.9   Contracts.  The list of contracts and agreements set forth in Exhibit
E  attached  hereto is a true, complete and correct list of all agreements,
contracts  and commitments necessary to operate the Assets, and to  Apple's
best  knowledge there are no material defaults by any party thereunder  nor
have  any amendments, oral or written, to any such Assigned Contracts  been
made or entered into by Apple except as set forth in said Exhibit E.

3.10 Assumed Liabilities.  Apple has disclosed to SCI all known liabilities
of  Apple  under  and pursuant to the Assigned Contracts and  the  Assigned
Permits, and with respect to the Assets.

3.11  Litigation.  There are no actions, suits, inquiries,  proceedings  or
investigations  by or before any court or governmental or other  regulatory
or   administrative  agency  or  commission  (collectively,  "Proceedings")
pending  or,  to  Apple's best knowledge, threatened against  or  involving
Apple  (other  than solely as plaintiff initiated by Apple in the  ordinary
course  of  collecting receivables) relating to the Assets.   There  is  no
Proceeding known to Apple to be pending or threatened which questions or
                               103
<PAGE>



challenges  the  validity of this Agreement or any action taken  or  to  be
taken  by  Apple  pursuant  to this Agreement or  in  connection  with  the
Transaction; nor to Apple's best knowledge is there any valid basis for any
such Proceeding with respect to Apple.  Apple is not in default under or in
violation  of, nor to Apple's best knowledge is there any valid  basis  for
any  claim of default under or violation of, any of the Assigned Contracts,
which  default or violation would have a Material Adverse Effect on NEWCO's
ownership and operation of the Assets, or on SCI's ownership of NEWCO.

3.12  Compliance with Law.  Except for insubstantial violations which would
have  no Material Adverse Effect, Apple's operations at the Site have  been
conducted  in  accordance with all applicable laws, regulations  and  other
requirements of all national governmental authorities, and of  all  states,
municipalities  and  other  political  subdivisions  and  agencies   having
jurisdiction  over  Apple's  operations at  the  Site,  including,  without
limitation,  all  such  laws,  regulations  and  requirements  relating  to
antitrust,  consumer  protection,  currency  exchange,  equal  opportunity,
health,  occupational  safety,  pension, and  securities.   Apple  has  not
received any notification of any asserted present or past failure by  Apple
to comply with such laws, rules or regulations.

3.13  Environmental Protection.  To Apple's best knowledge, during  Apple's
ownership  and  operation  of  the Fountain Facility,  Apple  has  had  all
permits, licenses and other authorizations which are required in connection
with  its  operations  at  the  Fountain Facility  under  and  pursuant  to
applicable  Federal,  state  and  local laws,  rules,  regulations,  codes,
orders,  decrees,  judgments  or  injunctions  relating  to  pollution   or
protection  of the environment, including without limitation laws  relating
to torts and laws relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened
releases  of  pollutants, contaminants, chemicals or any other  industrial,
hazardous   or   toxic  substances,  materials  or  wastes   (collectively,
"Hazardous Materials") into the environment (including, without limitation,
ambient  air, surface water, ground water, or land), or otherwise  relating
to  the  manufacture,  processing, distribution, use,  treatment,  storage,
disposal,  transport,  handling  of, or exposure  to,  Hazardous  Materials
(collectively, "Environmental Laws") at the Fountain Facility.   Except  as
may  have been disclosed to SCI in any documentation delivered by Apple  to
SCI  prior  to  the  Effective Date, Apple is,  and  has  been  during  its
operations  at  the  Fountain Facility, in compliance with  all  terms  and
conditions of such required permits, licenses and authorizations,  and,  to
the  best of Apple's knowledge, nothing has occurred while Apple has  owned
the  Fountain Facility which would cause Apple to fail to be in  compliance
with said Environmental Laws with respect to its operations at the Fountain
Facility.   Except  as may have been disclosed to SCI in any  documentation
delivered  by Apple to SCI prior to the Effective Date, Apple is not  aware
of,  nor  has Apple received notice of, any past, present or future events,
conditions,  circumstances, activities, practices,  incidents,  actions  or
plans  which may interfere with or prevent continued compliance  with  said
Environmental  Laws,  or which may give rise to any  common  law  or  legal
liability,  or  may otherwise form the basis of any claim, action,  demand,
suit,  proceeding  or hearing, based on or related to Apple's  manufacture,
processing,  distribution,  use, treatment, storage,  disposal,  transport,
handling,  exposure to, emission, discharge, release or threatened  release
into the environment, of any Hazardous Materials at the
                               104
<PAGE>



Fountain  Facility.  There is no civil, criminal or administrative  action,
suit, demand, claim, hearing, notice or demand letter, notice of violation,
investigation,  or  proceeding  pending  or,  to  Apple's  best  knowledge,
threatened,  against Apple relating in any way to said  Environmental  Laws
with respect to Apple's use and operation of the Fountain Facility.

3.14  Occupational  Safety and Health.  Except as set forth  in  Exhibit  I
attached  hereto,  to  Apple's best knowledge, Apple is,  in  all  material
respects,   in   compliance  with  all  standards,  duties,   requirements,
responsibilities,  rules, regulations and orders (hereinafter  "safety  and
health obligations") currently promulgated under, or issued pursuant to  or
in  enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,  or  any
laws, plans, or safety and health obligations currently established by  any
state  or  political  subdivision thereof or by common law,  applicable  to
Apple's  operations  at the Site, with respect to occupational  safety  and
health.  Except as set forth in said Exhibit I, Apple is not aware of,  nor
has  Apple  received  notice  of,  any  past,  present  or  future  events,
conditions,  circumstances, activities, practices,  incidents,  actions  or
plans  relating to its operations at the Site which prevent  compliance  or
continued  compliance with the aforesaid laws, plans or safety  and  health
obligations  as  they  exist on the date hereof  or  any  orders,  decrees,
judgments, or injunctions, which have been issued, entered, promulgated  or
approved  thereunder, or which may give rise to any  common  law  or  legal
liability, or otherwise form the basis of any claim, action, demand,  suit,
proceeding  or hearing, based on Apple's violation of any of the  aforesaid
laws, plans, or safety and health obligations to employees or others and on
its duty to maintain a workplace free of safety and health hazards.  Except
as   set  forth  in  said  Exhibit  I,  there  is  no  civil,  criminal  or
administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, citation, employee  or
other  complaint, notice of violation, investigation, or proceeding pending
or  to Apple's best knowledge threatened against Apple relating in any  way
to  the aforesaid laws, plans, or safety and health obligations established
by the Federal government or any state or political subdivision thereof, or
by  common  law,  or any orders, decrees, judgments or injunctions  issued,
entered,  promulgated  or  approved  thereunder  with  respect  to  Apple's
operations at the Site.

only  relieve  the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder  to  the
extent,  if at all, that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by reason  of
such  delay  or  failure.  The Indemnified Party shall have  the  right  to
employ  separate counsel in any such action and participate in the  defense
thereof,  but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne  by  the
Indemnified  Party  unless  (i)  the employment  thereof  shall  have  been
specifically directed and required by the Indemnifying Party  or  (ii)  the
Indemnifying  Party shall have elected not to assume the  defense  of  such
claim  and  employ counsel.  Without the consent of the Indemnified  Party,
the  Indemnifying Party shall have no right to settle or compromise on  any
non-monetary matter.

8.3   Limitation  of  Liability.   The  obligation  of  either  party  (the
"Indemnifying  Party")  hereunder  to  indemnify  the  other   party   (the
"Indemnified  Party") against any damages or claims  with  respect  to  the
matters  set  forth  in  this Agreement shall be  subject  to  all  of  the
following limitations:

      A.    No  indemnification  shall  be  required  to  be  made  by  the
Indemnifying  Party under this Section 8 or otherwise under this  Agreement
for  any  damages  or  claims in an amount less than One  Thousand  Dollars
($1,000)  for each such claim, unless and until the aggregate of  all  such
claims exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000).

      B.    The  Indemnifying  Party shall be obligated  to  indemnify  the
Indemnified  Party  only  for those damages and  claims  as  to  which  the
Indemnified  Party has given the Indemnifying Party written notice  thereof
on  or  prior  to that date which is five (5) years after the Closing  Date
(whether or not such damages or claims have then actually been sustained or
incurred);  provided,  however,  that  with  respect  to  any  claims   for
indemnification  under Section 3.13, the period shall  be  ten  (10)  years
after  the Closing Date; and, provided, further, that with respect  to  any
claims  for  indemnification under Section 1.5, Section 2.7.B  and  Section
3.8,  the  period shall be five (5) years or such later date on  which  the
statute  of  limitations for any Taxes covered thereby  has  expired.   Any
written notice delivered by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant  to this Section 8.3.B shall set forth the basis of the claim  for
damages  (including, without limitation, reference to the specific warranty
or  representation alleged to have been breached) and, if then determinable
by  the Indemnified Party, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof (or,
if  the Indemnified Party's good faith opinion, no such reasonable estimate
can  then  be  made, the maximum potential damages that in the  Indemnified
Party's  good  faith  opinion might be sustained in  connection  with  such
claim).

      C.    All  damages  shall be computed net of any  actual  income  tax
benefit  resulting  therefrom to the Indemnified  Party  or  any  insurance
coverage with respect thereto which reduces or may reduce the damages  that
would otherwise be sustained.
                               115
<PAGE>



      D.    In no event shall the Indemnifying Party's aggregate obligation
to  indemnify the Indemnified Party for damages exceed an amount  equal  to
twenty percent (20%) of that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the
Real Property and the Personal Property (that is, net of the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the Initial Inventory); provided, however, that
such  limitation  shall  not apply to any claims for  indemnification  with
regard to any party's obligations with respect to Taxes, as in Section 1.5,
Section 2.7.B and Section 3.8 of this Agreement.

      E.    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,  no
director,   officer  or  employee  of any party  shall  have  any  personal
liability  to  any other party as a result of such party's  breach  of  any
warranty or representation hereunder.

9.   CERTAIN OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.

9.1  Further Assurances.

      A.    Upon the request of any of NEWCO, SCI or Apple, any other party
will  execute and deliver to the requesting party, or such party's nominee,
all  such instruments and documents of further assurance or otherwise,  and
will do any and all such acts and things, as may reasonably be required  to
carry  out  the obligations of such party hereunder and to more effectively
consummate the Transaction, including obtaining all consents and  approvals
from  foreign governmental authorities and from third parties under  leases

      B.   After the Closing, NEWCO, SCI and Apple shall from time to time,
at  the request of any other party, and without further cost or expense  to
the  requesting  party,  execute  and deliver  such  other  instruments  of
conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as the requesting party
may  reasonably  require,  in  order to  more  effectively  consummate  the
Transaction,  including  without limitation  any  reasonably  necessary  or
appropriate to vest in NEWCO good and marketable title to the Assets to  be
transferred  hereunder,  and  to effect the  assumption  by  NEWCO  of  the
Assigned Contracts, and any reasonably necessary or appropriate to transfer
or  assign to NEWCO any of the Assigned Permits, or to vest in SCI title to
the Shares.

Apple,  reasonable access during normal business hours  to  the  books  and
records  of  Apple  transferred  to NEWCO  hereunder  (if  any);  provided,
however, that with respect to any such books and records applicable to  the
matters  covered by Section 3.13, SCI agrees that it shall retain or  shall
cause  NEWCO to retain all such books and records for a period of ten  (10)
years  following the Closing Date.  SCI agrees not to destroy nor to permit
NEWCO to destroy any such books or records without prior written notice  to
Apple  and a reasonable opportunity for Apple, at Apple's expense, to  take
custody  thereof.   Any access and inspection rights of Apple  pursuant  to
this  Section 9.2.B shall in no way be in derogation of or supersede or  be
deemed  to  be  in  conflict  with any rights  Apple  may  have  under  the
Manufacturing Agreement or any of the other Related Agreements with respect
to access and inspection.

9.3   Notification of Certain Matters.  Each party shall provide the  other
with prompt notice of (i) any communication alleging that the consent of  a
Person  is or may be required in connection with the Transaction, (ii)  any
communication  from  any  governmental regulatory agency  or  authority  in
connection  with  the  Transaction, and (iii) any Proceeding  commenced  or
threatened  which would have been required to be disclosed by either  party
in connection with such party's warranties and representations as set forth

such exhibits shall be completed as promptly as possible thereafter, and in
no event any later than the Closing.

     B.   If either party discovers, at any time prior to the Closing Date,
any information which would make the warranties and representations of such
party,  as set forth in this Agreement, untrue or incomplete to a  material
extent, or make the exhibits as attached hereto incorrect or misleading  in
any  material manner, or which is needed to accurately reflect  the  rights
and obligations of either party under this Agreement, then such party shall
promptly inform the other party, and the relevant portion of this Agreement
and/or  the relevant exhibit(s) shall be amended or modified as appropriate
to incorporate such new or additional information.

in  connection with the Transaction, including all information generated by
SCI  during  the  performance of its Due Diligence, shall be  held  by  the
receiving party in strict confidence, and neither party shall reveal to any
third party any confidential information of the other party received by  it
in  connection with the Transaction, including without limitation all Apple
Confidential  Information, as that term is defined in  the  Confidentiality
Agreement.  In addition, if the Transaction is not consummated,  then  each

9.6   Rights of NEWCO.  From and after the Closing, every right granted  to
SCI under this Agreement may be exercised by NEWCO, and every obligation of
SCI under this Agreement may be performed or discharged by NEWCO (provided,
however,  that  SCI  shall in no event be relieved  of  any  obligation  or
liability  it may have under this Agreement except by the full  performance
thereof   by   NEWCO,  and  SCI,  by  its  execution  of  this   Agreement,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees such performance by NEWCO),  and
every  covenant,  obligation and liability undertaken by Apple  under  this
Agreement  and every representation and warranty made by Apple  under  this
Agreement  to or for the benefit of SCI shall be deemed to also  have  been
made to and for the benefit of NEWCO.

10.  BROKERS; FINDERS.

Each  of  Apple and SCI represents and warrants to the other that it  dealt
with no broker, finder or similar person, firm, corporation or other entity
entitled to a fee or commission in connection with the Transaction.   Apple
and  SCI  agree,  each with the other, that each will  indemnify  and  hold
harmless  the  other,  in accordance with the provisions  of  Section  8.2,
against  any  claim (including reasonable attorneys' fees)  by  any  Person
claiming  through  the  indemnifying party to  be  entitled  to  a  fee  or
commission in connection with the Transaction.

any  other remedy.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage  would
occur  in  the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were  not

breached.   It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled  to
an  injunction  to  prevent  any breach of this Agreement  and  to  enforce

representations, or warranties, whether  oral or written, among the parties
                               123
<PAGE>



in respect  to  such  subject matter.  If any term or provision of this 
Agreement is found by a court  of competent  jurisdiction  to be void or 
unenforceable,  then  such  term  or provision  shall be deemed stricken 
from this Agreement, and the  remaining terms  and conditions hereof shall 
remain in full force and effect  to  the maximum  extent  possible,  or  such
void or unenforceable  term  shall  be replaced with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve,  to  the extent possible, the purpose of such 
void or unenforceable provision.

Exhibit 10.B.15
               KALEIDA RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
                    BETWEEN APPLE AND IBM

This is a Restructuring Agreement (hereinafter "Agreement") made effective
November 16th, 1995, between Apple Computer, Inc. (hereinafter "Apple"), a
California corporation having its principal place of business in Cupertino,
California, and International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") a New
York corporation having its principal place of business in Armonk, New
York.

1.   GENERAL PLAN

1.1  Apple and IBM are the two principal shareholders in, and have in the
past been the sole providers of funds to, Kaleida Labs, Inc. ("Kaleida"), a
Delaware corporation having its principal place of business in Mountain
View, California.  The parties have decided to make fundamental changes in
Kaleida (hereinafter called the "Restructuring").  Both parties intend to
continue to use Kaleida's ScriptX technology, but to do so in a more
efficient and cost effective manner.  The parties have agreed that they
will cause Kaleida to cease to exist as a separate operating entity,
although Kaleida will continue as a legal entity.  At some later date, the
parties may decide to formally dissolve Kaleida, Kaleida employees,
customers and the public will begin to be informed of the planned changes
on approximately 11/16/95.  Effective approximately 1/16/96, Kaleida will
have no employees and will cease its operations.

1.2  Apple plans to hire a "Core Team" of approximately 10 to 15 Kaleida
employees to continue maintenance and enhancements to ScriptX, which will
be subject to a separate ScriptX Development and License Agreement ("SDLA")
between Apple and IBM.  The parties' obligations and rights relating to
this continuing maintenance and enhancements to ScriptX will be as defined
in that SDLA.

2.   TRANSITION

2.1  It is anticipated that the phasing out of Kaleida's operations will
extend from the current date until some uncertain period of time after
Kaleida ceases its operations (hereinafter called the "Transition Period").
The parties will cause their representatives to oversee the termination of
Kaleida employees, deal with customer claims and support issues, and in
general manage all other aspects of the Restructuring.  The parties will
jointly manage the Restructuring during the Transition Period with a
Transition Team comprised of people with financial, technical, legal, human
resources and other necessary skills from each of the parties.  Mr. David
Nagel of Apple and Mr. Steven Mills of IBM, or their designees, will
resolve any disagreements that the Transition Team cannot resolve.  This
Transition Team will develop and implement action plans to resolve all
issues, will quickly respond to new issues, and will track all issues until
resolved,
                             136
<PAGE>

2.2  All costs of the Restructuring through the Transition Period are
subject to approval by both parties, including such costs as separation
payments to employees, customer and other third party claims, settlement of
Toshiba's share for liquidation/ dissolution value, administrative
expenses, other Kaleida debts, legal and other fees, etc.  Payment of such
costs shall be initially made from Kaleida funds.  If such funds are
insufficient, the parties intend to provide such additional funds as are
approved by the parties, split equally between Apple and IBM.  The parties
do not intend to make the 4th quarter 1995 payment to Kaleida according to
the existing Funding Agreement.  The parties will develop a process to
compensate each other for a pro rata share of any agreed to restructuring
costs that are expended directly by one party.

2.3  In addition, the parties may agree to retain the services of certain
former Kaleida employees on a part time basis after 1/16/96 to assist in
performing administrative and other work during the Transition Period.  The
parties will share equally the costs of retaining the services of such
persons.

3.   TOSHIBA

The parties will mutually determine a fair resolution of the value of
Toshiba's share of Kaleida.  An offer will be made to Toshiba in return for
Toshiba's relinquishing its shares in Kaleida and releasing any claims
against Kaleida, Apple and IBM.

4.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

4.1  The parties agree that the best way to preserve the intellectual
property ("IP") assets of Kaleida is to keep Kaleida as a non-operating
corporation, which will own the IP assets only and have no employees.
Following Toshiba's relinquishment of its shares, Kaleida will be owned 50%
by each party.  The parties will cause Kaleida to be jointly managed by
representatives of the parties and the parties shall advance to Kaleida in
equal amounts, all administrative and operating costs required in excess of
Kaleida's resources.  Necessary corporate documents will be modified to
simplify the administration, requiring a single board member from each
company and other changes.  If and when the parties later formally dissolve
Kaleida, they intend to agree at that time on ownership of IP assets and
any additional licenses that may be needed.

4.2  Under the Multimedia License Agreement entered into among Kaleida,
Apple, and IBM on May 5, 1992 ("MLA") each party has equivalent broad
rights to Kaleida's IP assets on a worldwide, perpetual basis, including
copyrighted ScriptX technology, COS, Malibu, ITV and any other Kaleida
technologies.  In complete satisfaction of the royalty obligations of each
party, the parties will cause Kaleida to accept the cancellation of its pre-
paid royalty obligations to each party and the licenses under the MLA will
become pre-paid and royalty free.  Promptly after completion of the process
described in Section 4.3, the parties will cause Kaleida to deliver to each
party a copy of all existing Company Materials and Development
Environments, which will include the most current electronic and hardcopy
versions of the code (source and object), all documentation, all training
materials, etc., (hereinafter called "Transfer Event").  Each parties use
                             137
<PAGE>

of the Company Materials will be subject to the license grant in Section
6.1 of the MLA, except that SubSections 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.3, and 6.1.1.6 of
that Section are deleted.  Further, the parties agree that all Type I Code
becomes Type II Code as of the date of this Agreement and that the
Development Environments will be licensed according to the terms of Section
6.1, not Section 6.2. The parties also agree that the procedures in Section
4.2 of the MLA need not be followed.  The parties will resolve later any
rights to Kaleida trademarks they may require.

4.3  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the licenses from the Parents to
Kaleida and from Kaleida to the Parents in the MLA will not include any
Parent Materials that have not been incorporated into Company Materials or
used as part of a Development Environment to create or maintain Company
Materials (hereinafter called "Unused Parent Materials").  Prior to the
Transfer Event, the parties will use best efforts to cause all Materials at
Kaleida to be inventoried and to determine which of the Materials are
Unused Parent Materials.  Any copies of Unused Parent Materials found on
Kaleida's premises will, at the contributing Parent's election, either be
returned to the contributing Parent or destroyed.  Once the Transfer Event
has occurred, however, each party will have the complete rights as defined
in Section 4.2 to use the Company Materials in accordance with the license
in the MLA, even if such Company Materials inadvertently contain any Unused
Parent Materials.  The parties will enter into and will cause Kaleida to
enter into an amendment to the MLA to effectuate the provisions of this
Agreement.

4.4  This Agreement does not modify the Malibu Agreement between Apple and
IBM, dated June 27. 1995.

5.   KALEIDA PERSONNEL

The parties will cause Kaleida to provide its employees with 60 days
written notice of termination and separation benefits approved by the
parties.  IBM and Apple may hire certain employees, in addition to the
"Core Team" required for the SDLA.  While the other party's permission or
review will not be required for any hiring decisions, the requirements for
the Core Team will first be identified.  Neither party will interfere with
the attempt by Apple to hire the necessary Kaleida employees into the Core
Team.

6.   OTHER KALEIDA ASSETS

The parties will cause Kaleida to inventory all its non-IP assets.  The
parties will agree on whether assets will be liquidated or distributed
following the settlement with Toshiba.  If assets are liquidated, the
proceeds are to be distributed equally.  The parties will agree on an equal
distribution of all other non-liquidated assets, with appropriate
requirements of the Core Team considered first,

7.   OTHER

The parties will cause any necessary Kaleida corporate documents to be
created or amended in order to effectuate any of the actions described
above, including Board resolutions, amendments
                             138
<PAGE>

to By-Laws, assignments, licenses, etc.  This Agreement shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.  This Agreement shall be governed by New York law.  This Agreement
shall  is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and is not intended
nor shall it be construed as creating any rights in any third party
(including without limitation Kaleida or its other shareholder or
creditors).  This Agreement may be amended or terminated only by written
agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their Authorized Representatives.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1. Interim  information  is  unaudited; however,  in  the  opinion  of  the
   Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement  of
   interim  results have been included.  All adjustments are  of  a  normal
   recurring nature unless specified in a separate note included  in  these
   Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  The results  for  interim
   periods  are  not necessarily indicative of results to be  expected  for
   the  entire year.  These financial statements and notes should  be  read
   in   conjunction  with  the  Company's  annual  consolidated   financial
   statements  and  the notes thereto for the fiscal year  ended  September
   29,  1995, included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   September 29, 1995 (the "1995 Form 10-K").

2. In  the  second  quarter  of 1996, the Company announced  and  began  to
   implement  a  restructuring plan aimed at reducing costs  and  restoring
   profitability to the Company's operations.  The restructuring  plan  was
   necessitated by decreased demand for Company products and the  Company's
   adoption  of  a  new  strategic direction.  The Company's  restructuring
   actions  consist primarily of terminating approximately 2,800  full-time
   employees  (not including employees who will be hired by  the  purchaser
   of  one  of  the Company's domestic manufacturing facilities), canceling
   or  vacating  certain  facility leases as a  result  of  these  employee
   terminations, writing down operating assets to be sold as  a  result  of
   downsizing  operations  and outsourcing various  operational  functions,
   and canceling contracts as a result of terminating e-world(TM), Apple's 
   on-line service.  These actions have resulted in a charge of $207 million,
   including  cash  expenditures of $24 million and non-cash  asset  write-
   downs  of  $2  million, during the second quarter.  The Company  expects
   that  the remaining $181 million accrued balance at March 29, 1996  will
   result in cash expenditures of $123 million over the next 12 months  and
   $12   million  thereafter.   The  Company  expects  that  most  of   the
   contemplated  restructuring actions will be completed  within  the  next
   twelve months and will be financed through current working capital,  the
   sale  of certain long-term assets and investments, possible future short
   and  long  term  borrowings,  and  possible  combined  debt  and  equity
   financing.

   The following table depicts the restructuring activity during the second
   quarter of 1996: (In millions)

4. The  Company's  cash  equivalents consist primarily of  U.S.  Government
   securities,  Euro-dollar deposits, and commercial paper with  maturities
   of   three   months  or  less  at  the  date  of  purchase.   Short-term
   investments  consist principally of Euro-dollar deposits and  commercial
   paper  with  maturities between three and twelve months.  The  Company's
   marketable  equity  securities  consist of  securities  issued  by  U.S.
   corporations  and  are included in "Other assets"  on  the  accompanying
   balance  sheet.  The Company's cash equivalents, short-term investments,
   and  marketable  equity securities are classified and accounted  for  as
   available-for-sale,    and   the   cash   equivalents   and   short-term
   investments are generally held until maturity.   The Company's cash  and
   cash  equivalent balance includes $90 million  pledged as collateral  to
   support short-term borrowings.

   The  adjustments recorded to shareholders' equity for unrealized holding
   gains  (losses)  on available-for-sale cash equivalents  and  short-term
   investments were not material, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   at  March 29, 1996.  The net adjustment recorded to shareholders' equity
   for  unrealized  holding  gains (losses) related  to  marketable  equity
   securities was an unrealized gain of approximately $9 million  at  March
   29, 1996.  The realized gains (losses) recorded to earnings on sales  of
   available-for-sale securities, either individually or in the  aggregate,
   were not material for the three and six months ended March 29, 1996.

5. U.S.  income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of  $407
   million  of  undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's  foreign
   subsidiaries.   It is intended that these earnings will be  indefinitely
   invested  in  operations  outside of  the  United  States.   It  is  not
   practicable  to  determine  the  income  tax  liability  that  might  be
   incurred  if  these earnings were to be distributed.   Except  for  such
   indefinitely  invested earnings, the Company provides  for  federal  and
   state  income  taxes  currently  on undistributed  earnings  of  foreign
   subsidiaries.

   The  Internal  Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal  income  tax
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company  has  made
   certain   prepayments  thereon.   The  Company  contested  the  proposed
   deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues  in
   dispute  for these years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the  IRS
   issued  a notice of deficiency proposing increases to the amount of  the
   Company's  federal  income taxes for the years 1989 through  1991.   The
   Company  has  filed  a  petition with the United  States  Tax  Court  to
   contest  these  alleged  tax  deficiencies.   Management  believes  that
   adequate  provision has been made for any adjustments  that  may  result
   from these tax examinations.

   Deferred  tax assets resulting from the net loss incurred in  the  first
   six  months of 1996 loss are realizable based on the ability  to  offset
   existing deferred tax liabilities.

6. Earnings  per  share is computed using the weighted  average  number  of
   common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares  attributable  to  stock
   options  outstanding  during the period.  Loss  per  share  is  computed
   using  the  weighted average number of common shares outstanding  during
   the period.

7. Certain prior year amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Cash  Flows
   have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

8. No  dividend has been declared for the second quarter of 1996,  and  the
   Board  of  Directors  anticipates that for the  foreseeable  future  the
   Company  will  retain  any  earnings for use in  the  operation  of  its
   business.

9. The  information  set  forth  in Item 1 of  Part  II  hereof  is  hereby
   incorporated by reference.

Overview

The  Company has recently experienced a significant decline in  both  units
shipped  and share of the personal computer market.  For the quarter  ended
March  29,  1996,  the number of the Company's Macintosh computers  shipped
worldwide declined by 14% when compared with  the corresponding quarter  of
1995.   Moreover, according to an industry source, the Company's  share  of
the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.8% and 7.3%,
respectively,  for  the  quarter ended March 29,  1996.   This  decline  in
demand, coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry, has
resulted  in  the Company's decision to develop and recently  announce  key
elements  of  a  new strategic direction intended to improve the  Company's
competitiveness  and  restore its profitability.  The  Company  intends  to
develop  and  market  products and services more  selectively  targeted  to
education,  home  and business segments.  In moving in this  new  strategic
direction,  the  Company  expects  to reduce  the  number  of  new  product
introductions and the number of products in certain categories  within  its
current product portfolio.

and  printers.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased  14%  in  the
second  quarter  when  compared  with the corresponding  quarter  of  1995,
primarily  as  a result of a decline in worldwide demand for  most  product
families,  primarily  entry  level products, due  principally  to  customer
concerns  regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial  condition
and future prospects.  The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer
unit   decreased  1%  in  the  second  quarter  when  compared   with   the
corresponding quarter of 1995, primarily due to pricing actions across  all
product  lines  in  order  to  stimulate demand,  substantially  offset  by
increased  revenues  from a shift in the mix towards  the  Company's  newer
products  and products with multi-media configurations, which  have  higher
average selling prices.

Net sales for the first six months of 1996 decreased when compared with the
first  six months of 1995, resulting from a decrease in peripheral  product
net sales such as displays and printers, partially offset by an increase in
Macintosh computer net sales.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales did  not
change   in  the  first  six  months  of  1996,  when  compared  with   the
corresponding  periods of 1995.  Unit sales increased in the first  quarter
of  1996  when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 due to  unit
sales  increases  within  the  PowerMacintosh(TM) and  Performa (registered 
trademark) families  of desktop personal computers, and were offset by unit
sales  decreases  in  the second  quarter of 1996  when  compared  with the 
corresponding quarter of 1995 as discussed in the preceding paragraph.  The 
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh  computer  unit increased 4% in the 
first six months of 1996,  when compared  with  the corresponding period of 
1995, primarily due to increased  revenues  from a shift in the mix towards 
the Company's newer products  and products with multi-media configurations, 
which  have  higher  average  selling  prices,  partially offset by pricing 
actions across all  product  lines  in order to stimulate demand.

International  net  sales  decreased 11% and increased  4%  in  the  second
quarter and first six months of 1996, respectively, when compared with  the
corresponding  periods  of  1995. The decrease in  the  second  quarter  is
primarily  attributable  to a decrease in net sales  in  Europe  due  to  a
decrease in total Macintosh computer unit sales, partially offset by higher
average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit, and to a decrease in
net  sales in Japan due to a decrease in the average aggregate revenue  per
Macintosh  computer unit.  The increase in the first six  months  primarily
reflects  strong  net  sales growth in Japan and certain  countries  within
Europe  during  the  first  quarter  of  1996.   International  net   sales
represented 59% and 54% of total net sales for the second quarter and first
six  months  of  1996,  respectively, compared with 54%  and  51%  for  the
corresponding   periods  of  1995.   Domestic  net   sales   decreased   by
approximately  26%  and 9% in the second quarter and first  six  months  of
1996, respectively, when compared with the corresponding periods of 1995.

The  Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-needed basis.
Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on
changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ("backlog") can be, and  often
are,  canceled  at  will.   The Company attempts  to  fill  orders  on  the
requested delivery schedules.  The Company's backlog increased slightly  to
approximately $369 million at May 3, 1996, from approximately $365  million
at February 2, 1996.  This increase in backlog relects the effect of delays
in  shipments  to  address quality problems with respect to  certain  entry
level,  Performa and Powerbook products, substantially offset by satisfying
product  backlog in other categories.  The Company estimates  that  product
backlog would have declined to approximately $220 million at May 3, 1996 if
the above-noted delays had not occurred.

In  the  Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at  any
particular  time is not necessarily a meaningful indication of  its  future
business prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation
of  or  immediately following introduction of new products because of over-
ordering  by  dealers  anticipating shortages.  Backlog  often  is  reduced
sharply  once  dealers  and customers believe they  can  obtain  sufficient
supply.   Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of
the  Company's  ability  to  achieve any particular  level  of  revenue  or
financial performance.

The  Company  believes that net sales will remain below prior years  levels
through the first quarter of 1997.

Gross Margin

Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and
its  cost  of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the  sale  of
products is influenced in significant part by the price set by the  Company
for  its products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold
is  based  primarily  on the cost of components and, to  a  lesser  extent,
direct labor costs.   Because the Company uses some components that are not
common  to  the  rest of the personal computer industry (including  certain
ASICs),  its  component costs may be higher than those  incurred  by  other
manufacturers.   The  type and cost of components  included  in  particular
configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and  disk  drives)
are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations
competitive with other manufacturers.  Competition in the personal computer
industry  is intense, and, in the short term, frequent changes  in  pricing
and   product  configuration  are  often  necessary  in  order  to   remain
competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be
significantly  influenced in the short term by actions  undertaken  by  the
Company in response to industrywide competitive pressures.

Gross  margin decreased to (19.3%) and 1.0% during the second  quarter  and
first   six   months  of  1996,  respectively,  when  compared   with   the
corresponding  periods of 1995, primarily as a result  of  a  $616  million
charge  in  the  second quarter of 1996 principally for the  write-down  of
certain  inventory, as well as the cost to cancel excess component  orders,
necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for  many  of  the
Company's products, primarily its entry level products.  Also, the  Company
separately  incurred a $60 million charge that reflects the estimated  cost
to  correct  certain quality problems in certain entry level, Performa  and
Powerbook  products,  covering both goods held  in  inventory  and  shipped
goods.   In  addition, gross margins were adversely affected by  aggressive
pricing  actions  in  Japan, primarily in the first  quarter  of  1996,  in
response  to  extreme competitive actions by other companies attempting  to
gain  market share, and pricing actions in the U.S. and Europe  across  all
product lines in order to stimulate demand.

The  decrease  in gross margin levels in the second quarter and  first  six
months of 1996 compared with the corresponding periods of 1995 was slightly
offset by hedging gains less the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative
to  certain  foreign  currencies.   The Company's  operating  strategy  and
pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the
Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the  short
term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Although  the  Company is taking actions to improve  gross  margins  as  it
implements  its  new strategic plan, it is anticipated that  gross  margins
will  continue to remain under pressure and will remain below prior  years'
levels  through  at least the third quarter of 1996 due  to  a  variety  of
factors,  including  continued  industrywide pricing  pressures,  increased
competition,  compressed product life cycles, and the need to sell  through
current inventory at prices reflecting the recent write-downs.

Research  and development expenditures increased in the second quarter  and
first  six  months of 1996 when compared with the corresponding periods  of
1995, primarily due to higher project and headcount related spending as the
Company  continues  to  invest  in  the development  of  new  products  and
technologies.   The  increase as a percentage of net sales  in  the  second
quarter  when compared with the corresponding quarter of 1995 was primarily
a result of the decrease in the level of net sales.

As  part  of  the Company's restructuring plan and new strategic direction,
the  Company expects to reduce the number of employees engaged in  research
and  development activities and to streamline its product offerings.  As  a
result, the Company expects that research and development expenditures will
decrease relative to historical levels.  Nevertheless, the Company believes
that continued investments in research and development are critical to  its
future  growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly
related to continued, timely development of new and enhanced products.  The
Company  believes a greater portion of its research and development efforts
will  be conducted through collaborations with third parties.  In addition,
where  appropriate  the Company plans to acquire and  license  technologies
from third parties.

Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses  increased  in  the  second
quarter  and  first six months of 1996 when compared with the corresponding
periods  of  1995 primarily due to increased spending related to  marketing
and advertising programs.  The increase as a percentage of net sales in the
second  quarter when compared with the corresponding quarter  of  1995  was
primarily a result of the decrease in the level of net sales.

As  a  result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that  selling,
general   and   administrative  expenditures  will  decrease  relative   to
historical levels, although marketing and advertising expenses are expected
to  remain high relative to historical levels during the remainder of  1996
as the Company attempts to stimulate greater demand for its products.

the  second  quarter of 1996, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item I, and to Factors That May
Affect  Future  Results and Financial Condition as well  as  Liquidity  and

which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

In  the  first  quarter of 1995, the Company lowered its estimates  of  the
total  remaining costs associated with its restructuring plan initiated  in
the  third quarter of 1993 and recorded an adjustment that increased income
by $17 million.

Interest and other income (expense), net, increased to income from  expense
in  the  second quarter and first six months of 1996 when compared  to  the
corresponding periods in 1995, primarily due to favorable variances related
to  realized  and unrealized foreign exchange hedging gains (losses)  as  a
result  of  less volatility in the foreign exchange markets in  the  second
quarter  of  1996  as  compared to the second quarter of  1995,  offset  by
unfavorable  variances in interest income and expense related primarily  to
higher  borrowing  costs, due to the downgradings of the  Company's  credit
ratings by external credit rating agencies, and due to the decrease in cash
and  short-term investment balances during the second quarter and first six
months  of  1996 as compared with the corresponding periods in  1995.   The
Company's  cost  of  funds  has  increased  as  a  result  of  the   recent
downgradings  of  its  short-term debt to NP  and  C  by  Moody's  Investor
Services  and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively, and  of  its
long-term debt to Ba2 and B+ by Moody's Investor Services and Standard  and
Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition

The   Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial  condition  are
dependent  on  the Company's ability to successfully develop,  manufacture,
and  market  technologically innovative products in order to  meet  dynamic
customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors
that  the  Company  must successfully manage in order to achieve  favorable
future  operating  results and financial condition.   Potential  risks  and
uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results  and
financial  condition  include,  without limitation:  continued  competitive
pressures  in the marketplace; the effect any reaction to such  competitive
pressures has on inventory levels and inventory valuations; the effects  of
significant  adverse publicity; the impact of uncertainties concerning  the
Company's  strategic  direction  and financial  condition  on  revenue  and
liquidity;  the effect of continued degradation in the Company's liquidity;
and the effect of restructuring actions.

The  Company  expects  to incur operating losses throughout  at  least  the
remainder of 1996.

Restructuring of Operations

In  the  second  quarter of 1996, the Company formulated  a  new  strategic
direction and announced certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its
cost  structure, improving its competitiveness and restoring profitability.
There are several risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition  to
a  new cost structure.  These include the risk that the Company will not be
able  to  reduce  expenditures quickly enough to restore profitability  and
improve  liquidity and the risk that cost-cutting initiatives  will  impair
the  Company's ability to innovate and remain competitive in  the  computer
industry.

As part of its restructuring effort, the Company intends to implement a new
business model.  Implementation of the new business model involves  several
risks,  including the risk that by simplifying its product line the Company
will  increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce overall
sales  and  increase  its  reliance on unproven  products  and  technology.
Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing the proportion
of  the  Company's products to be produced under outsourcing  arrangements,
the  Company could lose control of the quality of the products manufactured
and lose the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules  in
order  to  respond  to changing market conditions.  In  addition,  the  new
business model could adversely affect employee morale, thereby damaging the
Company's ability to retain and motivate employees.  Also, because the  new
business  model contemplates that the Company will reduce its research  and
development  expenditures  by, among other things,  relying  to  a  greater
extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties,  the
Company  will  have less direct control over its research  and  development
efforts  and its ability to create innovative new products may be  reduced.
Finally, even if the new business model is successfully implemented,  there
can  be  no  assurance that it will effectively resolve the various  issues
currently  facing the Company.  In addition, although the Company  believes
that  the action that it is taking under its restructuring plan should help
restore marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can  be  no
assurance that such actions will succeed.

For  the  foregoing  reasons  there can be no assurance  that  the  current
restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will
not  be required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and
financial  condition  could  be  adversely  affected  should  it  encounter
difficulty  in  effectively managing the transition to  the  new   business
model and cost structure.

For   more  information  regarding  the  Company's  restructuring   actions
initiated  in the second quarter of 1996, refer to Note 2 of the  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial Statements (Unaudited) in Part I, Item  I,  and  to
Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part I, Item II of this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.

Product  Introductions and Transitions

Due  to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which
is   characterized   by  dynamic  customer  demand   patterns   and   rapid
technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and
product  enhancements.   The  success  of  new  product  introductions   is
dependent  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  market  acceptance,  the
Company's  ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,
the  availability of application software for new products,  the  effective
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the
manufacturing  of  products in appropriate quantities to  meet  anticipated
demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in
the   early  stages  of  introduction.   Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot
determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its  sales  or
results of operations.  In addition, the uncertainties and risks associated
with  new  product  introductions may be  increased  as  a  result  of  the
Company's new business model which will, in part, emphasize a refocusing of
product  offerings  and  the introduction of new products  for  key  growth
segments.
                                        
                                       13

The  rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new
product  is  not necessarily an indication of the future rate of  shipments
for  that  product, which depends on many factors, some of  which  are  not
under  the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large
purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to  purchase
new  technology  prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users  ("early
adopters");  purchases  in  satisfaction of pent-up  demand  by  users  who
anticipated  new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases  of  other
products; and over-ordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to  the
aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,
such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many users until new technology  is
accepted  as  "proven"  and for which commonly used software  products  are
available;  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they  believe  they
can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in backlog.

Backlog  is  often  volatile after new product  introductions  due  to  the
aforementioned   demand   factors,  often  increasingly   coincident   with
introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers  believe  they
can obtain sufficient supply of products.

The  measurement  of  demand  for  newly  introduced  products  is  further
complicated by the availability of different product configurations,  which
may   include   various  types  of  built-in  peripherals   and   software.
Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for
various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas  may
be  a  function  of  the  availability of  third-party  software  in  those
localized  versions.   For example, the availability  of  European-language
versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind
the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result  in
lower  initial  demand for the Company's new products  outside  the  United
States,  even  though localized versions of the Company's products  may  be
available.

The  greater integration of functions and complexity of operations  of  the
Company's  products  also increase the risk that latent  defects  or  other
faults  could  be  discovered by customers or end-users  after  volumes  of
products  have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant,
the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product
warranties.
                            
Competition

The  personal  computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized
by  aggressive  pricing  practices, downward  pressure  on  gross  margins,
frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual
improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity
on  the part of consumers and a large number of competitors.  In the  first
six  months  of  1996,  the Company's results of operations  and  financial
condition  were,  and  in  the near future are expected  to  be,  adversely
affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on  gross
margins.   The  industry has also been characterized by rapid technological
advances  in  software functionality and hardware performance and  features
based  on  existing or emerging industry standards.  Some of the  Company's
competitors   have   greater   financial,  marketing,   manufacturing   and
technological  resources,  broader  product  lines  and  larger   installed
customer bases than those of the Company.

The  Company's  future  operating results and financial  condition  may  be
affected  by  overall  demand for personal computers and  general  customer
preferences  for  one platform over another or one set of product  features
over another.

On  November  7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with  International
Business  Machines Corporation ("IBM") and Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware
reference  platform  for the PowerPC microprocessor  that  is  intended  to
deliver a much wider range of operating system and application choices  for
computer  customers.  As a result of this agreement, the Company is  moving
forward  with its efforts to make the Macintosh operating system  available
on  the  common platform.  In line with its efforts, on November 13,  1995,
the  Company,  IBM,  and Motorola, Inc. announced the availability  of  the
"PowerPC  Platform"  specifications,  which  define  a  "unified"  personal
computer architecture and combine the Power Macintosh platform and  the  PC
environment.   Accordingly,  the Company's  future  operating  results  and
financial condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement
this  agreement  and to manage the risk associated with the  transition  to
this new hardware reference platform.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                       14

The  Company  is  currently the primary maker of  hardware  that  uses  the
Macintosh  operating system ("Mac OS").  The Mac OS has a  minority  market
share  in  the  personal computer market, which is dominated by  makers  of
computers that run the MS-DOS(registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows(TM) 
operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived
advantages over MS-DOS  and  Windows, has been a driving force behind sales 
of  the  Company's personal  computer hardware  for the past several years.  
Recent innovations in  the  Windows platform, including those introduced by 
Windows  95,  have added features  to the Windows platform similar to those 
offered by the  Mac OS.   The Company is currently taking and will continue
to take steps  to respond  to the competitive pressures being placed on its 
personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows
platform.   The company's future operating  results and financial condition 
may be  affected by  its  ability to  increase  the installed  base for the 
Macintosh platform. As  part of its efforts to increase the  installed base
for the  Macintosh platform,  the  Company announced the  licensing of  the  
Mac  OS  to  other personal  computer vendors in  January 1995, and several 
vendors currently sell products that utilize the Macintosh operating system.   
The Company believes  that  licensing the operating system will  result  in
a broader installed  base on which software vendors can develop and provide
technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  However, there can be no 
assurance that the installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the 
operating system  or  that  licensing  will  result in an increase  in  the  
number  of application  software  titles or the rate at which vendors  will
bring  to market application software based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as 
a result of licensing its operating system, the Company is forced to compete
with other  companies producing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits
to the  Company  from licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than
offset by the disadvantages of being required to compete with them.
                                        
As  a  supplemental  means of addressing the competition  from  MS-DOS  and
Windows,  the  Company has devoted substantial resources toward  developing
personal computer products capable of running application software designed
for  the  MS-DOS or Windows operating systems ("Cross-Platform  Products").
These  products include both the RISC-based PowerPC 601 microprocessor  and
the  486  DX2/66  microprocessor, which enable users  to  run  concurrently
applications  that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1  or  Windows  95
operating  systems.  The Company has announced that it intends to  ship  by
June  1996  Cross-Platform Products that include the Pentium  or  586-class
chip,  or  in which a Pentium or 586-class microprocessor can be  installed
through the use of an add-on card.

The  Company plans to supply customers who purchase Cross-Platform Products
with  operating system software under licensing agreements with  Microsoft.
The  Company's prior licensing agreement with Microsoft expired on December
31,  1995.  The Company recently entered into new licensing agreements with
Microsoft that will permit the Company to distribute MS-DOS and permit  the
Company  to  acquire  the  rights to distribute certain  Windows  operating
systems,  including Windows 95.  In order to distribute  Windows  operating
systems,  the  Company will need to enter into one or more agreements  with
certain Microsoft distributors.

Decisions  by  customers to purchase the Company's personal  computers,  as
opposed  to  MS-DOS  or  Windows-based systems,  are  often  based  on  the
availability  of  third-party  software for particular  applications.   The
Company  believes that the availability of third-party application software
for  the  Company's  hardware products depends in part on  the  third-party
developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing,
maintaining  and upgrading such software for the Company's products  versus
software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is  based
on  factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products,
the  anticipated  potential revenue that may be earned, and  the  costs  of
developing  such  software products.  To the extent  the  Company's  recent
financial  losses have caused software developers to question the Company's
position  in  the personal computer market, they could be less inclined  to
develop  new  application  software or upgrade existing  software  for  the
Company's  products  and  more inclined to devote  their  resources  toward
developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.
Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of application software for
the  Company's  products.  Accordingly, Microsoft's interest  in  producing
application  software  for  the Company's products  may  be  influenced  by
Microsoft's  perception  of  its interests as the  vendor  of  the  Windows
operating systems.

The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products  is  also
dependent  on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers  of  the
PowerPC  RISC  microprocessor for certain of  the  Company's  products,  to
continue  to  supply to the Company microprocessors that  produce  superior
price/performance  results compared with those supplied  to  the  Company's
competitors  by  Intel  Corporation, the  developer  and  producer  of  the
microprocessors  used  by  most personal computers  using  the  MS-DOS  and
Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  Intel
microprocessors   as   well   as  workstations   based   on   the   PowerPC
microprocessor,  and  is also the developer of OS/2, a competing  operating
system  to  the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying
the  Company  with   microprocessors for  the  Company's  products  may  be
influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer
of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.

Recently,  several competitors of the Company, including  Compaq,  IBM  and
Microsoft,  have  either targeted or announced their  intention  to  target
certain  of  the  Company's key market segments,  including  education  and
publishing.   Some  of  these companies have greater financial,  marketing,
manufacturing and technological resources than the Company.

The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be
affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize  on
its investments in other markets, such as the markets for Internet services
and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.


Global Market Risks

A  large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international
operations.   As  a result, the Company's operations and financial  results
could  be significantly affected by international factors, such as  changes
in  foreign  currency  exchange rates or weak economic  conditions  in  the
foreign  markets in which the Company distributes its products.   When  the
U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value  of
non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens,  the
U.S.    dollar   value   of   non-U.S.   dollar-based   sales    increases.
Correspondingly,  the  U.S.  dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based  costs
increases  when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S.  dollar
strengthens.   Overall, the Company is a net receiver of  currencies  other
than  the  U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar  and  is
adversely  affected  by  a  stronger dollar relative  to  major  currencies
worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and  in  particular  a
strengthening  of  the  U.S. dollar, may negatively  affect  the  Company's
consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars).

To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on
the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and
operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-based
exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward
and option contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.  Currently,
hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year.  The
Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain
other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable,
but not firmly committed transactions currently do not extend beyond one
year.  To reduce the costs associated with these ongoing foreign exchange
hedging programs, the Company also regularly sells foreign exchange option
contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions.  All
foreign
exchange forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges,
including all transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the
Company's foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and
are adjusted on each balance sheet date for
changes in exchange rates.

While  the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the  interest
rates  of  many  of  the  world's  leading  industrialized  countries,  the
Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations  in
the  general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S.
interest  rates  affect  the interest earned on the  Company's  cash,  cash
equivalents,  and short-term investments as well as interest  paid  on  its
short-term  borrowings  and  long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of
fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into  interest
rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps are intended  to
better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash,  cash
equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  with  the  fixed-rate  interest
expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest  rate
swap  and  option  transactions in order to  diversify  a  portion  of  the
Company's  exposure  away  from fluctuations in  short-term  U.S.  interest
rates.   These instruments may extend the Company's cash investment horizon
up to a maximum effective duration of three years.
                                        
To  ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange
and  interest  rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor  the  risks  and
opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually  monitors
its  foreign  exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate
swap  and  option positions on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction  with
its  underlying  foreign  currency-  and interest  rate-related  exposures,
respectively,  from  both  an  accounting  and  an  economic   perspective.
However,  given  the  effective horizons of the Company's  risk  management
activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will
offset  more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting  from
unfavorable  movements in either foreign exchange or  interest  rates.   In
addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and  losses
related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide
with  the  timing  of  gains and losses related to the underlying  economic
exposures,  and  as  such,  may adversely affect  the  Company's  operating
results  and financial position.  The Company generally does not engage  in
leveraged hedging.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                       16
<PAGE>


The  Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the  costs
of  its  hedging  transactions, as well as the willingness of  its  trading
partners to enter into hedging transactions with the Company.

Inventory and Supply

In  line  with  the Company's efforts to redesign its business  model,  the
Company intends to streamline its product offerings in its key usage  areas
in  education, business and the home.  This simplification of product lines
has  resulted in inventory reserves.   Cancellation fees related to  custom
component  inventory purchased for anticipated product  introductions  that
have  been canceled have also been paid or incurred.  The Company has  also
separately  provided  for  the estimated cost to  correct  certain  quality
problems on certain entry level, Performa and Powerbook products.  Although
the  Company  believes its inventory and related reserves are adequate,  no
assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory
charges.

The Company must order components for its products and build inventory well
in  advance  of  product  shipments.  Because  the  Company's  markets  are
volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk
that   the  Company  will  forecast  incorrectly  and  produce  excess   or
insufficient  inventories of particular products.  The Company's  operating
results  and  financial  condition have been  and  may  in  the  future  be
materially  adversely  affected  by the Company's  ability  to  manage  its
inventory  levels  and  respond to short-term  shifts  in  customer  demand
patterns.
                                        
Certain  of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part  by
third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of  the
Company  or  otherwise.  As a result of the Company's  restructuring  plan,
which  includes the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado  manufacturing
facility  to  SCI  Systems,  Inc.   ("SCI")  and  a  related  manufacturing
outsourcing  agreement  with SCI, the proportion of its  products  produced
under   outsourcing   arrangements  will   increase.    While   outsourcing
arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they may  also  reduce
the  direct  control  the  Company currently has over  production.   It  is
uncertain what effect such lessened control will have on the quality of the
products  manufactured  or the flexibility of the  Company  to  respond  to
changing  market  conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by  the  Company  to
manage  its  inventory  under outsourcing arrangements  could  subject  the
Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement.

Moreover,  although  arrangements  with  such  manufacturers  may   contain
provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least
initially  responsible  to  the  ultimate consumer  for  warranty  service.
Accordingly,  in  the event of product defects or warranty  liability,  the
Company  may remain primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect  or
warranty   liability,  whether  pursuant  to  arrangements  with   contract
manufacturers  or  otherwise, could adversely affect the  Company's  future
operating results and financial condition.
                                        
The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited  by
the  availability  of  key  components.   The  Company  believes  that  the
availability   from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer   industry   of
microprocessors  and  ASICs  presents the most  significant  potential  for
constraining   the   Company's  ability  to  produce  products.    Specific
microprocessors  manufactured  by Motorola,  Inc.  and  IBM  are  currently
available only from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors are
currently  in  the  early stages of ramp-up for production  and  thus  have
limited  availability.   The Company and other producers  in  the  personal
computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with  other
industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to
either  increased  consumer demand or increased use  of  semiconductors  in
their  products  (such  as  the cellular phone and automotive  industries).
Finally,  the Company uses some components that are not common to the  rest
of  the  personal  computer industry (including certain ASICs).   Continued
availability  of  these components may be affected  if  producers  were  to
decide  to  concentrate on the production of common components  instead  of
components  customized  to meet the Company's requirements.   Such  product
supply  constraints  and corresponding increased costs could  decrease  the
Company's  market share and adversely affect the Company's future operating
results and financial condition.

Marketing and Distribution

A  number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the
Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of distribution
is  through  third-party computer resellers.  The Company also  distributes
product through consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer
electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business  and
financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of
these resellers weakens or if resellers within consumer channels decide not
to continue to distribute the Company's products.

Uncertainty over the demand for the Company's products may cause  resellers
to  reduce the ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under the
Company's  arrangements with its resellers, resellers have  the  option  to
reduce  or  eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most  instances
without  financial  penalty.  Resellers also  have  the  option  to  return
products to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which
they  may  be  assessed fees.  In the second quarter of 1996,  the  Company
experienced a reduction in ordering from historical levels by resellers due
to uncertainty concerning the Company's condition.

Other Factors

The  majority  of  the Company's research and development  activities,  its
corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations are  located
near  major  seismic faults. The Company's operating results and  financial
condition  could be materially adversely affected in the event of  a  major
earthquake.

Production  and marketing of products in certain states and  countries  may
subject  the Company to environmental and other regulations which  include,
in  some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with
the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life,
and  leave  responsibility for environmentally safe disposal  or  recycling
with  the  Company.  It is unclear what the effect of such regulation  will
have on the Company's future operating results and financial condition.
                                        
The  Company  is  currently  in  the  process  of  replacing  its  existing
transaction  systems  (which  include order management,  distribution,  and
finance)  with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort  to
increase  operational efficiency.  The Company's future  operating  results
and  financial  condition could be adversely affected  if  the  Company  is
unable  to  implement  and effectively manage the transition  to  this  new
integrated system.

Because  of  the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the
Company's   operating  results  and  financial  condition,  past  financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator  of  future
performance,  and investors should not use historical trends to  anticipate
results   or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the   Company's
participation  in  a highly dynamic industry often results  in  significant
volatility of the Company's common stock price.
                                        
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  Company's  financial position with respect to cash, cash  equivalents,
and short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings, decreased to $240
million  at March 29, 1996, from $491 million at September 29,  1995.   The
Company's  financial position with respect to cash, cash  equivalents,  and
short-term  investments decreased to $592 million at March 29,  1996,  from
$952 million at September 29, 1995.  The Company's cash and cash equivalent
balance  at  March  29,  1996 and September 29, 1995 includes  $90  million
pledged as collateral  to support short-term borrowings.

Cash  used for operations during the first six months of 1996 totaled  $177
million, primarily due to the net loss.  Also contributing to cash used for
operations  were  lower  accounts payable  levels,  due  to  a  substantial
reduction  in inventory purchases.  Cash used for operations was  partially
offset by a decrease in accounts receivable.
                                        
Net  cash  used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment  totaled
$40  million  in the first six months of 1996, and consisted  primarily  of
increases  in  manufacturing machinery and equipment  and  buildings.   The
Company expects that capital expenditures in 1996 will decline relative  to
1995 expenditure levels.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                       18

Short-term  borrowings at March 29, 1996, were approximately  $109  million
lower  than  at September 29, 1995.  The issuance of commercial  paper  has
been  discontinued and short-term borrowings have largely ceased. On  March
29, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, entered into loan
agreements  in  the  aggregate amount of $146 million with  certain  banks,
which   extended  or  replaced  approximately  $146  million  of   existing
borrowings.  Also on this date, Apple Japan, Inc. repaid approximately  $54
million  of  existing  borrowings.  The current loans have  maturity  dates
ranging  from June 28, 1996 to September 30, 1996.  Two of these loans  are
guaranteed  by  the  Company.  On April 2, 1996,  Apple  Computer  B.V.,  a
subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement to extend its existing
$200 million secured credit facility.  The amount currently outstanding  is
approximately $190 million.  The facility matures on June 28, 1996  and  is
guaranteed  by the Company.  In connection with this facility, the  Company
has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance.

The Company's balance of long-term debt remained relatively constant during
the first six months of 1996.  Substantially the entire amount of long-term
borrowings  represents  $300 million aggregate  principal  amount  of  6.5%
unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration statement  filed
with   the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  1994.   This   shelf
registration was for the registration of debt and other securities  for  an
aggregate offering amount of $500 million.  The notes were sold at  99.925%
of  par,  for  an  effective yield to maturity of  6.51%.   The  notes  pay
interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.

The  Internal  Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies
for  the  years  1984  through  1991, and  the  Company  has  made  certain
prepayments  thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies  for
the  years  1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for  these
years  have  been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a  notice  of
deficiency  proposing  increases to the amount  of  the  Company's  federal
income  taxes  for the years 1989 through 1991.  The Company  has  filed  a
petition  with  the  United States Tax Court to contest these  alleged  tax
deficiencies.   Management believes that adequate provision has  been  made
for any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.

It  will be necessary for the Company to borrow in the near term to finance
its working capital needs, because the Company does not expect that it will
generate  cash  from  operations  in this  time  frame.   In  addition,  in
connection with the restructuring actions, referred to on page 6 in Note  2
of  the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company had $24
million  of cash expenditures in the second quarter of 1996 and expects  to
incur  $123  million of cash expenditures over the next 12  months.   These
cash  expenditures  are  expected to be financed  through  current  working
capital, the sale of certain assets and other investments, possible  future
short  and  long-term  borrowings, and possible combined  debt  and  equity
financing.

As  noted  on  page  12  under the subheading "Interest  and  other  income
(expense), net",  the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result  of
the  recent  downgradings of its short-term debt to NP  and  C  by  Moody's
Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively,  and
of  its  long-term  debt  to Ba2 and B+ by Moody's  Investor  Services  and
Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In addition, the  Company
may be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain  of
its  borrowings and to agree to more stringent covenants than in the  past.
The  Company is seeking alternative sources of liquidity and is  discussing
various  alternatives  with several financial institutions.   Although  the
Company  believes it will be able to arrange short- and long-term financing
that  will  cover  its needs, it currently does not have  commitments  from
lenders to provide such funding.  The Company believes that its balances of
cash,  cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with possible
short-  and  long-term  borrowings and possible combined  debt  and  equity
financing  that  the Company believes it will be able to  obtain,  will  be
sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, including the impact of
planned  restructuring  actions,  on a  short-  and  long-term  basis.   No
assurance  can be given that the necessary financing will be  obtained,  or
that  any  additional financing that may be required if  the  restructuring
plan takes longer to implement than anticipated or is not successful can be
obtained.   If  the  Company is unable to obtain  adequate  financing,  its
liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be materially
adversely affected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Management  is  not  aware of any pending legal proceedings  to  which  the
Company is a party that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations as reported in  the
accompanying financial statements.

Reference is made to Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Report on
Form  10-Q  for the fiscal quarter ended December 29, 1995 for a discussion
of  certain purported shareholder class action suits filed in January 1996.
In  February  1996, the complaint in the action styled Abraham  and  Evelyn
Kostick  Trust v. Peter Crisp, et al. was amended to add additional parties
and to add purported class and derivative claims based on theories such  as
breach of fiduciary duty, misrepresentation and insider trading.  In  March
1996,  a  purported  shareholder class action  styled  Derek  Pritchard  v.
Michael  Spindler, et al., was filed in the California Superior  Court  for
Santa  Clara County, alleging that the defendants breached their  fiduciary
duty by allegedly rejecting an offer from a computer company (not named  in
the  complaint)  to  acquire the Company at a price in excess  of  $50  per
share.

The  Company has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits (fewer than
100) in each of which the complaint alleges that the plaintiff incurred so-
called "repetitive stress injuries" to the upper extremities as a result of
using  keyboards  and/or mouse input devices sold by the Company.   All  of
these cases are in various stages of pre-trial activity.

The Company believes that all of the actions cited above are without merit.

                      Employment Agreement
                                
                                
Dear Dr. Amelio:

           The  following sets forth our agreement regarding the terms  and
provisions of your employment as an officer and employee of Apple Computer,
Inc.  (the  "Company") during the Term.  Capitalized words  which  are  not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words  in
Section 8 of this Agreement.

           1.    Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of  your
employment under this Agreement (the "Term") shall commence on February  2,
1996  (the "Effective Date") and shall continue until the fifth anniversary
of  the  Effective Date.  For purposes of this Agreement,  "Contract  Year"
means each 12-month period during the term beginning on the Effective  Date
or  anniversary thereof, and "Fiscal Year" means the Company's fiscal year.
Subject  to  the provisions of Section 5 below, either party may  terminate
the Term at any time.

           2.   Employment During the Term.  During the Term, you shall  be
employed  as  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the  Company  and
shall  report  directly  to  the Board of Directors  of  the  Company  (the
"Board"),  and  your duties and responsibilities to the  Company  shall  be
consistent  in  all  respects with such positions.  During  the  Term,  the
Company  will  take  all  steps reasonably necessary  to  assure  that  you
continue  to  be  elected  or appointed to the  Board.   You  shall  devote
substantially  all  of your business time, attention,  skills  and  efforts
exclusively  to  the  business and affairs of the Company,  other  than  de
minimis  amounts of time devoted by you to the management of your  personal
finances  or to engaging in charitable or community services.   During  the
Term,  you shall be permitted to continue serving as a member of the boards
of  directors of the corporations on which you are serving as a director on
the  Effective  Date  (and on such other boards  of  directors  as  may  be
approved in writing from time to time by the Board) as long as such service
does not adversely affect the performance of your duties to the Company  as
contemplated  hereunder.  Your principal place of employment shall  be  the
executive offices of the Company as established from time to time, although
you  understand and agree that you will be required to travel from time  to
time for business purposes.

          3.   Compensation During the Term.

           (a)   Base  Salary.   As compensation to you  for  all  services
rendered  to the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company will pay  you  a
base  salary (the "Salary") at the rate of $990,000 per annum.  Your Salary
will  be  paid  to  you  in accordance with the Company's  regular  payroll
practices  applicable to its executive officers.  Your rate of Salary  will
be  reviewed annually by the Board and may be increased by the Board on the
basis of such review.

          (b)  Bonus.

          (i)  Annual Bonus.  You shall be eligible to earn an annual bonus
(the  "Annual Bonus") for each whole or partial Fiscal Year during the Term
consisting  of the sum of (i) the Component A Bonus (as defined below)  for
that Fiscal Year and (ii) the Component B Bonus (as defined below) for such
Fiscal  Year.   The Annual Bonus for each given Fiscal Year  will  be  paid
within  90  days following the end of the Fiscal Year to which such  Annual
Bonus  relates.   The "Component A Bonus" shall be based upon  the  Company
achieving  one or more performance goals established in good faith  by  the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") and approved  by  the
Board  for  such Fiscal Year.  The performance goal or goals applicable  to
the  Component A Bonus for the Fiscal Year of the Company that includes the
Effective  Date will be established within 60 days following the  Effective
Date. The performance goals for the Component A Bonus for subsequent Fiscal
Years will be established, to the extent practicable, prior to the start of
the  applicable  Fiscal Year, but in no event later than 90 days  following
the commencement of the Fiscal Year.  The target amount of your Component A
Bonus for each 12-month Fiscal Year will equal 100% of your annual rate  of
Salary based upon the rate in effect on the first day of that Fiscal  Year.
The  target  amount  for any Fiscal Year of fewer than 12  months  will  be
prorated by multiplying the target amount determined in accordance with the
previous  sentence  by  a  fraction (in no event  greater  than  one),  the
numerator  of which is the number of days in such Fiscal Year in  the  Term
and  the  denominator  of  which is 365 ( the "Proration  Fraction").   The
actual amount of the Component A Bonus paid to you for a given Fiscal  Year
(which,  for purposes of this Agreement, will be deemed earned  as  of  the
last  day of the applicable Fiscal Year) may range from 50% to 300% of  the
target  amount,  based  upon  a  performance schedule  established  by  the
Committee  for the applicable Fiscal Year and the relationship between  the
Company's actual performance for the Fiscal Year and the target performance
established  for  that  year  by the Committee (it  being  understood  that
payments  in excess of 200% of target will be made only for extraordinarily
good  corporate performance and payments of no Component A  Bonus  will  be
made  for  only  poor corporate performance); provided, however,  that  the
minimum Component A Bonus for the first Fiscal Year ending during the  Term
shall be 50% of the target amount for that Fiscal Year.  There shall be  no
minimum  guaranteed Component A Bonus for any Fiscal Year  other  than  the
first Fiscal Year ending during the Term.  The "Component B Bonus" shall be
$1,000,000 for each Fiscal Year of the Company ending during the Term (and,
for purposes of this Agreement, will be deemed earned as of the last day of
the  applicable Fiscal Year ending during the Term).  In no event  may  the
sum  of  the Component B Bonuses paid for all Fiscal Years during the  Term
exceed  $5  million. In the event that the Company changes its Fiscal  Year
during  the  Term,  an  equitable adjustment shall be  made  to  the  bonus
arrangement which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the  Committee,
preserves, to the extent practicable, the bonus opportunity (including  the
timing of payment of the Component B Bonuses) set forth above.

           (ii)  Signing  Bonus.  In addition to any amounts payable  under
Section  3(b)(i)  above, the Company will pay you as  soon  as  practicable
following the Effective Date a one-time signing bonus of $200,000.
                                
                               24

           (c)   Loan.    On or as soon as practicable after the  Effective
Date,  the  Company shall cause one of its subsidiaries (the  "Lender")  to
lend  you  the amount of $5,000,000 (the "Loan").  The Loan shall initially
be  made  to  you on a fully recourse basis but shall, subject  to  Section
5(h),  become  nonrecourse (and thereafter remain nonrecourse)  as  to  the
portion  of  the principal amount of the Loan that is secured by collateral
with a value on the date such collateral is pledged by you equal to 125% of
the  outstanding  principal amount of the Loan.  To  the  extent  that  the
collateral  pledged  by you does not have a value  equal  to  125%  of  the
outstanding  principal amount of the Loan, the portion  of  the  Loan  that
shall be recourse shall be determined in accordance with the formula  [P  -
(C/1.25)],  where "P" is the outstanding principal amount of the  Loan  and
"C" is the fair market value of all collateral securing the Loan determined
as  of  the  date such collateral is pledged.  The collateral that  may  be
pledged  by  you   to  secure the Loan shall consist of Performance  Shares
earned  by  you  and  such other collateral as the  Lender  may  reasonably
accept.  The Company agrees to release its security interest in Performance
Shares  prior to the full repayment of the Loan to the extent necessary  to
permit  you to sell such shares in order to pay the tax liability  incurred
by  you  in connection with your earning of the Performance Shares, to  pay
any  currently due interest on the Loan or to pay any outstanding principal
amount  of  the  Loan.  The Loan shall bear interest at  the  minimum  rate
necessary  to  avoid the imputation of interest under the  Code.   Interest
shall compound and be payable annually on each anniversary of the Effective
Date  and  on  the date of your termination or resignation  of  employment.
Twenty  per cent of the initial principal amount of the Loan shall  be  due
and  payable  on  each  of  the first through fifth  anniversaries  of  the
Effective  Date.  The entire principal amount of the Loan and  any  accrued
but  unpaid  interest on the Loan shall be immediately due and  payable  90
days  following the Date of Termination (as hereinafter defined).  You  may
prepay  some or all of the principal amount of the Loan and any portion  of
the accrued but unpaid interest on the Loan at any time without premium  or
penalty.  Repayments of principal and interest on the Loan shall be applied
ratably at the time of payment to the recourse and nonrecourse portions  of
the  Loan.  Following your termination or resignation of employment for any
reason,  the Company and the Lender shall have the unconditional  right  to
reduce  any  payments owed to you hereunder by the amount of  any  due  and
unpaid  principal and interest on the Loan and you hereby agree and consent
to such right on the part of the Company and the Lender.  As a condition to
making the Loan to you, you shall execute a promissory note in favor of the
Lender  and  any  other applicable Loan documentation consistent  with  the
terms of this Section 3(c) which is reasonably requested by the Lender.

           (d)   Benefits.   During  the Term, you  shall  be  eligible  to
participate  in all welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements  that
the  Company  provides to its executive employees in  accordance  with  the
terms  of such plans and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable  to
you,  in  the aggregate, than the terms and provisions available  to  other
executive  employees  of  the Company.  Subject  to  your  insurability  at
standard  commercial rates, in lieu of your participating in the  Company's
regular  life  insurance programs, the Company agrees to maintain  a  whole
life insurance policy for you during the Term with a death benefit equal to
5  times  your annual rate of Salary.  The whole life policy  shall  be  on
terms which are substantially similar to those applicable to the whole life
policy in effect with your prior employer (including the provisions thereof
applicable to the allocation of premiums on the policy between you and  the
Company).

          (e)  Expenses.  The Company will reimburse you in accordance with
its  regular  policies  and  practices  for  business  expenses  reasonably
incurred  by  you in connection with the performance of your  duties  under
this  Agreement, subject to your presentation of appropriate  documentation
of such expenses.

           (f)   Airplane Lease.  The Company agrees to lease your  current
airplane  for business purposes on terms which are commercially  reasonable
to you and the Company. The terms of such airplane lease will be negotiated
in  good faith by you and the Company after the Effective Date and will  be
memorialized in appropriate documentation.
                              25

           4.    Long-Term Incentive Compensation.  In order to align  your
interests  more  closely  with  those of the  Company's  stockholders,  the
Company   will   offer  the  following  long-term  incentive   compensation
arrangements to you, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

           (a)   Stock Option.  Subject to Section 4(c) below, as  soon  as
practicable  after  the  Effective Date, the  Company  will  grant  to  you
pursuant  to  the Apple Computer, Inc. 1990 Stock Option Plan (the  "Option
Plan")  a  stock option (the "Option") covering 1,000,000 shares of  common
stock of the Company (the "Common Stock").  The per share exercise price of
the Option shall be the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the
day  before  the  date the Option is granted to you by  the  Committee,  as
determined  in  accordance with the provisions of  the  Option  Plan.   The
Option  shall  become vested and exercisable with respect  to  20%  of  the
shares  of Common Stock subject thereto on the Initial Vesting Date and  on
each  of  the  second  through fifth anniversaries of the  Effective  Date,
provided that you have remained in the continuous full-time employ  of  the
Company  through  each such vesting date and stockholder  approval  of  the
grant of the Option is obtained in accordance with Section 4(c) below.  The
Option  will be subject to the terms and provisions of the Option Plan  and
such  other  terms  consistent with the Option Plan as  the  Committee  may
specify and set forth in the applicable Option Agreement.

          (b)  Performance Shares.  (i)  Subject to Section 4(c) below, for
each Fiscal Year during the Term, you shall be afforded the opportunity  to
earn  the  Target Amount (as defined below) of shares of Common Stock  (the
"Performance  Shares"), subject to the Company's attaining the  performance
goal  or  goals established in good faith by the Committee and approved  by
the  Board  for  that  Fiscal  Year (hereinafter,  the  "Performance  Share
Arrangement").   The "Target Amount" for each 12-month Fiscal  Year  during
the  Term shall be 200,000 shares of Common Stock.  The "Target Amount" for
each  Fiscal  Year  of the Term of fewer than 12 months  shall  be  200,000
shares of Common Stock multiplied by the Proration Fraction.   In no  event
may you have the opportunity to earn more than 1,000,000 Performance Shares
during the Term.  The performance goal or goals for first Fiscal Year  will
be   established  within  60  days  following  the  Effective  Date.    The
performance goals for subsequent Fiscal Years will be established,  to  the
extent  practicable, prior to the start of the applicable Fiscal Year,  but
in no event later than 90 days following the start of the Fiscal Year.  The
performance  goal or goals established by the Committee for a given  Fiscal
Year  need not be the same goal or goals established by the Committee under
Section 3(b) above.  You may earn fewer than the full number of Performance
Shares  in a given year for performance that is below target for that  year
based  upon an award schedule established by the Committee at the  time  it
sets  the performance targets for the year.  In the event that the  Company
changes  its Fiscal Year during the Term, an equitable adjustment shall  be
made  to  the  Performance Share Arrangement which, in the reasonable  good
faith judgment of the Committee, preserves, to the extent practicable,  the
long-term incentive opportunity set forth above.

           (ii)  The Performance Shares earned by you for the first  Fiscal
Year  will  be  deemed  earned  on the Initial  Vesting  Date  (subject  to
applicable performance targets being achieved) and will be awarded  to  you
as  soon  as practicable following the Initial Vesting Date, provided  that
you have remained in the continuous full-time employ of the Company through
that  date.   The  Performance Shares for the second Fiscal  Year  will  be
awarded  to you on the Initial Vesting Date (provided you are then employed
by  the Company), but will be forfeited in whole or in part as of the  last
day of that Fiscal Year if the performance goal or goals applicable to that
year  are not achieved.  The Performance Shares for each subsequent  Fiscal
Year  will  be  awarded  to you as of the first  day  of  the  Fiscal  Year
(provided  you are then employed by the Company), but will be forfeited  in
whole  or in part as of the last day of that Fiscal Year if the performance
goal or goals applicable to that year are not achieved.  Performance Shares
will  not  be transferrable by you until they have been earned  by  you  in
accordance  with  the provisions of this Section 4(b).  Performance  Shares
awarded  for Fiscal Years during the Term other than the first Fiscal  Year
will  be issued in your name, but the share certificates representing  such
shares will be held by the Company or its agent until they have been earned
in  accordance with the provisions of this Section 4(b) and  will  bear  an
appropriate  legend  or  legends reflecting the transfer  restrictions  and
forfeiture provisions applicable thereto.

          (iii)     In the event of a Change in Control of the Company, the
Company   shall  make  equitable  adjustments  to  the  Performance   Share
Arrangement  in an manner intended to preserve the economic  value  of  the
arrangement;  provided, however, that, in the event  of  a  merger  of  the
Company with or into another corporation, such adjustment shall consist  of
a conversion of Performance Shares to be earned under the Performance Share
Arrangement into shares of the surviving corporation in accordance with the
exchange  ratio  approved by the Company's stockholders  and  an  equitable
adjustment  to  the  performance goals applicable to the Performance  Share
Arrangement.

           (c)  Stockholder Approval.  The grant of the Option is expressly
conditioned  upon the stockholders of the Company approving in  a  separate
vote  of  the  stockholders  at  the first annual  or  special  meeting  of
stockholders of the Company to occur after the Effective Date (i) the grant
of  the  Option and (ii) an amendment to the Option Plan to  permit  it  to
comply  with  the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code applicable  to
qualified performance-based compensation.   If such stockholder approval is
not  obtained  in  the  manner contemplated by the previous  sentence,  the
Option  grant shall be void ab initio and of no further force  and  effect.
Similarly, the Performance Share Arrangement is expressly conditioned  upon
the  stockholders  of  the Company approving in  a  separate  vote  of  the
stockholders at the first annual or special meeting of stockholders of  the
Company to occur after the Effective Date the Performance Share Arrangement
and such additional terms as shall be necessary for the arrangement to meet
the  requirements  of  Section 162(m) of the Code applicable  to  qualified
performance-based  compensation.   If  such  stockholder  approval  is  not
obtained  in  the  manner  contemplated  by  the  previous  sentence,   any
outstanding  Performance  Shares shall be  immediately  forfeited  and  the
Performance  Share Arrangement shall be void ab initio and  of  no  further
force and effect.  If the stockholder approval contemplated by this Section
4(c) is not obtained, you and the Company agree to negotiate an alternative
long-term compensation arrangement to be submitted to stockholders  and  to
submit  such alternative long-term compensation arrangement to stockholders
as soon as reasonably practicable, and to repeat this process to the extent
necessary   until   an   alternative  long-term  compensation   arrangement
negotiated  by  you  and  the  Company  is  subsequently  approved  by  the
stockholders.  You and the Company agree to make a good faith and  diligent
effort to obtain the stockholder approval contemplated by this Section 4(c)
as soon as reasonably possible.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding,  the Company shall have no obligation to  call  a  special
meeting   of  stockholders  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  any  approval
contemplated by this Section 4(c).

            (d)   Registration;  Reservation  of  Shares.   To  the  extent
practicable, the Company will undertake to register the Option, the  shares
of Common Stock underlying the Option and the Performance Shares on Form S-
8  under the Securities Act.  The previous sentence, however, shall not  in
any  way be construed as (i) prohibiting the Company from engaging  in  any
transaction  (including  a transaction that will  result  in  a  Change  in
Control), (ii) requiring the Company to file any reports under the Exchange
Act  or  to  maintain  its  registration under the  Exchange  Act  if  such
registration  is not otherwise required or (iii) requiring the registration
of  the  Option, the shares of Common Stock underlying the  Option  or  the
Performance  Shares  on Form S-8 (or any other form) if  Form  S-8  is  not
available  to the Company.  As soon as practicable following the  Effective
Date,  the  Company shall reserve for issuance 1,000,000 shares  of  Common
Stock  for  issuance under the Performance Share Arrangement.  As  soon  as
practicable  following the Effective Date, the Company  shall  reserve  for
issuance  1,000,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance  under  the  Option
Plan in connection with the grant of the Option.

          5.   Effect of Termination of Employment.

           (a)  Right to Resign Following a Year One Change in Control.  In
the  event  of  a Year One Change in Control, you shall have the  right  to
resign  for any reason or for no stated reason during the Election  Window.
In  the  event  of such a resignation, the Company shall pay you  the  full
amount of the accrued but unpaid Salary you have earned through the Date of
Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of your  rate  of
Salary  then  in effect) for all unused vacation time which  you  may  have
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  In addition, the Company shall  pay
you  on the Severance Payment Date an "all in" cash lump sum payment of $10
million.   You will relinquish, as of the Date of Termination, the  Option,
all  rights  under  the Performance Share Arrangement and  any  outstanding
Performance  Shares  and the right to any additional payments  or  benefits
from  the Company under this Agreement.  The provisions of the Section 5(a)
shall  not  apply  if,  at  the time of your resignation,  the  Company  is
entitled to terminate your employment for Cause.

           (b)   Involuntary Termination Prior to the Initial Vesting Date.
In  the  event of your Involuntary Termination prior to the Initial Vesting
Date,  the Company shall pay you the full amount of the accrued but  unpaid
Salary you have earned through the Date of Termination, plus a cash payment
(calculated  on  the basis of your rate of Salary then in effect)  for  all
unused  vacation  time  which  you may have  accrued  as  of  the  Date  of
Termination.   In  addition, the Company shall pay  you  on  the  Severance
Payment  Date an "all in" cash lump sum payment of $10 million.   You  will
relinquish as of the Date of Termination the Option, all rights  under  the
Performance  Share Arrangement and any outstanding Performance  Shares  and
the  right  to  any additional payments or benefits from the Company  under
this Agreement.

           (c)   Involuntary  Termination On or After the  Initial  Vesting
Date.   (i)   In the event of your Involuntary Termination on or after  the
Initial  Vesting  Date, the Company shall pay you the full  amount  of  the
accrued  but  unpaid  Salary  you have earned  through  the  date  of  such
Involuntary  Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the  basis  of
your rate of Salary then in effect) for all unused vacation time which  you
may  have  accrued as of the date of Involuntary Termination.  In addition,
the  Company  shall pay you on the Severance Payment Date a cash  lump  sum
amount  equal to the sum of (i) the Salary payable to you for the remaining
portion  of the Term and (ii) your annual rate of Salary (at the rate  then
in  effect) times the number of whole and partial Contract Years  remaining
in  the  Term. In the event of an Involuntary Termination on or  after  the
Initial Vesting Date, you will retain all Performance Shares that have been
earned  by you on or prior to the date of such Involuntary Termination  and
you  will  continue to have the opportunity to earn the Performance  Shares
for  the  Fiscal Year in which the Involuntary Termination  occurs  if  the
applicable  performance goals for that Fiscal Year are achieved;  provided,
however,  that, if your employment is Involuntarily Terminated  (i)  on  or
after  the  Initial Vesting Date and (ii) on or after a Change  in  Control
(other  than  a Year One Change in Control), then the number of Performance
Shares  you shall earn for the Fiscal Year in which the Date of Termination
occurs shall not be less than the Target Amount for that Fiscal Year (in no
event  greater than 200,000) multiplied by a fraction (in no event  greater
than one), the numerator of which is the number of days in such Fiscal Year
up to and including the Date of Termination and the denominator of which is
365  (the  "Change  in  Control Fraction").   All other  rights  under  the
Performance Share Arrangement and all other outstanding Performance  Shares
will  be  forfeited  as of the Date of Termination.  You  will  retain  the
portion  of  the  Option  that  has vested on  or  prior  to  the  Date  of
Termination.  In addition,  if your employment is Involuntarily  Terminated
(i)  on or after the Initial Vesting Date and (ii) on or after a Change  in
Control  (other than a Year One Change in Control), you shall also vest  in
an  additional portion of the Option on the Date of Termination  determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock in which the Option was
scheduled to vest on the anniversary of the Effective Date occurring on  or
immediately  following  the Date of Termination by the  Change  in  Control
Fraction.  The vested portion of the Option will remain exercisable for  90
days following the Date of Termination.  Any remaining unvested portion  of
the Option will be forfeited as of the Date of Termination.
                                
                               28
<PAGE>

          (ii) In the event of your Involuntary Termination on or after the
Initial Vesting Date, you and your eligible dependents shall continue to be
eligible  to  participate  during  the  Benefit  Continuation  Period   (as
hereinafter  defined)  in the medical, dental, health  and  life  insurance
plans  applicable to you immediately prior to your Involuntary  Termination
on  the  same  terms and conditions in effect for you and  your  dependents
immediately  prior to such Involuntary Termination.  For  purposes  of  the
previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation Period" means the period beginning
on  the date of Date of Termination and ending on the first anniversary  of
the  Date of Termination; provided, however, that your coverage under  such
plans  and  arrangements shall end on the date that you and your dependents
are  eligible  and elect coverage under the plans of a subsequent  employer
which provide substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you and  your
dependents.   Following  the end of the Benefit  Continuation  Period,  you
shall  be  eligible to elect any applicable "continuation  coverage"  under
Section 4980B(f) of the Code as if the last day of the Benefit Continuation
Period  was  the  date  of your "qualifying event"  for  such  continuation
coverage.

           (iii)     Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(c),  as
of the Date of Termination, you will relinquish the right to any additional
payments or benefits from the Company under this Agreement.

           (d)  Termination for Cause; Resignation Without Good Reason.  In
the  event  you  resign without Good Reason or you are  terminated  by  the
Company  for Cause at any time during the Term, the Company shall  pay  you
the  full  amount of the accrued but unpaid Salary you have earned  through
the  Date  of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis  of
your rate of Salary then in effect) for all unused vacation time which  you
may  have  accrued  as  of the Date of Termination.  You  will  immediately
forfeit  as  of  the Date of Termination the then unvested portion  of  the
Option,  all future rights under the Performance Share Arrangement and  any
outstanding Performance Shares that have not been earned as of the Date  of
Termination.  You will retain the portion of the Option that has vested  on
or  prior to the Date of Termination which will remain exercisable  for  90
days following the Date of Termination.  In addition, you shall immediately
relinquish  the  right  to any additional payments  or  benefits  from  the
Company under this Agreement.

           (e)   Death or Disability.  If your employment with the  Company
ends  as  a result of your death or Disability during the Term, the Company
shall  pay you (or, in the event of your death, your Beneficiary) the  full
amount  of  the accrued but unpaid base salary you have earned through  the
Date  of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis of  your
rate  of Salary then in effect) for all unused vacation time which you  may
have accrued as of the Date of Termination.   In the event of your death or
Disability,  you  (or  in the event of your death, your  Beneficiary)  will
retain all Performance Shares that have been earned on or prior to the date
of  your  death or Disability and you (or in the event of your death,  your
Beneficiary) will continue to have the opportunity to earn the  Performance
Shares  for the Fiscal Year in which the Involuntary Termination occurs  if
the  applicable performance goals for that Fiscal Year are  achieved.   All
other  rights  under the Performance Share Arrangement  or  and  all  other
outstanding  Performance  Shares  will be  forfeited  as  of  the  Date  of
Termination.  You will retain the portion of the Option that has vested  on
or  prior  to  the  Date  of Termination which will remain  exercisable  in
accordance  with  the provisions of the Option Plan.  In addition,  in  the
event  of  your death, the Option will continue to vest in accordance  with
the provisions of the Option Plan during the six-month period beginning  on
the  date of your death.  Any remaining portion of the Option which has not
vested by the end of the period described in the previous sentence will  be
forfeited.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(e),  as  of  the
Date  of  Termination,  you will relinquish the  right  to  any  additional
payments or benefits from the Company under this Agreement.

           (f)   Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination  of  your
employment  by the Company or by you during the Term shall be  communicated
by  a  notice  of  termination to the other party hereto  (the  "Notice  of
Termination").   The  Notice  of Termination shall  indicate  the  specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth  in
reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide  a  basis
for  termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.   The
date   of  your  termination  of  employment  with  the  Company  and   its
subsidiaries  (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined  as  follows:
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a  Notice of Termination is delivered to you by the Company (provided  that
you  shall  not have returned to the full-time performance of  your  duties
during such thirty (30) day period),  (ii) if your employment is terminated
by  the  Company  in  an Involuntary Termination, the date  the  Notice  of
Termination is delivered to you by the Company, (iii) if your employment is
terminated  by  the  Company  for Cause, subject  to  the  applicable  cure
provisions,  the  date such notice is delivered to you by the  Company  and
(iv)  if  you  resign during the Election Window, the date  the  Notice  of
Termination  is  delivered to the Company by you.  If the  basis  for  your
Involuntary  Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, the  Date  of
Termination shall be, subject to the applicable cure provisions,  ten  (10)
days  after the date your Notice of Termination is delivered to the Company
by you.  The Date of Termination for a resignation of employment other than
for Good Reason other than during the Election Window shall be the date the
Notice  of  Termination is delivered to you by the Company.   The  Date  of
Termination in the event of your death shall be the date of your death.  If
your employment ends as a result of the expiration of the Term, the Date of
Termination shall be the last day of the Term.

           (g)   No Mitigation.  You shall not be required to mitigate  the
amount  of  any  payment provided for in this Agreement  by  seeking  other
employment  or  otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment  or  benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you
as the result of employment by another employer.

          (h)  Right of Setoff.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding,  upon your termination or resignation of  employment  with
the  Company  for any reason, the full amount of the outstanding  principal
and interest on the Loan shall become due and payable 90 days following the
applicable  Date of Termination, and the Company and the Lender shall  have
the right to apply any and all amounts payable to you under this Section  5
(or  otherwise payable to you under this Agreement) to the payment  of  the
full  amount  of the then outstanding principal and interest on  the  Loan.
You  hereby  consent  to such action by the Company and hereby  irrevocably
designate the Company as your agent for purposes of the Loan repayment  and
authorize  and  direct  the  Company  to  repay  the  Loan  in  the  manner
contemplated  by  this Section 5(h).  Any remaining amount  of  outstanding
principal and interest that is not paid in the manner contemplated by  this
Section  5(h) shall be due and payable by you within 90 days following  the
applicable Date of Termination.

          6.   Additional Payment.

           (a)   Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the
contrary,  if  it is determined that any Payment would be  subject  to  the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties
with  respect  to  such  excise tax (such excise  tax,  together  with  any
interest  or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise  Tax"),
then  you shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")
in  an  amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic  position
that  you  would  have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had  not  applied  to  the
Payment.   The  amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined  by  the
Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula {(E  x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E}
(or such other formula as the Accounting  Firm deems appropriate which is 
intended to achieve the same result), where
                               30
<PAGE>
     
          E    equals the Payments which are determined to be "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1)
               of the Code;
     
          M    equals  the  sum  of the highest marginal rates1  for  Taxes
               applicable to you at the time of the Payment; and

          T    equals  M  plus  the  rate of Excise Tax applicable  to  the
               Payment.

            (b)   Determination  of  Gross-Up  Payment.   Subject  to   the
provisions of Section 5(c), all determinations required under this  Section
6,  including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the  amount  of  the
Payments  constituting excess parachute payments, and  the  amount  of  the
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen
days  of  the  Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination  after  the
Change in Control Date or any other date reasonably requested by you or the
Company  on  which  a determination under this Section 6  is  necessary  or
advisable.   The  Company  shall pay to you the  initial  Gross-Up  Payment
within  5  days  of  the receipt by you and the Company of  the  Accounting
Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax
is  payable by you, the Company shall cause the Accounting Firm to  provide
you  with  an  opinion  that the Accounting Firm has substantial  authority
under  the Code and Regulations not to report an Excise Tax on your federal
income  tax  return.   Any determination by the Accounting  Firm  shall  be
binding  upon  you  and the Company.  If the initial  Gross-Up  Payment  is
insufficient  to  cover  the amount of the Excise Tax  that  is  ultimately
determined  to be owing by you with respect to any Payment (hereinafter  an
"Underpayment"), the Company, after exhausting its remedies  under  Section
6(c)  below,  shall promptly pay to you an additional Gross-Up  Payment  in
respect of the Underpayment.

           (c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim  by  the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would  require
the  payment  by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice  shall  be
given as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise
the  Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim  is
requested  to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration
of  the  thirty-day  period following the date  on  which  you  notify  the
Company,  or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in
writing  prior  to the expiration of the Notice Period that it  desires  to
contest  the  claim,  you  shall:  (i) give  the  Company  any  information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii)  take  such
action  in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with  respect
to  such  claim  by  an attorney reasonably selected  by  the  Company  and
reasonably  acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with  the  Company  in  good
faith  in  contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate
in  any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings  and  conferences with the taxing authority  in  respect  of  such
claim.   If  requested  by the Company, you agree either  to  pay  the  tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner
and  to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal,  in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more  appellate
courts  as  the Company shall determine; provided, however,  that,  if  the
Company  directs  you  to pay such claim and pursue a refund,  the  Company
shall  advance  the  amount of such payment to  you  on  an  after-tax  and
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the  contest
related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
any other issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or other
                                
                               31

taxing  authority.  If the Company does not notify you in writing prior  to
the  end  of  the  Notice Period of its desire to contest  the  claim,  the
Company shall pay to you an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect  of  the
excess parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and you  agree
to pay the amount of the Excise Tax that is the subject of the claim to the
applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an  Advance,  you
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together  with
any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after  receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall
not  be  entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and  the  Company
does not promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid  by  you
and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up
Payment then owing to you.

           (e)   Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify  you  and
hold  you  harmless,  on  an  after-tax basis, from  any  costs,  expenses,
penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by  you
with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this
Section  6,  including,  without limitation,  any  Losses  related  to  the
Company's  decision  to  contest a claim  or  any  imputed  income  to  you
resulting  from any Advance or action taken on your behalf by  the  Company
hereunder.   The  Company shall pay all legal fees  and  expenses  incurred
under  this  Section 6, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  you in connection with any  actions  taken  by  the
Company  or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The Company shall  also
pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without
limitation,  the fees and expenses related to the opinion  referred  to  in
Section 6(b).

          7.   Successors; Binding Agreement; Attorneys Fees.

           (a)   Assumption  by Successor.  The Company  will  require  any
successor  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,  consolidation
or  otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company expressly to assume and to agree in writing, with a copy to you, to
perform  this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that  the
Company  would  be required to perform it if no such succession  had  taken
place; provided, however, that no such assumption shall relieve the Company
of  its  obligations hereunder.  As used in this Agreement,  the  "Company"
shall  mean  the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor  to  its
business  and/or  assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees  to  perform
this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.

           (b)   Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This  Agreement  shall  be
binding   upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  you  (and  your  personal
representatives  and  heirs)  and the Company and  any  organization  which
succeeds  to  substantially all of the business or assets of  the  Company,
whether  by  means  of  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of   all   or
substantially  all  of  the assets of the Company or otherwise,  including,
without  limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by operation  of
law.   This  Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by
your   personal   or  legal  representatives,  executors,   administrators,
successors,   heirs,   distributees,  devisees  and   legatees   or   other
Beneficiary.  If you should die while any amount would still be payable  to
you  hereunder  if  you  had continued to live, all  such  amounts,  unless
otherwise  provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the  terms  of
this Agreement to your Beneficiary.

           (c)  Attorney's Fees.  The Company will pay or reimburse you for
the  reasonable  attorneys  fees  and  expenses  incurred  by  you  in  the
negotiation of this Agreement in an amount not to exceed $5,000.

           8.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following

identifies  the  manner  in  which the Board believes  that  you  have  not
substantially  performed  your  duties,  and  which  performance   is   not

requirement;  provided, however, that, anything in this  Agreement  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, a Change in Control  shall  be  deemed  to  have
occurred if:

          (i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,

     election  by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote  of  at
     least a majority of the directors then still in office who either were
     directors  at  the  beginning  of the  period  or  whose  election  or
     nomination  for  election was previously so approved,  cease  for  any
     reason to constitute a majority thereof;
     
          (iii)     there occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
     other  corporate  transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),

     immediately  prior to such Transaction do not, immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power  of
     the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;

detrimental  alteration  in  your  position,  titles,  responsibilities  or
reporting  responsibilities from that contemplated  under  this  Agreement;
provided, however, that a change in your position, titles, responsibilities
or  reporting responsibilities as a result of or in connection with a  Year
One  Change  in  Control shall not constitute an event of Good  Reason  for

Share  Arrangement shall in no event constitute Good Reason hereunder;  and
provided  further,  that  an event described in  this  sentence  shall  not
constitute  Good Reason unless it is communicated by you to the Company  in
writing  within thirty days of the date you know or have reason to know  of

by  either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto
of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to  be

dissimilar  provisions  or  conditions at the  same  or  at  any  prior  or
subsequent  time.   No agreements or representations,  oral  or  otherwise,
express  or  implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof  have  been
made  by  either party which are not expressly set forth in this  Agreement
and  this  Agreement  shall  supersede all prior agreements,  negotiations,
correspondence,  undertakings and communications of the  parties,  oral  or
written, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that

accrued salary, vacation,  guaranteed bonus during Fiscal Year 1996 only or

provided  herein,  shall  be paid in accordance  with  the  terms  of  this
Agreement   to   your   personal   or  legal  representatives,   executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and  legatees  or
other beneficiary.

and effect.

           (d)   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed  in  several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original  but  all  of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

                                                              March 4, 1996

                     Retention Agreement
                              
                              
Dear Fred:

           Apple Computer, Inc., a California corporation  (the "Company"),
considers  it essential to the best interests of its stockholders  to  take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that the uncertainty  and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change  in
control  of  the  Company could result in the departure or  distraction  of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.

           The  Board  has  determined, therefore, that  appropriate  steps
should  be  taken  to reinforce and encourage the continued  attention  and
dedication   of  members  of  the  management  of  the  Company   and   its
subsidiaries,   including  yourself,  to  their  assigned  duties   without
distraction  in  the  face of potentially disturbing circumstances  arising
from any possible change in control of the Company.

           In  order to induce you to remain in the employ of the  Company,
the  Company  has  determined  to enter into this  letter  agreement  (this
"Agreement") which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in
the  event of a change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words  which
are  not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to  such
words in Section 8 of this Agreement.

           1.    Term of Employment Under the Agreement.  The term of  your
employment  under  this Agreement shall commence on the Change  in  Control
Date  and  shall  continue until the second anniversary of  the  Change  in
Control Date (the "Term").

           2.   Employment During the Term.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company:

          (a)  Titles; Reporting and Duties.  Your position, titles, nature
and  status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no  less
favorable  to  you  than those that you enjoyed immediately  prior  to  the
Change in Control Date.

           (b)   Salary  and  Bonus.   Your base salary  and  annual  bonus
opportunity  may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.

            (c)    Incentive  Compensation.   You  shall  be  eligible   to
participate in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established  by
the  Company for its executive employees, in accordance with the terms  and
provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent  with  the
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.
                             48
<PAGE>

           (d)   Benefits.   You  shall be eligible to participate  in  all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides  to its executive employees in accordance with the terms  of  such
plans  and  arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you,  in  the
aggregate,  than  the  terms and provisions available  to  other  executive
employees of the Company.

           (e)  Location.  You will continue to be employed at the business
location at which you were employed prior to the Change in Control Date and
the  amount  of time that you are required to travel for business  purposes
will  not  be  increased  in any significant respect  from  the  amount  of
business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.

          3.   Involuntary Termination During the Term.

           (a)   Severance  Payment.   In the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within 5 days of the
date  of  such  Involuntary Termination the full amount of any  earned  but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at
the  time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated  on
the  basis of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you
may have accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay
you  within  5  days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion  of  the
annual  bonus  for  the year in which your Involuntary Termination  occurs,
calculated  on  the basis of your target bonus for that  year  and  on  the
assumption that all performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In
addition,  the  Company shall pay you in a cash lump  sum,  within  8  days
following the date of your execution of the release described in  the  last
sentence of this Section 3(a) (or on the Date of Termination, if later), an
amount  (the  "Severance Payment") equal to the sum of (i) two  times  your
Reference  Salary and (ii) one times your Reference Bonus.   The  Severance
Payment  shall  be in lieu of any other severance payments  which  you  are
entitled  to  receive  under any other severance pay  plan  or  arrangement
sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries.  Your right to the Severance
Payment  shall be conditioned upon your execution of a release in favor  of
the  Company  in  substantially the form of the release  required  for  the
receipt of severance payments under the Severance Plan (as in effect on the
date  of  this Agreement) which is not revoked by you within the  seven-day
revocation period specified therein.

            (b)   Benefit  Payment.   In  the  event  of  your  Involuntary
Termination  during  the  Term,  you and  your  eligible  dependents  shall
continue  to  be  eligible to participate during the  Benefit  Continuation
Period  (as hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health,  life  and
other  fringe benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you  immediately
prior  to your Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions  in
effect  for  you and your dependents immediately prior to such  Involuntary
Termination.   For purposes of the previous sentence, "Benefit Continuation
Period" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and ending on
the  earlier  to  occur  of  (i) the second  anniversary  of  the  Date  of
Termination and (ii) the date that you and your dependents are eligible and
elect  coverage  under  the plans of a subsequent  employer  which  provide
substantially equivalent or greater benefits to you and your dependents.

           (c)   Date and Notice of Termination.  Any termination  of  your
employment  by the Company or by you during the Term shall be  communicated
by  a  notice  of  termination to the other party hereto  (the  "Notice  of
Termination").   The  Notice  of Termination shall  indicate  the  specific
termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth  in
reasonable  detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide  a  basis
for  termination of your employment under the provision so indicated.   The
date   of  your  termination  of  employment  with  the  Company  and   its
subsidiaries  (the "Date of Termination") shall be determined  as  follows:
(i) if your employment is terminated for Disability, thirty (30) days after
a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall not have returned
to  the  full-time performance of your duties during such thirty  (30)  day
period),  (ii)  if  your employment is terminated  by  the  Company  in  an
Involuntary  Termination,  five (5) days  after  the  date  the  Notice  of
Termination  is received by you and (iii) if your employment is  terminated
by the Company for Cause, the later of the  date specified in the Notice of
                             49
<PAGE>

Termination or ten (10) days following the date such notice is received  by
you.  If the basis  for your Involuntary  Termination  is  your resignation 
for Good Reason, the Date of  Termination shall  be  ten  (10)  days  after 
the date your  Notice  of  Termination  is received  by  the Company.   The 
Date of Termination for a  resignation  of  employment  other than for Good 
Reason shall be  the date set forth  in  the applicable notice, which shall 
be no earlier than ten (10) days after  the date such notice is received by 
the Company.

           (d)   No  Mitigation or Offset.  You shall not  be  required  to
mitigate  the  amount  of any payment provided for  in  this  Agreement  by
seeking  other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment
or  benefit  provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any  compensation
earned by you as the result of employment by another employer or by pension
benefits  paid  by  the  Company or another  employer  after  the  Date  of
Termination or otherwise except as specifically provided in clause (ii)  of
the last sentence of Section 3(b).

          4.   Additional Payment.

           (a)   Gross-Up Payment.  Notwithstanding anything herein to  the
contrary,  if  it is determined that any Payment would be  subject  to  the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties
with  respect  to  such  excise tax (such excise  tax,  together  with  any
interest  or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as an "Excise  Tax"),
then  you shall be entitled to an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment")
in  an  amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic  position
that  you  would  have enjoyed if the Excise Tax had  not  applied  to  the
Payment.   The  amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be determined  by  the
Accounting Firm in accordance with the formula
{(E  x (1 - M)/(1 - T)) - E} (or such other formula as the Accounting  Firm
deems appropriate which is intended to achieve the same result), where

          E    equals  the  Payments  which are determined  to  be  "excess
               parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1)
               of the Code;
     
          M    equals the sum of the highest marginal ratesTo be
               expressed in up to three decimal places.  For example, a
               combined federal, state and local marginal rate of 56% would
               be expressed as .560. for Taxes applicable to you at the
               time of the Payment; and

          T    equals  M  plus  the  rate of Excise Tax applicable  to  the
               Payment.

No  Gross-Up  Payments shall be payable hereunder if  the  Accounting  Firm
determines that the Payments are not subject to an Excise Tax.

            (b)   Determination  of  Gross-Up  Payment.   Subject  to   the
provisions of Section 4(c), all determinations required under this  Section
4,  including  whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, the  amount  of  the
Payments  constituting excess parachute payments, and  the  amount  of  the
Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the Accounting Firm, which shall provide
detailed supporting calculations both to you and the Company within fifteen
days  of the Change in Control Date, your Date of Termination or any  other
date  reasonably  requested by you or the Company on which a  determination
under  this Section 4 is necessary or advisable.  The Company shall pay  to
you  the  initial Gross-Up Payment within 5 days of the receipt by you  and
the Company of the Accounting Firm's determination.  If the Accounting Firm
determines  that no Excise Tax is payable by you, the Company  shall  cause
the Accounting Firm to provide you with an opinion that the Accounting Firm
has substantial authority under  the Code and  Regulations not to report an 
                             50
<PAGE>

Excise Tax on your federal  income  tax  return.   Any determination by the 
Accounting  Firm  shall  be binding  upon   you  and  the Company.   If the 
initial  Gross-Up  Payment  is  insufficient  to  cover  the  amount of the 
Excise Tax  that  is  ultimately determined to be owing by you with respect 
to  any  Payment  (hereinafter   an  "Underpayment"),  the  Company,  after 
exhausting its remedies  under  Section 4(c)  below,  shall promptly pay to 
you an additional Gross-Up  Payment  in respect of the Underpayment.

           (c)  Procedures.  You shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim  by  the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would  require
the  payment  by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment.  Such notice  shall  be
given as soon as practicable after you know of such claim and shall apprise
the  Company of the nature of the claim and the date on which the claim  is
requested  to be paid.  You agree not to pay the claim until the expiration
of  the  thirty-day  period following the date  on  which  you  notify  the
Company,  or such shorter period ending on the date the Taxes with  respect
to such claim are due (the "Notice Period"). If the Company notifies you in
writing  prior  to the expiration of the Notice Period that it  desires  to
contest  the  claim,  you  shall:  (i) give  the  Company  any  information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to the claim; (ii)  take  such
action  in connection with the claim as the Company may reasonably request,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with  respect
to  such  claim  by  an attorney reasonably selected  by  the  Company  and
reasonably  acceptable to you; (iii) cooperate with  the  Company  in  good
faith  in  contesting the claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate
in  any proceedings relating to the claim.  You shall permit the Company to
control all proceedings related to the claim and, at its option, permit the
Company to pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings,  and  conferences with the taxing authority in  respect  of  such
claim.   If  requested  by the Company, you agree either  to  pay  the  tax
claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner
and  to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative
tribunal,  in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more  appellate
courts  as  the Company shall determine; provided, however,  that,  if  the
Company  directs  you  to pay such claim and pursue a refund,  the  Company
shall  advance  the  amount of such payment to  you  on  an  after-tax  and
interest-free basis (the "Advance").  The Company's control of the  contest
related to the claim shall be limited to the issues related to the Gross-Up
Payment and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be,
any  other  issues raised by the Internal Revenue Service or  other  taxing
authority.  If the Company does not notify you in writing prior to the  end
of  the Notice Period of its desire to contest the claim, the Company shall
pay  to  you  an  additional  Gross-Up Payment in  respect  of  the  excess
parachute payments that are the subject of the claim, and you agree to  pay
the  amount  of  the Excise Tax that is the subject of  the  claim  to  the
applicable taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

           (d)   Repayments.  If, after receipt by you of an  Advance,  you
become entitled to a refund with respect to the claim to which such Advance
relates, you shall pay the Company the amount of the refund (together  with
any interest paid or credited thereon after Taxes applicable thereto).  If,
after  receipt by you of an Advance, a determination is made that you shall
not  be  entitled to any refund with respect to the claim and  the  Company
does not promptly notify you of its intent to contest the denial of refund,
then  the amount of the Advance shall not be required to be repaid  by  you
and  the  amount thereof shall offset the amount of the additional Gross-Up
Payment then owing to you.

           (e)   Further Assurances.  The Company shall indemnify  you  and
hold  you  harmless,  on  an  after-tax basis, from  any  costs,  expenses,
penalties, fines, interest or other liabilities ("Losses") incurred by  you
with respect to the exercise by the Company of any of its rights under this
Section  4,  including,  without limitation,  any  Losses  related  to  the
Company's  decision  to  contest a claim  or  any  imputed  income  to  you
resulting  from any Advance or action taken on your behalf by  the  Company
hereunder.   The  Company shall pay all legal fees  and  expenses  incurred
under  this  Section 4, and shall promptly reimburse you for the reasonable
expenses  incurred  by  you in connection with any  actions  taken  by  the
Company  or required to be taken by you hereunder.  The Company shall  also
pay all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm, including, without
limitation,  the fees and expenses related to the opinion  referred  to  in
Section 4(b).
                             51
<PAGE>

           (f)   Combined  Payments.   Anything in this Section  4  to  the
contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no obligation to pay you a
required  Gross-Up Payment under this Section 4 if the aggregate amount  of
all  Combined  Payments has at the time such payment is  due  exceeded  the
Limit.   If  the amount of a Gross-Up Payment to you under this  Section  4
would  result  in  the Combined Payments exceeding the Limit,  the  Company
shall  pay you only the portion, if any, of the Gross-Up Payment which  can
be  paid  to  you  without  causing the aggregate amount  of  all  Combined
Payments to exceed the Limit. In the event that you are entitled to a Gross-
Up  Payment under this Section 4 and other employees or former employees of
the  Company are also entitled to gross-up payments under the corresponding
provisions of the applicable Combined Arrangements and the aggregate amount
of  all  such  payments would cause the Limit on Combined  Payments  to  be
exceeded,  the Company shall allocate the amount of the reduction necessary
to comply with the Limit among all such payments in the proportion that the
amount  of each such gross-up payment bears to the aggregate amount of  all
such payments.  Nothing in this Section 4(f) shall require you to repay  to
the  Company any amount that was previously paid to you under this  Section
4.

          5.   Other Provisions.

           (a)   Vesting  and Exercise.  All Equity Awards granted  to  you
under  the Equity Plans (including Short-Term Awards) shall vest and become
exercisable  in the event of your Involuntary Termination on  or  following
the Change in Control Date.  If you are employed by the Company on the date
of  the  Equity  Plan Change in Control, your Equity Awards will  vest  and
become exercisable as of such date.

           (b)  Effect of 30-Day Alternative.  In accordance with the terms
of  the  Equity Plans, upon an Equity Plan Change in Control, Equity Awards
which are options or stock appreciation rights are "cashed out," unless the
Administrator in its discretion determines not to do so.  In the event that
the   Administrator  elects  not  to  cash  out  such  Equity  Awards,  the
Administrator has the discretion in the context of a merger or sale of  all
or  substantially all of the assets of the Company either (i) to cause such
Equity  Awards to be assumed or an equivalent option or stock  appreciation
right  granted by the successor corporation to the Company or a  parent  or
subsidiary  of  such successor corporation, or (ii) to  provide  that  your
Equity Awards will remain outstanding for a thirty-day period beginning  on
the  date that you are so notified of such action by the Administrator  and
that such Equity Awards will expire to the extent not exercised at the  end
of such thirty-day period (the "30-Day Alternative").  If the Administrator
determines  to  utilize the 30-Day Alternative, the Company shall  pay  you
with  respect to each such Equity Award the excess, if any (the "Additional
Amount"),  of the Change in Control Price you would have received  had  the
Equity  Award  been  cashed out on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control  over the value of the consideration actually received  by  you  in
settlement of such awards (determined as of the date such consideration  is
received by you).  Further, in the event of your Involuntary Termination on
or  after  the Change in Control Date but on or prior to the  date  of  the
Equity  Plan  Change in Control, the Company shall pay you  the  Additional
Amount  as if your employment had continued through the date of the  Equity
Plan  Change  in  Control.  In either case, the payment of  the  Additional
Amount  shall  be  made  within 5 days following the determination  by  the
Administrator of the Change in Control Price.

           (c)   Short-Term Awards.  In the event that (i) the  transaction
resulting in an Equity Plan Change in Control occurs at such a time  or  is
structured  in  such a manner so as to make it reasonably likely  that  you
would  be subject to actual or potential liability for short-swing  profits
under  Section  16 of the Exchange Act ("Short-Swing Profit Liability")  if
you  were to exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose (including through
a  merger)  of  your  Short-Term Awards as  part  of,  or  prior  to,  such
transaction and (ii) your inability to exercise, tender, sell or  otherwise
dispose  of  your Short-Term Awards on or prior to the date of such  Equity
Plan  Change in Control eliminates or reduces the value of some or  all  of
your  Short-Term  Awards, then, on the date of the Equity  Plan  Change  in
Control,  the  Company  shall pay you in a cash  lump  sum  the  amount  of
 .   The  provisions of clause (ii) of the previous sentence shall be deemed
to apply where (a) you are precluded from exercising,
                             52
<PAGE>

tendering or otherwise disposing of your Short-Term Awards on or  prior  to
the Transaction Date in order to avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability, (b)  a
Short-Term  Award  cannot be repurchased, exchanged or  cashed-out  by  the
Company  (or  other person) on or prior to the Transaction Date  without  a
risk  of  Short-Swing Profit Liability to you, or (c) you are  required  to
delay  the  exercise, sale, tender, or other disposition of your Short-Term
Awards  in  order  to  avoid Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  such  delay
results  in your receiving consideration for your Short-Term Awards (valued
at  the date such consideration is received) which is of lesser value  than
the  consideration you would have received (valued as of the  date  of  the
Equity Plan Change in Control) for such awards had such delay not occurred.
The  foregoing provisions shall apply to your Equity Awards notwithstanding
your Involuntary Termination of employment with the Company on or after the
Change in Control Date but prior to the Equity Plan Change in Control.  The
provisions of this Section 5(c) shall not apply if (A) prior to the  Equity
Plan  Change  in Control, the Company provides you at its expense  with  an
opinion  from  a nationally recognized firm of attorneys stating  that  the
exercise,  tender, sale or other disposition of your Short-Term  Awards  as
part  of, or prior to, the transaction resulting in the Equity Plan  Change
in  Control  will not subject you to Short-Swing Profit Liability  and  (B)
following your receipt of such opinion there is sufficient time for you  to
exercise, tender, sell or otherwise dispose of your Short-Term Awards on or
prior  to  the  Equity Plan Change in Control without impairing  the  value
thereof.

           (d)   General.   Anything  in  this Agreement  to  the  contrary
notwithstanding,   in  no  event  shall  the  vesting  and   exercisability
provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards be  less
favorable to you then the terms and provisions of such awards in effect  on
the date hereof.

          6.   Legal Fees and Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you  on  an after-tax basis for all costs and expenses (including,  without
limitation,  court  costs  and reasonable legal  fees  and  expenses  which
reflect  common practice with respect to the matters involved) incurred  by
you  as a result of any claim, action or proceeding (i) arising out of your
termination  of employment during the Term, (ii) contesting,  disputing  or
enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under this Agreement or  (iii)
arising  out of or challenging the validity, advisability or enforceability

amount  of  the payments and reimbursements under this Section 6 shall  not
exceed $2 million.

          7.   Successors; Binding Agreement.

           (a)   Assumption  by  Successor. The Company  will  require  any
successor  (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger,  consolidation
or  otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement  in  the
same  manner  and to the same extent that the Company would be required  to
perform  it if no such succession had taken place; provided, however,  that
no  such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.
As  used  in  this  Agreement, the "Company"  shall  mean  the  Company  as
hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business  and/or  assets  as
aforesaid  which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by  operation
of law or otherwise.

           (b)   Enforceability; Beneficiaries.  This  Agreement  shall  be
binding   upon  and  inure  to  the  benefit  of  you  (and  your  personal
representatives  and  heirs)  and the Company and  any  organization  which
succeeds  to  substantially all of the business or assets of  the  Company,
whether  by  means  of  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of   all   or
substantially  all  of  the assets of the Company or otherwise,  including,
without  limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by operation  of
law.   This  Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable  by
your   personal   or  legal  representatives,  executors,   administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you should  die
while  any  amount  would  still be payable to you  hereunder  if  you  had
continued  to  live,  all such amounts, unless otherwise  provided  herein,
shall  be  paid  in  accordance with the terms of this  Agreement  to  your
devisee,  legatee  or other designee or, if there is no such  designee,  to
your estate.

capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

           "Accounting Firm" shall mean Ernst & Young or, if such  firm  is
unable  or  unwilling  to perform such calculations,  such  other  national
accounting  firm as shall be designated by agreement between  you  and  the

           "Administrator" shall mean the "Administrator" as defined in the
applicable  Equity Plan or, if no such term is defined in the Equity  Plan,

           "Cause"  shall mean a termination of your employment during  the
Term  which  is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii)  your  willful
disclosure  of  material  trade  secrets  or  other  material  confidential

(iii)  your  willful and continued failure substantially  to  perform  your
duties  with the Company (other than any such failure resulting  from  your
incapacity  due  to  physical  or mental illness  or  any  such  actual  or
anticipated  failure resulting from a resignation by you for  Good  Reason)
after  a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you  by
the  Board,  which demand specifically identifies the manner in  which  the
Board  believes that you have not substantially performed your duties,  and
which  performance is not substantially corrected by you within 10 days  of
receipt of such demand.   For purposes of the previous sentence, no act  or
failure  to  act  on your part shall be deemed "willful"  unless  done,  or
omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable  belief
that  your  action  or omission was in the best interest  of  the  Company.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, you shall  not  be  deemed  to  have  been
terminated  for Cause unless and until there shall have been  delivered  to
you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less
than  three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of  the  Board  at  a
meeting  of  the  Board called and held for such purpose (after  reasonable
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be
heard  before  the Board), finding that in the good faith  opinion  of  the
Board  you  were guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i),  (ii)  or
(iii)  of the first sentence of this section and specifying the particulars
thereof in detail.

Item  6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange
Act,  whether  or  not  the  Company is  then  subject  to  such  reporting
requirement;  provided, however, that, anything in this  Agreement  to  the
contrary  notwithstanding, a Change in Control  shall  be  deemed  to  have
occurred if:

          (i)  any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust,  unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or  any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Exchange Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3  of  the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange  Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing  30%
     or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
     securities  entitled  to  vote in the election  of  directors  of  the
     Company;
     
           (ii)  during  any  period  of  two (2)  consecutive  years  (not

     individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the  Board
     and  any new directors, whose election by the Board or nomination  for
     election  by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote  of  at
     least three-fourths (3/4ths) of the directors then still in office who
     either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election
     or  nomination for election was previously so approved (the "Incumbent
     Directors"), cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof;
                             54

          (iii)     There occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or
     other  corporate  transaction involving the Company (a "Transaction"),
     in  each  case, with respect to which the stockholders of the  Company
     immediately  prior to such Transaction do not, immediately  after  the
     Transaction, own more than 50 percent of the combined voting power  of
     the Company or other corporation resulting from such Transaction;
     
           (iv)  all or substantially all of the assets of the Company  are
     sold, liquidated or distributed; or
     
           (v)   there  is a "change in control" of the Company within  the

result  in  a  Change  in Control and (iv) the date the  Company  fails  to
satisfy its obligations to have this agreement assumed by any successor  to
the  Company  in  accordance with Section 7(a) of this Agreement.   If  the
Change  in  Control  Date occurs as a result of an agreement  described  in
clause (ii) of the previous sentence or as a result of the approval of  the
Board described in clause (iii) of the previous sentence and the Change  in
Control  to  which  such agreement or approval relates  (the  "Contemplated
Change in Control") subsequently does not occur, then the Term shall expire
on  the  sixtieth  day  (the "Reset Date") following  the  date  the  Board
certifies  by  resolution  duly adopted by three-fourths  (3/4ths)  of  the
Incumbent Directors then in office that the Contemplated Change in  Control
is  not  reasonably likely to occur; provided, however, that this  sentence
shall  not apply if (A) an Involuntary Termination of your employment  with
the Company has occurred on and after the Change in Control Date and on  or
prior  to  the  Reset  Date  or  (B)  the Contemplated  Change  in  Control
subsequently  occurs within three months of the Reset Date.  Following  the
Reset  Date, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and  a
new  Term  shall  commence upon the occurrence of a  subsequent  Change  in
Control Date.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, if  your
employment with the Company terminates prior to the Change in Control  Date
and  it is reasonably demonstrated that your termination of employment  (i)
was  at  the  request  of  the third party who has taken  steps  reasonably
calculated  to  effect  the Change in Control or (ii)  otherwise  arose  in

Disability  upon which you and the Company cannot agree shall be determined
by a qualified independent physician selected by you (or, if you are unable
to make such selection, such selection shall be made by any adult member of
your immediate family), and approved by the Company.  The determination  of
such physician made in writing to the Company and to you shall be final and

     enforceable  against the Company in accordance with  their  respective
     terms.   The  execution and delivery by the Company of this  Agreement
     and  the  other  Closing  Agreements do  not  and  did  not,  and  the
     consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms of  the
     Closing Agreements will not, conflict with, result in any violation of
     or  default  (with or without notice or lapse of time or both)  under,
     give  rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration  of
     any  material obligation or to the loss of any material benefit  under

     on  the  Company's  ability  to perform  its  obligations  under  this
     Agreement  and the other Closing Agreements in accordance  with  their
     respective terms.  No Governmental Approval or Approval of  any  other

heretofore conducted.

     5.2  Restructuring Cooperation

          (a)   The  parties  will cause the Company  to  (i)  provide  the
     employees who are terminated in connection with the Restructuring with
     60  days  written  notice  of  termination  and  separation  benefits,

         (b) As part of the Restructuring, the Company management  and  IBM
     will be determining which Company employees will be required to remain
     with  the  Company  to  help the Company accomplish  its  new  mission
     (hereinafter "Core Team").  The Company will identify the "Core  Team"
     to Apple.  IBM and Apple may wish to hire other Company employees, not

     the  others  permission  or review for any hiring  decisions,  neither
     Apple nor IBM will interfere with the attempt by the Company to retain
     the Company employees designated as the Core Team.
     
     5.3  Establishment of Patent Licensing Company

          (a)   In  order  to  maximize the value of the  Company's  patent
     portfolio and to attempt to recover the cost of their advances to  the
     Company, the parties will establish a separate legal entity to  manage
     and  license the patent portfolio now held by the Company (the "Patent
     Venture").
     
          (b)   The  Patent Venture will be established prior to the  First
     Closing  and will initially be owned 100% by the Company.  The Company
     will  inventory all of the Existing Patents by January 26, 1996.   The
     Company will use its best efforts to cause all Existing Patents to  be
     memorialized  to  written invention disclosures by January  29,  1996.
     The  Company  will  assign ownership of the Existing  Patents  to  the
     Patent  Venture  on  or before January 29, 1996, subject  to  Existing
     Patent Licenses.
     
          (c)   The details of the management of the Patent Venture and the
     rights  and  obligations  of each party with respect  ot  such  Patent
     Venture will be as defined in the Patent Venture Agreement.
     
          (d)  Immediately following the First Closing, until the execution
     of the Patent Venture Agreement, the following provisions shall govern
     the Patent Venture:
     
                (i)  Apple and IBM will establish a management committee of
     equal  representation which will manage the Patent Venture,  determine
     licensing policy, and hire employees.  All significant decisions  will
     be  subject to unanimous consent by Apple and IBM.  Apple and IBM will
     make  an equal initial capital contribution (amount to be determined),
     will split equally the costs of formation, and will contribute equally
     on  a  quarterly  basis operating funds for the Patent  Venture.   The
     Patent  Venture will provide to each of Apple and IBM full  access  to
     all  information concerning its assets and financial  condition.   The
     Company will provide the Patent Venture full access and cooperation in
     ensuring  the  perfection  of  the broadest  possible  rights  in  the
     portfolio.
     
                (ii)  Unless  otherwise  agreed, the  Patent  Venture  will
     terminate,  and the assets distributed to and liabilities  assumed  by
     Apple and IBM (or their designees) as follows:
     
                             84
<PAGE>
          
          
                (A)  On  or  before September 2, 1996, the  Patent  Venture
     will  provide  to  each of Apple and IBM a schedule  of  the  Existing
     Patents.   Such  schedule  will enumerate each  such  Existing  Patent
     separately, provided that rights to "counterparts" shall be considered
     to be part of the related domestic Existing Patent.  In the event that
     two  or  more  U.S. Patents or patent applications have been  combined
     into  a  single patent application outside the U.S., such U.S. Patents
     and/or  patent  applications shall be considered as a single  Existing
     Patent for the purposes of this schedule.
     
                    (B) On September 16, 1996, Apple and IBM will divide up
     the  portfolio  by means of alternate picks: one party will  have  the
     opportunity to select a single Existing Patent to be assigned  to  it;
     followed by the other party selecting another single Existing  Patent;
     and continuing in turn until each Existing Patent in the portfolio has
     been  selected  by one or the other party.  The determination  of  who
     will select the first Existing Patent will be made by a toss of coin.
     
                     (C)   Upon completion of the selection process,  Apple
     and  IBM  shall  cooperate to initiate a bid  process  to  obtain  the
     highest  possible third party bid for the entire patent  portfolio  of
     the  Venture.   This process shall be completed and  the  highest  bid
     obtained on or before January 16, 1997.
     
                     (D)  Within ten (10) days of the completion of the bid
     process  and  no later than January 26, 1997, each of  Apple  and  IBM
     shall  simultaneously  declare to the other  in  writing  whether  the
     highest  bid  is  acceptable to it or not acceptable to  it  with  the
     following results:
     
                         (1)  If both Apple and IBM agree, then the highest
     bid  will  be  accepted and the entire portfolio  transferred  by  the
     Patent Venture to the highest bidder subject to all existing licenses.
     Licenses   granted  to third parties during the  term  of  the  Patent
     Venture  ("Venture Licenses") will be assigned to and future  proceeds
     therefrom will benefit the highest bidder.
     
                          (2)   If  both Apple and IBM disagree,  then  the
     Patent  Venture  will  assign  to each of  Apple  and  IBM  (or  their
     respective  designees)  the  Patents  so  selected,  subject  to   any
     liabilities in the form of licenses set forth in Section  5.3(b)   and
     the Venture Licenses.  Each Venture License will be assigned to one or
     the other of Apple and IBM as appropriate, or to both, but in any case
     the  future  proceeds from each such Venture License will  be  equally
     split between the Apple and IBM.
     
                             85
<PAGE>
          
          
                      (3)    If  one  of  Apple  or  IBM  agrees  and   one
     disagrees, then the portfolio shall be transferred as set forth in (2)
     above,  provided  however that the disagreeing party  shall  have  the
     option  within  ten (10) days from the receipt of the  other  parties'
     declaration  to inform the other party that it will pay to  the  other
     party one-half of the highest bid and in this event the Patent Venture
     will transfer the entire patent portfolio to the disagreeing party  or
     its designee as set forth in (1) above.
     
                     (E)  The other assets of the Patent Venture which  are
     not  Existing  Patent or Venture Licenses will be liquidated  and  the
     proceeds distributed equally net of the payment of remaining debts  or
     obligations.   Notwithstanding the provisions of  Section  (D)  above,
     upon  request of either Apple or IBM, Apple and IBM agree to  continue
     the Patent Venture as a legal entity to manage the separate portfolios
     for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 6 months) necessary for
     an  orderly  assignment  of  Existing Patent  assets  to  third  party
     designees of the parties.
     
     5.4  Obligations Suspended under Research Agreement, etc.

     Unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section  6.1
without the Second Closing having occurred:

          (a)   Apple  and IBM agree to suspend each obligation  under  the
     Research  Agreement  or  Apple License  Out  which  would  not  be  an
     obligation  under  the  New Research Agreement  or  New  License  Out,
     including without limitation any funding amounts required to  be  paid
     by  Apple  under the Research Agreement but not required  to  be  paid
     under the New Research Agreement.
     
          (b)   Apple  and  IBM agree that neither party  will  invoke  any
     default  or similar mechanism under the Stockholder Agreement  or  the
     Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws.
     
     5.5  Further Actions

     IBM shall not cause or permit the Company to become a Subsidiary of IBM
prior to the First Closing Date.  Apple shall not cause or permit  any Lien
to  be  created with respect to the Apple Shares prior to the  Second Closing
Date (other than any created as a result of the execution of  this Agreement).
In  addition, each party shall take all actions  commercially reasonable  or
appropriate to ensure that the conditions  to  Closing  set forth  herein to
be satisfied by such party are satisfied on  or  prior  to each  Closing Date
and to obtain (and cooperate with the other  parties  in obtaining) any
                             86

Governmental Approvals required to be obtained or made by it in  connection
with  any  of  the  Transactions.  The Company shall afford  to  the  other
parties  and their representatives access to properties, books and records,

such  other  party  to  perform adequately its due diligence  and  business
reviews relating to the Company.

     or indirect Subsidiary, provided that no such assignment shall relieve
     such  party  of  any obligations hereunder; or (ii) an  assignment  by
     operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of  such
     party.
     
          (b)   Any attempted assignment of this Agreement in violation  of
     this Section shall be void and of no effect.
     
          (c)   This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the  benefit
     of  and  be  enforceable by the parties hereto  and  their  respective
     successors and permitted assigns.
     
     6.10.     No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

     This  Agreement  is  for  the sole benefit of the  parties  and  their
permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or  be
construed  to give to any Person, other than the parties and such  assigns,
any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

     6.11.     Remedies.

          (a)   In  no event will any party be liable to another party  for
     incidental  or special damages regardless of the form of action,  lost
     profits, lost savings or any other consequential damages, even if such
     party  has  been advised of the possibility of such damages, resulting
     from the breach of its obligations under any Closing Agreement or from
     the  use  of  any confidential or other information or  any  items  or
     products supplied pursuant to the Closing Agreements.
     
          (b)   Because the breach by any party of the provisions  of  this
     Agreement  would  cause irreparable harm and significant  injury  that
     would  be  difficult  to  ascertain and would not  be  compensable  by
     damages  alone, the parties agree that each party will have the  right
     to  enforce  such  provisions by Injunction, specific  performance  or
     other  equitable  relief without prejudice to  any  other  rights  and
     remedies  the  enforcing party may have.  The  reference  to  specific
     Sections in this Section is not a waiver of any party's rights to seek
     equitable relief for breaches of other Sections.
     
     6.12.  Expenses.

          (a)   Whether or not any of the Transactions are consummated, all
     costs  and expenses incurred in connection with the Closing Agreements
     and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or
     expense, except as the parties shall otherwise agree.
     
          (b)  The provisions of this Section shall remain operative and in
     full  force and effect regardless of the expiration of this  Agreement
     or the consummation of the Transactions.
     
     6.13      Construction.

     This Agreement has been negotiated by the parties and their respective
counsel  and  will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its  terms  and
without any strict construction in favor of or against any party.

Exhibit 10.B.14
                    stock purchase agreement


      THIS  STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is dated as of April
4,  1996 (the "Effective Date"), and is made by and between APPLE COMPUTER,
INC.,  a  California corporation (hereinafter "Apple"),  and  SCI  SYSTEMS,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("SCI").


                            Recitals


      A.    Apple  is  engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing,
marketing,  distributing and selling personal computers and  other  related
electronic products.

      B.    Apple  desires to sell, and SCI desires to purchase,  upon  the
terms  and  subject  to the conditions set fort by the  appropriate  person
outstanding shares of capital stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary  of  Apple
("NEWCO"), a corporation which will be formed on or before the Closing Date
to  hold certain assets used by Apple in the operation of its manufacturing
facility in Fountain, Colorado (the "Fountain Facility").

      C.    Apple  and  SCI mutually desire that, after the Closing,  NEWCO
shall operate the Fountain Facility, and shall, inter alia, manufacture and
assemble certain Apple Products at the Fountain Facility, pursuant  to  the
terms and conditions set forth in the Manufacturing Agreement and the other
Related  Agreements to be executed and entered into by the  parties  at  or
prior to the Closing.

      NOW,  THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and of  the
mutual  covenants and agreements herein contained, and for other  good  and
valuable  consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of  which  are  hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties  hereto
agree as follows:

1.   SALE AND TRANSFER OF SHARES; CLOSING

1.1  Shares.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing,  Apple  will  sell, transfer and deliver all  of  the  outstanding
shares  of the capital stock of NEWCO (the "Shares") to SCI, and  SCI  will
purchase the Shares from Apple for the Purchase Price set forth in  Section
1.2.

1.2   Purchase  Price.  The purchase price (the "Purchase Price")  for  the
Shares  will  be  equal to the total capitalization  of  NEWCO  as  of  the
Closing.  Such amount shall be the sum of:  (i) an amount equal to the  net
book  value of the Real Property and the Personal Property (other than  the
Spare  Parts)  as  of  the  Closing Date,  calculated  in  accordance  with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (as  shown on NEWCO's books
                               93
<PAGE>



and records); (ii) an amount  equal  to Apple's  original  purchase cost of 
the Spare  Parts  (for purposes  of  this Agreement,  the  parties estimate 
that the portion of  the  total  Purchase Price  allocated to such Spare 
Parts shall be Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000),  but the final 
amount with respect thereto shall be  determined by  the  parties prior to 
the expiration of the Due Diligence Period);  and (iii)  One  Hundred Sixty 
Million Dollars ($160,000,000).  At the  Closing, the  parties shall execute 
an amendment to this Agreement setting forth the final  amount of the total 
Purchase Price.  The entire Purchase Price shall be paid, in cash or other 
immediately available funds, at the Closing.

1.3   Closing.  Consummation of the Transaction (the "Closing") shall  take
place at the offices of the Person mutually agreed upon by SCI and Apple to
act  as  the  escrow agent for the Closing (the "Escrow Agent"),  at  10:00
o'clock  A.M. (local Colorado time) on May 31, 1996, or on such other  date
as  the parties hereto agree.  The date on which the Closing shall occur is
referred  to  herein  as the "Closing Date".  All deliveries  provided  for
herein  from  one  party to the other shall be made to  the  Escrow  Agent,
unless both parties expressly agree otherwise, in writing.

reasonably necessary to vest in NEWCO good, valid and marketable  title  to

the  terms  and  conditions  hereof, at the  Closing,  Apple  will  assign,
transfer,  convey  and deliver to NEWCO, all of Apple's  right,  title  and
interest in the following:
                               95
<PAGE>



      A.   The real property commonly known as 702 Bandley Drive, Fountain,
Colorado,  as  more  particularly described in Exhibit A  attached  hereto,
together with all improvements on the real property (collectively the "Real
Property"  or  the  "Site"), and all appurtenant rights thereto,  including
without  limitation easements, rights of way, licenses and other  interests
therein; and

      B.    All  personal property (including manufacturing  and  operating
equipment,  and  certain spare parts relating thereto [the "Spare  Parts"])
owned by Apple and used by Apple in its operation of the Fountain Facility,
to  the extent set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto, including machinery,
equipment, computers, tools, vehicles, furniture, all relevant data, files,
books and records at the Fountain Facility regarding the Assets, and office
supplies  and  office  equipment (collectively, the  "Personal  Property").
During  the  Due  Diligence  Period, SCI  and  Apple  shall  identify  with
specificity  those  Spare Parts currently located at the Fountain  Facility
which shall be transferred to NEWCO pursuant to this Agreement, and Exhibit
B  shall be amended, at or prior to the Closing, to accurately reflect such
items; and

      C.   Certain inventories of materials and components currently at the
Site and owned by Apple, and used in connection with Apple's ownership  and
operation of the Assets, which inventory shall be identified by the parties
prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, and shall be set forth
in Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Initial Inventory").

      D.    The  Real Property, the Personal Property (including the  Spare
Parts)  and  the  Initial Inventory are sometimes referred to  collectively
herein as the "Assets".

      E.    As  part of the Transaction, Apple shall assign to  NEWCO,  and
NEWCO  shall  assume,  all authorizations, consents,  approvals,  licenses,

or  governmental or administrative authority which relate solely to Apple's
ownership and operation of the Assets, to the extent such Assigned  Permits
are assignable or transferable, and to the extent not encompassed within or
addressed  by  any of the Related Agreements, all as more particularly  set
forth in Exhibit D attached hereto (collectively, the "Assigned Permits").

      F.    As  part of the Transaction, Apple shall assign to  NEWCO,  and
NEWCO  shall  assume,  certain agreements and  contracts  relating  to  the
operation  of  the Site, including leases to which Apple  is  a  party  and

hereto, and which SCI shall agree, by written notice to Apple prior to  the
Due  Diligence  Completion  Date, to have NEWCO assume  (collectively,  the
"Assigned Contracts").  To the extent any consents or approvals by,  of  or
from  the  other  parties  to said Assigned Contracts  are  necessary  with
respect  to  such  assignment and assumption, Apple shall use  commercially
reasonable efforts to secure such consents or approvals.  If such  consents
or  approvals  are not secured by the Closing Date, SCI may elect  to  have
NEWCO  assume any contract for which the required third party  consent  has

and  in  any case SCI shall advise Apple, in writing, of its election  with
respect to any such contract not later than the Closing.

arising on and after the Closing under the Assigned Contracts, and (ii) all
of  Apple's obligations arising on and after the Closing under the Assigned

to NEWCO.

2.3   Sale  of  Assets  "AS IS".  Except as expressly  set  forth  in  this
Agreement, Apple shall transfer the Assets to NEWCO in their "AS IS,  WHERE

inspection  and  examination  of the Assets  prior  to  the  Closing  Date.
Neither  Apple,  nor any of Apple's agents, representatives  or  employees,
have  made any representations or warranties, direct or implied, verbal  or
written,  with  respect  to the Assets, or their  merchantability,  or  the
fitness  thereof for any particular purpose, except as expressly set  forth
in  this  Agreement  and  the instruments of conveyance  delivered  at  the

damaged  by  flood, fire, earthquake or other casualty, or any governmental
or  quasi-governmental entity commences any legal action or eminent  domain
proceeding to take any portion of the Assets, then Apple shall give  prompt
notice  thereof  to  SCI  and SCI shall have the right  to  terminate  this
Agreement  by  written  notice to Apple within five (5)  days  after  SCI's
receipt  or  deemed receipt of such notice, in which event  this  Agreement
shall  immediately  terminate  and the parties  shall  thereafter  have  no
further  rights or obligations hereunder; provided, however,  that  if  SCI
elects  to go forward with the Transaction, all casualty insurance proceeds
relating solely to said casualty or loss with respect to any such damage to
any  of  the  Assets, and/or all the proceeds of any such taking  shall  be
assigned  to  NEWCO at the Closing, to the extent that such proceeds  would
otherwise be payable to Apple.

2.5   Excluded Assets.; The Assets which are the subject of this  Agreement
shall  not  include the assets and/or property of Apple described  in  this
Section 2.5, none of which shall be transferred to NEWCO (collectively, the

the  Site in connection with the design, development or manufacture of  the
Apple  Products  manufactured at the Site, or used in connection  with  the
activities  described  in and contemplated by the Manufacturing  Agreement.
To  the extent that any such information and intellectual property is  part
of  the Transaction, it shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Intellectual Property Agreement.

      D.    Cash, cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, bank accounts,
prepaid items, accounts or notes receivable, and unbilled accounts or notes
arising from work completed at the Site on or prior to the Closing Date.

obligations which are not assumed by NEWCO hereunder.

2.6  Excluded Liabilities.

Section  2,  NEWCO  shall  not  assume,  perform,  pay  or  discharge   any
liabilities,  obligations, payables or debts of  Apple,  whether  known  or
unknown,  accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and  Apple  shall  be
solely responsible for the payment or discharge thereof.

      B.    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, SCI
and NEWCO shall not assume any liabilities or obligations of Apple:

           (iii)      for  any employee-related liability or obligation  of

<PAGE>



           (iv)  for obligations or transactions of any kind between  Apple
and its shareholders, subsidiaries or affiliates; or

          (v)  for any accounts payable of Apple arising in connection with

except  as expressly provided in the Manufacturing Agreement or any of  the
other Related Agreements.

2.7  Prorations; Tax Elections.

between  Apple, on the one hand, and NEWCO, on the other hand,  as  of  the

the  Assigned  Contracts;  (iii) charges for  utilities  serving  the  Real
Property;  (iv)  deposits with respect to the Assets; (v) interest  charges

the  Assets;  (vii)  fees  under any of the Assigned  Permits;  and  (viii)
governmental assessments and charges for services to or with respect to any

appropriately decreased by the pro rata amount of any such items which  are
accrued  but  unpaid  as  of the Closing Date, and shall  be  appropriately
increased by the pro rata amount of any such items which have been  prepaid
by Apple as of the Closing Date.

      B.    338(h)(10) Election.  Apple and SCI will make an election under
Section  338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended  (the
"Code")  (and any corresponding elections under applicable state, local  or
foreign tax law) (collectively, the "338(h)(10) Election") with respect  to
the  purchase  and sale of the Shares under this Agreement.  In  connection
with  any such election, Apple and SCI will jointly execute IRS Form 8023-A
(Corporate  Qualified Stock Purchases) at the Closing.   The  parties  will
timely  file the Form 8023-A with the appropriate Internal Revenue  Service
("IRS")  Center, via certified mail, return receipt requested to  establish
proof of filing of the form with the IRS.  Apple and SCI also agree to file
any other forms or to take such other steps as may be necessary to properly

loss incurred by Apple with regard to the making of the 338(h)(10) Election

election,  the  Purchase Price shall be allocated by  mutual  agreement  of
Apple  and SCI, as set forth in Exhibit F attached hereto.  Apple  and  SCI
will  file  all tax returns (including amended returns and any  claims  for
refund)   and  information  reports  in  a  manner  consistent  with   such

2.8  No Breach By Reason of Sale.;  It is the intention of the parties that
this  Agreement shall not constitute an assignment or attempted  assignment
of  any lease, license, commitment or other contract or agreement to  which
either  SCI  or  Apple  is  a party, if any such  assignment  or  attempted
assignment  would  constitute  a  breach or  violation  thereof;  it  being
understood,  however, that the preceding does not relieve  Apple  from  any
liability to NEWCO or to SCI which Apple would otherwise have hereunder  by
reason  of  a  breach of Apple's representations, warranties, covenants  or
conditions  resulting  from the failure of Apple to  transfer  such  lease,
license, commitment, or other contract or agreement to NEWCO.

2.9   Waiver of Bulk Sales Law Compliance.;  Compliance with the bulk sales
laws  of the State of Colorado, if any, and those of any other jurisdiction
which  may be applicable to the Transaction, is hereby waived by  SCI,  and
Apple  hereby  agrees to defend, indemnify and hold NEWCO and SCI  harmless
from  and  against any claims by any Person arising out of or  due  to  the
failure  to  comply with such bulk sales laws, including without limitation
any claims by any Person against all or any part of the Assets.

2.10  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Filing.;  Promptly  following  execution  of  this
Agreement by the parties, SCI and Apple shall prepare such documentation as
may  be  necessary  to make any required filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino

limitation providing relevant data to the other as needed to complete  said
filing.  SCI shall pay all required fees with respect to such filing.

and will effectively convey to and vest in SCI good and marketable title to
the Shares.

3.3   No Violation.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by  Apple
and  the performance of this Agreement by Apple will not (i) conflict  with
or  violate the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Apple, (ii)  subject
to the obtaining of all required consents from governmental entities having
jurisdiction  or  other  third  parties, as  provided  in  this  Agreement,

third  party under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any  lien  or
encumbrance  on any of the Assets or the Shares pursuant to,  any  material
note,  bond,  mortgage,  indenture, contract,  agreement,  lease,  license,
permit,  franchise or other instrument or obligation to which  Apple  is  a
party  or  by  which Apple is bound or affected, except,  with  respect  to
clauses  (ii)  and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations,  defaults  or
other occurrences that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Apple.

3.4   Consents.   Except for governmental consents required under  the  HSR
Act, which will be requested as provided in Section 2.10 of this Agreement,
and  as  may  be  required under the Assigned Contracts  and  the  Assigned
Permits, no consent of any Person (other than those previously obtained) is
necessary  to  the  consummation  of the  Transaction,  including,  without
limitation,  consents  from parties to loans, contracts,  leases  or  other

3.5  Title to Assets; Encumbrances.

      A.   Apple has good and marketable title to the Personal Property and
the  Initial Inventory, and good, marketable fee simple title to  the  Real
Property,  subject only to the Permitted Liens.  The Assets  are  free  and
clear  of  all liens (including liens for Taxes as defined below),  claims,
charges,  security interests or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
including, without limitation, leases, chattel mortgages, conditional sales
contracts,  collateral security arrangements and other  title  or  interest

the  Real Property,  (iv) rights reserved to any governmental authority  to
regulate any of the Assets, and (v) inchoate materialmen's, mechanic's and 
workmen's liens or other like liens arising in the ordinary course of business;
none of  which  materially  detract from the value or  impair  the  use  of
the property  subject  thereto  as currently used,  or  materially  impair  
the current operations of the Site.

      B.   With respect to the Real Property, Apple warrants and represents
as follows:

          (i)  No options have been granted to others to purchase, lease or
otherwise  acquire any interest in the Real Property, or any part  thereof.
Apple  has  the exclusive right of possession of each tract comprising  the
Real  Property,  subject  only to matters of record  (including  easements,
rights of way and other similar matters of record).

           (ii)  Neither Apple nor any other Person has caused any work  or
improvements  to be performed upon or made to the Real Property  for  which
there  remains outstanding any payment obligation that would or might serve
as  the  basis for any claim, lien, charge or encumbrance in favor  of  the
Person which performed the work, other than Permitted Liens.

           (iii)      All  requisite certificates of  occupancy  and  other
permits  or approvals required with respect to the improvements on  any  of
the  Real Property and the occupancy and use thereof have been obtained and
are currently in effect.

            (iv)  Except  as  disclosed  to  SCI,  Apple  has  received  no
notification  that  it is in violation of any applicable building,  zoning,
anti-pollution, health or other law, ordinance or regulation in respect  of
the  Assets or in respect of Apple's operations at the Site, and  no  facts
have  come  to  the  attention of Apple to cause it  to  believe  any  such
violation exists.

           (v)   Neither the whole nor any portion of the Real Property  is
subject  to  any  governmental decree or order  to  be  sold  or  is  being
condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any public authority with  or
without payment of compensation therefor, nor to Apple's best knowledge has
any such condemnation, expropriation or taking been proposed.

3.6   Condition  of Assets.  The Personal Property has no material  defects
and  is  in  good  operating condition and repair,  normal  wear  and  tear
excepted, and is adequate for the uses to which it is being put;  and  that
portion of the Personal Property identified in Exhibit B as equipment  used
in  the  manufacture  and  assembly of Apple Products  has  been  regularly
maintained in the ordinary course of business.

3.7   Assigned  Permits.   To the best of Apple's knowledge,  the  Assigned
Permits constitute all permits needed to operate the Assets at the Fountain
Facility.
                               102

3.8  Taxes.

      A.   "Taxes" shall mean all taxes, charges, fees, levies, imposts  or
other  assessments, including, without limitation, income, gross  receipts,
excise,  use, transfer, property, sales, license, payroll, withholding  and
franchise  taxes,  imposed by the United States, or  any  state,  local  or
foreign government or subdivision or agency thereof, whether computed on  a
unitary,  combined or any other basis, and also including any interest  and
penalties or additions to tax.

      B.    As of the date hereof, there are no Liens with respect to Taxes
(other  than  Permitted Liens for Taxes not yet delinquent)  in  connection
with the Assets.  Apple has reserved for or paid, withheld, collected,  and
paid  over  to  the  proper governmental authorities all  Taxes  which  are
required  to  be  paid, withheld, collected, or paid to and  including  the
Closing  Date  with respect to the Assets and its operations  at  the  Site
(other  than  Taxes which are being contested by Apple in good faith),  and
Apple  shall  pay  all Taxes due and payable to and including  the  Closing
Date,  to the extent that such amounts are not prorated at the Closing  and
the payment obligation therefor would thereafter rest with NEWCO.

      C.    For  all  periods  to and including the Closing  (whether  such
periods  are  reflected  in a return or report  ending  on  or  before  the
Closing, or after the Closing), NEWCO has timely filed or will have  filed,
all  Federal,  foreign, state, county, local and/or other taxing  authority
tax  returns, reports, or other required filings with respect to any Taxes,
and  has  paid or will pay such Taxes with respect to such returns, reports
or required filings for all such periods as such Taxes become due.

      D.    Apple  agrees that it shall indemnify and hold  SCI  and  NEWCO
harmless  of  and from any loss, liability or expense actually incurred  by
SCI or NEWCO as a result of all tax liability for which NEWCO may be liable
as  a member of an affiliated, consolidated, unitary or combined group  (as
defined  in  Section  1502 of the Code, or any comparable  state  or  local
statute, rule or regulation) which includes Apple or any Apple Affiliates.

3.9   Contracts.  The list of contracts and agreements set forth in Exhibit
E  attached  hereto is a true, complete and correct list of all agreements,
contracts  and commitments necessary to operate the Assets, and to  Apple's
best  knowledge there are no material defaults by any party thereunder  nor
have  any amendments, oral or written, to any such Assigned Contracts  been
made or entered into by Apple except as set forth in said Exhibit E.

3.10 Assumed Liabilities.  Apple has disclosed to SCI all known liabilities
of  Apple  under  and pursuant to the Assigned Contracts and  the  Assigned
Permits, and with respect to the Assets.

3.11  Litigation.  There are no actions, suits, inquiries,  proceedings  or
investigations  by or before any court or governmental or other  regulatory
or   administrative  agency  or  commission  (collectively,  "Proceedings")
pending  or,  to  Apple's best knowledge, threatened against  or  involving
Apple  (other  than solely as plaintiff initiated by Apple in the  ordinary
course  of  collecting receivables) relating to the Assets.   There  is  no
Proceeding known to Apple to be pending or threatened which questions or
                               103
<PAGE>



challenges  the  validity of this Agreement or any action taken  or  to  be
taken  by  Apple  pursuant  to this Agreement or  in  connection  with  the
Transaction; nor to Apple's best knowledge is there any valid basis for any
such Proceeding with respect to Apple.  Apple is not in default under or in
violation  of, nor to Apple's best knowledge is there any valid  basis  for
any  claim of default under or violation of, any of the Assigned Contracts,
which  default or violation would have a Material Adverse Effect on NEWCO's
ownership and operation of the Assets, or on SCI's ownership of NEWCO.

3.12  Compliance with Law.  Except for insubstantial violations which would
have  no Material Adverse Effect, Apple's operations at the Site have  been
conducted  in  accordance with all applicable laws, regulations  and  other
requirements of all national governmental authorities, and of  all  states,
municipalities  and  other  political  subdivisions  and  agencies   having
jurisdiction  over  Apple's  operations at  the  Site,  including,  without
limitation,  all  such  laws,  regulations  and  requirements  relating  to
antitrust,  consumer  protection,  currency  exchange,  equal  opportunity,
health,  occupational  safety,  pension, and  securities.   Apple  has  not
received any notification of any asserted present or past failure by  Apple
to comply with such laws, rules or regulations.

ownership  and  operation  of  the Fountain Facility,  Apple  has  had  all
permits, licenses and other authorizations which are required in connection
with  its  operations  at  the  Fountain Facility  under  and  pursuant  to
applicable  Federal,  state  and  local laws,  rules,  regulations,  codes,
orders,  decrees,  judgments  or  injunctions  relating  to  pollution   or
protection  of the environment, including without limitation laws  relating
to torts and laws relating to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened
releases  of  pollutants, contaminants, chemicals or any other  industrial,
hazardous   or   toxic  substances,  materials  or  wastes   (collectively,
"Hazardous Materials") into the environment (including, without limitation,
ambient  air, surface water, ground water, or land), or otherwise  relating
to  the  manufacture,  processing, distribution, use,  treatment,  storage,
disposal,  transport,  handling  of, or exposure  to,  Hazardous  Materials
(collectively, "Environmental Laws") at the Fountain Facility.   Except  as
may  have been disclosed to SCI in any documentation delivered by Apple  to
SCI  prior  to  the  Effective Date, Apple is,  and  has  been  during  its
operations  at  the  Fountain Facility, in compliance with  all  terms  and
conditions of such required permits, licenses and authorizations,  and,  to
the  best of Apple's knowledge, nothing has occurred while Apple has  owned
the  Fountain Facility which would cause Apple to fail to be in  compliance
with said Environmental Laws with respect to its operations at the Fountain
Facility.   Except  as may have been disclosed to SCI in any  documentation
delivered  by Apple to SCI prior to the Effective Date, Apple is not  aware
of,  nor  has Apple received notice of, any past, present or future events,
conditions,  circumstances, activities, practices,  incidents,  actions  or
plans  which may interfere with or prevent continued compliance  with  said
Environmental  Laws,  or which may give rise to any  common  law  or  legal
liability,  or  may otherwise form the basis of any claim, action,  demand,
suit,  proceeding  or hearing, based on or related to Apple's  manufacture,
processing,  distribution,  use, treatment, storage,  disposal,  transport,
handling,  exposure to, emission, discharge, release or threatened  release
into the environment, of any Hazardous Materials at the
                               104
<PAGE>



Fountain  Facility.  There is no civil, criminal or administrative  action,
suit, demand, claim, hearing, notice or demand letter, notice of violation,
investigation,  or  proceeding  pending  or,  to  Apple's  best  knowledge,
threatened,  against Apple relating in any way to said  Environmental  Laws
with respect to Apple's use and operation of the Fountain Facility.

3.14  Occupational  Safety and Health.  Except as set forth  in  Exhibit  I
attached  hereto,  to  Apple's best knowledge, Apple is,  in  all  material
respects,   in   compliance  with  all  standards,  duties,   requirements,
responsibilities,  rules, regulations and orders (hereinafter  "safety  and
health obligations") currently promulgated under, or issued pursuant to  or
in  enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,  or  any
laws, plans, or safety and health obligations currently established by  any
state  or  political  subdivision thereof or by common law,  applicable  to
Apple's  operations  at the Site, with respect to occupational  safety  and
health.  Except as set forth in said Exhibit I, Apple is not aware of,  nor
has  Apple  received  notice  of,  any  past,  present  or  future  events,
conditions,  circumstances, activities, practices,  incidents,  actions  or
plans  relating to its operations at the Site which prevent  compliance  or
continued  compliance with the aforesaid laws, plans or safety  and  health
obligations  as  they  exist on the date hereof  or  any  orders,  decrees,
judgments, or injunctions, which have been issued, entered, promulgated  or
approved  thereunder, or which may give rise to any  common  law  or  legal
liability, or otherwise form the basis of any claim, action, demand,  suit,
proceeding  or hearing, based on Apple's violation of any of the  aforesaid
laws, plans, or safety and health obligations to employees or others and on
its duty to maintain a workplace free of safety and health hazards.  Except
as   set  forth  in  said  Exhibit  I,  there  is  no  civil,  criminal  or
administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, citation, employee  or
other  complaint, notice of violation, investigation, or proceeding pending
or  to Apple's best knowledge threatened against Apple relating in any  way
to  the aforesaid laws, plans, or safety and health obligations established
by the Federal government or any state or political subdivision thereof, or
by  common  law,  or any orders, decrees, judgments or injunctions  issued,
entered,  promulgated  or  approved  thereunder  with  respect  to  Apple's
operations at the Site.

thereunder,  and to otherwise perform investigations, historical  analyses,
and  make  inquiries  relative to the presence  or  potential  presence  of
Hazardous Materials on the Real Property, and shall have the right to drill
holes,  dig wells, and perform borings, provided that such entry  onto  the
Real  Property shall comply with the terms and provisions of Section 5.1.A,
above, and further provided that:

discretion,  all engineers, consultants, companies, laboratories,  drillers
and  other  persons  proposed by SCI to perform any of the  Due  Diligence,
prior  to  their  entry onto the Site, and SCI shall  not  allow  any  such
persons  onto  the  Site  prior  to advising  Apple  and  giving  Apple  an
opportunity  to approve all such persons, with such approval  being  deemed
given  if  Apple does not advise SCI, within three (3) business days  after
being advised of SCI's selection of any third party, of Apple's disapproval
of the designated third party;

           (ii)  SCI  shall  obtain  Apple's prior written  consent  (which
consent  shall  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)  to  the  sampling
plan,  testing  methods  and other material elements  of  the  sampling  or
testing proposed by SCI;

          (iii)     SCI shall, at its sole expense, seal and cap any holes,
wells,  or  other  borings made by it, and shall restore the  Site  to  its
condition existing prior to any such sampling or testing by SCI;

           (iv)  SCI shall conduct all sampling or testing, and all closure
work  with  respect  to such sampling or testing, in  accordance  with  all
Federal,  state and local rules, regulations, laws and statutes  applicable
thereto;

          (v)  SCI shall bear all costs of any sampling or testing, and any
closure work in connection therewith; and

           (vi)  SCI shall hold and maintain all reports, results and other
information  concerning any testing or sampling, and  the  Assets,  in  the
strictest confidence, and shall promptly deliver true, complete and correct

     THE CLOSING.

Between  the  signing  of this Agreement and the Closing  Date,  except  as
otherwise  consented  to  by SCI in writing in  advance,  Apple  agrees  as
follows.

7.1   Business in Ordinary Course.  Apple's business at the Site  shall  be
conducted  only  in  the  ordinary course,  consistent  with  Apple's  past
practice,  which  shall  not include the making  of  any  commitment  which
extends  beyond  ninety (90) days from the date hereof, the acquisition  of
capital  assets  in  excess  of Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($50,000)  in  the
aggregate,  or the removal of any Assets other than in the ordinary  course
of  business.   Subject to the dollar limitations set forth above  in  this
Section 7.1, and provided that Apple shall not be obligated or required  to
expend  more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) in repairing or  replacing
any  of  the  Assets,  Apple will use commercially  reasonable  efforts  to

order  as  at  the  Effective Date hereof, except for depreciation  through
ordinary wear and tear.
                               112
<PAGE>



7.2   Sale  or  Pledge of Assets.  Subject to Apple's rights under  Section
7.1,  above, Apple shall not sell or lease any of the Assets or  incur  and
allow  to  continue to exist at the Closing Date any Liens on  any  of  the
Assets,  except  for  Permitted  Liens, and  those  Liens  which  arise  by
operation of law, or are incurred in the ordinary course in accordance with
Section 7.1, or would not cause the representations contained in Section 3,
above, to be untrue were such Liens to exist on the Closing Date.

7.3   Changes  in  Agreements.  Apple shall not  amend  or  modify  in  any
material  respect,  or  consent to the early termination  of,  any  of  the
Assigned Contracts.

7.4   Preservation  of Business Organization.  Consistent  with  the  other
provisions  of  this  Agreement, Apple shall  use  commercially  reasonable
efforts  to  preserve  the Assets and the business of  Apple  at  the  Site
intact,  and to keep available to SCI and/or to NEWCO, as the case may  be,
the  services  of Apple's present employees consistent with past  practice,
and  to  preserve the goodwill of Apple's suppliers and others with respect
to the Assigned Contracts.

7.5   Insurance.  Apple shall keep all insurance currently  in  place  with
respect  to  the  Assets in full force and effect.  All premiums  due  from
Apple  with  respect to such insurance have been paid, and  Apple  has  not
received any notice of cancellation with respect thereto.

7.6  Compliance with Laws.  Apple shall comply with all laws applicable  to
its  ownership  and  operation  of  the Assets,  except  for  insubstantial
violations which would have no Material Adverse Effect.

8.   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES;
     INDEMNIFICATION.

8.1    Survival   of   Representations  and  Warranties.    Each   of   the
representations,  warranties,  covenants  and  agreements  of  the  parties

and  representations set forth in Section 3.13 shall survive for  a  period
ten  (10)  years  from the Closing Date; and, provided  further,  that  the
warranties and representations set forth in Section 3.8, the obligations of
the  parties with respect to the payment of any state and local  sales  and
transfer  taxes  with respect to the Personal Property  (as  set  forth  in
Section 1.5), and the obligations under Section 2.7.B shall survive  for  a
period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, or such later date on which
the statute of limitations for any Taxes covered thereby has expired.  None
of  the warranties and representations of Apple set forth in this Agreement

8.2  Indemnification.

      A.    By  Apple.   Apple shall indemnify, defend, and  hold  harmless
NEWCO,  SCI  and  their  respective  subsidiaries,  affiliates,  directors,
officers,   employees,  representatives  and  agents   (collectively,   the
"Indemnified SCI Persons"), and reimburse the Indemnified SCI Persons  for,
from,  and  against  all  demands, claims, actions  or  causes  of  action,
assessments,  losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses,  including,
without  limitation,  interest, penalties and reasonable  attorneys'  fees,
disbursements  and expenses, imposed on or incurred by the Indemnified  SCI
Persons, directly or indirectly, by reason of

(i)  any  breach  by  Apple  of any of its representations  and  warranties
     contained in this Agreement,

(ii) any  failure  by  Apple  to  perform  any  covenant,  undertaking   or
     obligation on its part hereunder,

(iii)      all  Liens  referred  to  in  Section  3.5  (including,  without
     limitation, Permitted Liens for Taxes not yet delinquent and Permitted
     Liens for Taxes which are being contested by Apple in good faith),

(iv) the  failure  of  Apple hereto to comply with the  provisions  of  any
     applicable  bulk  sales, fraudulent conveyance or other  law  for  the
     protection of creditors,

(v)  any liability related to the Excluded Assets, and/or

(vi) any other liability of Apple other than the Assumed Liabilities.

      B.   By SCI.  SCI shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Apple and
its    subsidiaries,    affiliates,   directors,    officers,    employees,
representatives and agents (collectively, the "Indemnified Apple Persons"),
and  reimburse  the Indemnified Apple Persons for, from,  and  against  all
demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages,
liabilities,  costs and expenses, including, without limitation,  interest,
penalties  and  reasonable  attorneys' fees,  disbursements  and  expenses,
imposed  on  or  incurred  by the Indemnified Apple  Persons,  directly  or
indirectly, by reason of

(i)  any  breach  by  SCI  of  any  of its representations  and  warranties
     contained in this Agreement,

(ii) any  failure by SCI to perform any covenant, undertaking or obligation
     on its part hereunder, and/or

     applicable  bulk  sales, fraudulent conveyance or other  law  for  the

                               114
<PAGE>



      C.    If any action or claim shall be brought or asserted against  an
indemnified  party  under this Section 8.2 or any  successor  thereto  (the
"Indemnified  Party") in respect of which indemnity may be sought  from  an
indemnifying  party under this Section 8.2 (the "Indemnifying Party"),  the
Indemnified Party shall immediately notify the Indemnifying Party who shall
assume  the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory  to  the Indemnified Party and the payment  of  all  expenses;
except that any delay or failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party  shall
only  relieve  the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder  to  the
extent,  if at all, that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by reason  of
such  delay  or  failure.  The Indemnified Party shall have  the  right  to
employ  separate counsel in any such action and participate in the  defense
thereof,  but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne  by  the
Indemnified  Party  unless  (i)  the employment  thereof  shall  have  been
specifically directed and required by the Indemnifying Party  or  (ii)  the
Indemnifying  Party shall have elected not to assume the  defense  of  such
claim  and  employ counsel.  Without the consent of the Indemnified  Party,
the  Indemnifying Party shall have no right to settle or compromise on  any
non-monetary matter.

8.3   Limitation  of  Liability.   The  obligation  of  either  party  (the
"Indemnifying  Party")  hereunder  to  indemnify  the  other   party   (the
"Indemnified  Party") against any damages or claims  with  respect  to  the
matters  set  forth  in  this Agreement shall be  subject  to  all  of  the
following limitations:

      A.    No  indemnification  shall  be  required  to  be  made  by  the
Indemnifying  Party under this Section 8 or otherwise under this  Agreement
for  any  damages  or  claims in an amount less than One  Thousand  Dollars
($1,000)  for each such claim, unless and until the aggregate of  all  such
claims exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000).

      B.    The  Indemnifying  Party shall be obligated  to  indemnify  the
Indemnified  Party  only  for those damages and  claims  as  to  which  the
Indemnified  Party has given the Indemnifying Party written notice  thereof
on  or  prior  to that date which is five (5) years after the Closing  Date
(whether or not such damages or claims have then actually been sustained or
incurred);  provided,  however,  that  with  respect  to  any  claims   for
indemnification  under Section 3.13, the period shall  be  ten  (10)  years
after  the Closing Date; and, provided, further, that with respect  to  any
claims  for  indemnification under Section 1.5, Section 2.7.B  and  Section
3.8,  the  period shall be five (5) years or such later date on  which  the
statute  of  limitations for any Taxes covered thereby  has  expired.   Any
written notice delivered by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant  to this Section 8.3.B shall set forth the basis of the claim  for
damages  (including, without limitation, reference to the specific warranty
or  representation alleged to have been breached) and, if then determinable
by  the Indemnified Party, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof (or,
if  the Indemnified Party's good faith opinion, no such reasonable estimate
can  then  be  made, the maximum potential damages that in the  Indemnified
Party's  good  faith  opinion might be sustained in  connection  with  such
claim).

      C.    All  damages  shall be computed net of any  actual  income  tax
benefit  resulting  therefrom to the Indemnified  Party  or  any  insurance
coverage with respect thereto which reduces or may reduce the damages  that
would otherwise be sustained.
                               115
<PAGE>



      D.    In no event shall the Indemnifying Party's aggregate obligation
to  indemnify the Indemnified Party for damages exceed an amount  equal  to
twenty percent (20%) of that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the
Real Property and the Personal Property (that is, net of the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to the Initial Inventory); provided, however, that
such  limitation  shall  not apply to any claims for  indemnification  with
regard to any party's obligations with respect to Taxes, as in Section 1.5,
Section 2.7.B and Section 3.8 of this Agreement.

      E.    Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,  no
director,   officer  or  employee  of any party  shall  have  any  personal
liability  to  any other party as a result of such party's  breach  of  any
warranty or representation hereunder.

9.   CERTAIN OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.

9.1  Further Assurances.

      A.    Upon the request of any of NEWCO, SCI or Apple, any other party
will  execute and deliver to the requesting party, or such party's nominee,
all  such instruments and documents of further assurance or otherwise,  and
will do any and all such acts and things, as may reasonably be required  to
carry  out  the obligations of such party hereunder and to more effectively
consummate the Transaction, including obtaining all consents and  approvals
from  foreign governmental authorities and from third parties under  leases
and other contracts, agreements or obligations with respect to the Assets.

      B.   After the Closing, NEWCO, SCI and Apple shall from time to time,
at  the request of any other party, and without further cost or expense  to
the  requesting  party,  execute  and deliver  such  other  instruments  of
conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as the requesting party
may  reasonably  require,  in  order to  more  effectively  consummate  the
Transaction,  including  without limitation  any  reasonably  necessary  or
appropriate to vest in NEWCO good and marketable title to the Assets to  be
transferred  hereunder,  and  to effect the  assumption  by  NEWCO  of  the
Assigned Contracts, and any reasonably necessary or appropriate to transfer
or  assign to NEWCO any of the Assigned Permits, or to vest in SCI title to
the Shares.

9.2  Access and Inspection.

      A.    Prior  to  Closing.  At all times after the execution  of  this
Agreement  and up to and including the Closing Date, Apple shall give  SCI,
and  its  authorized  representatives,  reasonable  access,  during  normal
business  hours,  to the Assets, and Apple's employees,  books,  contracts,
commitments  and records as they relate to the Assets, for the  purpose  of
enabling  SCI to make such investigation of the Assets as SCI  may  desire,
including,  without limitation, having surveys and tests made of  the  Real
Property, all as more particularly set forth in Section 5.1 above.
                               116

shall  cause  NEWCO to provide, to the officers, agents, and  employees  of
Apple,  reasonable access during normal business hours  to  the  books  and
records  of  Apple  transferred  to NEWCO  hereunder  (if  any);  provided,
however, that with respect to any such books and records applicable to  the
matters  covered by Section 3.13, SCI agrees that it shall retain or  shall
cause  NEWCO to retain all such books and records for a period of ten  (10)
years  following the Closing Date.  SCI agrees not to destroy nor to permit
NEWCO to destroy any such books or records without prior written notice  to
Apple  and a reasonable opportunity for Apple, at Apple's expense, to  take
custody  thereof.   Any access and inspection rights of Apple  pursuant  to
this  Section 9.2.B shall in no way be in derogation of or supersede or  be
deemed  to  be  in  conflict  with any rights  Apple  may  have  under  the
Manufacturing Agreement or any of the other Related Agreements with respect
to access and inspection.

9.3   Notification of Certain Matters.  Each party shall provide the  other
with prompt notice of (i) any communication alleging that the consent of  a
Person  is or may be required in connection with the Transaction, (ii)  any
communication  from  any  governmental regulatory agency  or  authority  in
connection  with  the  Transaction, and (iii) any Proceeding  commenced  or
threatened  which would have been required to be disclosed by either  party
in connection with such party's warranties and representations as set forth
in this Agreement.

completely filled in at the time this Agreement is executed by the parties,
such exhibits shall be completed as promptly as possible thereafter, and in
no event any later than the Closing.

     B.   If either party discovers, at any time prior to the Closing Date,
any information which would make the warranties and representations of such
party,  as set forth in this Agreement, untrue or incomplete to a  material
extent, or make the exhibits as attached hereto incorrect or misleading  in
any  material manner, or which is needed to accurately reflect  the  rights
and obligations of either party under this Agreement, then such party shall
promptly inform the other party, and the relevant portion of this Agreement
and/or  the relevant exhibit(s) shall be amended or modified as appropriate
to incorporate such new or additional information.

9.5   Confidentiality.  All information disclosed by one party to the other
in  connection with the Transaction, including all information generated by
SCI  during  the  performance of its Due Diligence, shall be  held  by  the

in respect  to  such  subject matter.  If any term or provision of this 
Agreement is found by a court  of competent  jurisdiction  to be void or 
unenforceable,  then  such  term  or provision  shall be deemed stricken 
from this Agreement, and the  remaining terms  and conditions hereof shall 
remain in full force and effect  to  the maximum  extent  possible,  or  such

Exhibit 10.B.15
               KALEIDA RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT
                    BETWEEN APPLE AND IBM

This is a Restructuring Agreement (hereinafter "Agreement") made effective
November 16th, 1995, between Apple Computer, Inc. (hereinafter "Apple"), a
California corporation having its principal place of business in Cupertino,
California, and International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") a New
York corporation having its principal place of business in Armonk, New
York.

1.   GENERAL PLAN

1.1  Apple and IBM are the two principal shareholders in, and have in the
past been the sole providers of funds to, Kaleida Labs, Inc. ("Kaleida"), a
Delaware corporation having its principal place of business in Mountain
View, California.  The parties have decided to make fundamental changes in
Kaleida (hereinafter called the "Restructuring").  Both parties intend to
continue to use Kaleida's ScriptX technology, but to do so in a more
efficient and cost effective manner.  The parties have agreed that they
will cause Kaleida to cease to exist as a separate operating entity,
although Kaleida will continue as a legal entity.  At some later date, the
parties may decide to formally dissolve Kaleida, Kaleida employees,
customers and the public will begin to be informed of the planned changes
on approximately 11/16/95.  Effective approximately 1/16/96, Kaleida will
have no employees and will cease its operations.

1.2  Apple plans to hire a "Core Team" of approximately 10 to 15 Kaleida
employees to continue maintenance and enhancements to ScriptX, which will
be subject to a separate ScriptX Development and License Agreement ("SDLA")
between Apple and IBM.  The parties' obligations and rights relating to
this continuing maintenance and enhancements to ScriptX will be as defined
in that SDLA.

2.   TRANSITION

2.1  It is anticipated that the phasing out of Kaleida's operations will
extend from the current date until some uncertain period of time after
Kaleida ceases its operations (hereinafter called the "Transition Period").
The parties will cause their representatives to oversee the termination of
Kaleida employees, deal with customer claims and support issues, and in
general manage all other aspects of the Restructuring.  The parties will
jointly manage the Restructuring during the Transition Period with a
Transition Team comprised of people with financial, technical, legal, human
resources and other necessary skills from each of the parties.  Mr. David
Nagel of Apple and Mr. Steven Mills of IBM, or their designees, will
resolve any disagreements that the Transition Team cannot resolve.  This
Transition Team will develop and implement action plans to resolve all
issues, will quickly respond to new issues, and will track all issues until
resolved,
                             136
<PAGE>

2.2  All costs of the Restructuring through the Transition Period are
subject to approval by both parties, including such costs as separation
payments to employees, customer and other third party claims, settlement of
Toshiba's share for liquidation/ dissolution value, administrative
expenses, other Kaleida debts, legal and other fees, etc.  Payment of such
costs shall be initially made from Kaleida funds.  If such funds are
insufficient, the parties intend to provide such additional funds as are
approved by the parties, split equally between Apple and IBM.  The parties
do not intend to make the 4th quarter 1995 payment to Kaleida according to
the existing Funding Agreement.  The parties will develop a process to
compensate each other for a pro rata share of any agreed to restructuring
costs that are expended directly by one party.

2.3  In addition, the parties may agree to retain the services of certain
former Kaleida employees on a part time basis after 1/16/96 to assist in
performing administrative and other work during the Transition Period.  The
parties will share equally the costs of retaining the services of such
persons.

3.   TOSHIBA

The parties will mutually determine a fair resolution of the value of
Toshiba's share of Kaleida.  An offer will be made to Toshiba in return for
Toshiba's relinquishing its shares in Kaleida and releasing any claims
against Kaleida, Apple and IBM.

4.   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

4.1  The parties agree that the best way to preserve the intellectual
property ("IP") assets of Kaleida is to keep Kaleida as a non-operating
corporation, which will own the IP assets only and have no employees.
Following Toshiba's relinquishment of its shares, Kaleida will be owned 50%
by each party.  The parties will cause Kaleida to be jointly managed by
representatives of the parties and the parties shall advance to Kaleida in
equal amounts, all administrative and operating costs required in excess of
Kaleida's resources.  Necessary corporate documents will be modified to
simplify the administration, requiring a single board member from each
company and other changes.  If and when the parties later formally dissolve
Kaleida, they intend to agree at that time on ownership of IP assets and
any additional licenses that may be needed.

4.2  Under the Multimedia License Agreement entered into among Kaleida,
Apple, and IBM on May 5, 1992 ("MLA") each party has equivalent broad
rights to Kaleida's IP assets on a worldwide, perpetual basis, including
copyrighted ScriptX technology, COS, Malibu, ITV and any other Kaleida
technologies.  In complete satisfaction of the royalty obligations of each
party, the parties will cause Kaleida to accept the cancellation of its pre-
paid royalty obligations to each party and the licenses under the MLA will
become pre-paid and royalty free.  Promptly after completion of the process
described in Section 4.3, the parties will cause Kaleida to deliver to each
party a copy of all existing Company Materials and Development
Environments, which will include the most current electronic and hardcopy
versions of the code (source and object), all documentation, all training
materials, etc., (hereinafter called "Transfer Event").  Each parties use
                             137
<PAGE>

of the Company Materials will be subject to the license grant in Section
6.1 of the MLA, except that SubSections 6.1.1.2, 6.1.1.3, and 6.1.1.6 of
that Section are deleted.  Further, the parties agree that all Type I Code
becomes Type II Code as of the date of this Agreement and that the
Development Environments will be licensed according to the terms of Section
6.1, not Section 6.2. The parties also agree that the procedures in Section
4.2 of the MLA need not be followed.  The parties will resolve later any
rights to Kaleida trademarks they may require.

4.3  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the licenses from the Parents to
Kaleida and from Kaleida to the Parents in the MLA will not include any
Parent Materials that have not been incorporated into Company Materials or
used as part of a Development Environment to create or maintain Company
Materials (hereinafter called "Unused Parent Materials").  Prior to the
Transfer Event, the parties will use best efforts to cause all Materials at
Kaleida to be inventoried and to determine which of the Materials are
Unused Parent Materials.  Any copies of Unused Parent Materials found on
Kaleida's premises will, at the contributing Parent's election, either be
returned to the contributing Parent or destroyed.  Once the Transfer Event
has occurred, however, each party will have the complete rights as defined
in Section 4.2 to use the Company Materials in accordance with the license
in the MLA, even if such Company Materials inadvertently contain any Unused
Parent Materials.  The parties will enter into and will cause Kaleida to
enter into an amendment to the MLA to effectuate the provisions of this
Agreement.

4.4  This Agreement does not modify the Malibu Agreement between Apple and
IBM, dated June 27. 1995.

5.   KALEIDA PERSONNEL

The parties will cause Kaleida to provide its employees with 60 days
written notice of termination and separation benefits approved by the
parties.  IBM and Apple may hire certain employees, in addition to the
"Core Team" required for the SDLA.  While the other party's permission or
review will not be required for any hiring decisions, the requirements for
the Core Team will first be identified.  Neither party will interfere with
the attempt by Apple to hire the necessary Kaleida employees into the Core
Team.

6.   OTHER KALEIDA ASSETS

The parties will cause Kaleida to inventory all its non-IP assets.  The
parties will agree on whether assets will be liquidated or distributed
following the settlement with Toshiba.  If assets are liquidated, the
proceeds are to be distributed equally.  The parties will agree on an equal
distribution of all other non-liquidated assets, with appropriate
requirements of the Core Team considered first,

7.   OTHER

The parties will cause any necessary Kaleida corporate documents to be
created or amended in order to effectuate any of the actions described
above, including Board resolutions, amendments
                             138
<PAGE>

to By-Laws, assignments, licenses, etc.  This Agreement shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.  This Agreement shall be governed by New York law.  This Agreement
shall  is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and is not intended
nor shall it be construed as creating any rights in any third party
(including without limitation Kaleida or its other shareholder or
creditors).  This Agreement may be amended or terminated only by written
agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their Authorized Representatives.
