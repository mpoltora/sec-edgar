             OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
            (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)

Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company") at March 31, 1997 and December 31,
1996, the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 1997 and
1996, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 1997 and 1996.  These
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in the
Company's 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In general, the business of the
Company's industry segments is not seasonal.

First Quarter Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------

Sales
- -----

Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 1997 increased 10% over the prior
year to $4,045.   The consolidated sales growth resulted from a 12% increase
due to volume and a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign
currency translation.  Changes in selling prices had no effect on total sales
growth.  Domestic sales increased 11% and international sales increased 9%
(14% excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation).
Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 1996 increased 11% compared to the
first quarter of 1995.

              MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
        OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
       (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


Sales in the pharmaceutical products segment, which is the largest segment at
60% of total Company sales, increased 12% over the first quarter of 1996 to
$2,416.  Sales growth resulted from a 14% increase in volume and a 2% decrease
due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.  Selling prices had no
effect on sales for the quarter.  Excluding sales of CAPOTEN*, sales of
pharmaceutical products increased 20%.  Sales of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's
largest selling product, increased 48% to $374.  PRAVACHOL* continues to
benefit from the results of the landmark five-year West of Scotland Coronary
Prevention Study and the five-year Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE)
trial, and from the PRAVACHOL* Public Awareness Program on First Heart Attack
Prevention.  This direct-to-consumer campaign is raising awareness about the
risks of a first heart attack and is helping to motivate people to take action
with their physicians to reduce the risks.   Sales of TAXOL* (R) (paclitaxel),
the company's leading anti-cancer agent, increased 10% to $218 as compared to
a strong first quarter in 1996.  Sales of PARAPLATIN* increased 12% to $99.
Glucophage, an oral medication for treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes,
sales increased 97% to $126.  BUSPAR*, the Company's novel anti-anxiety agent,
and SERZONE*, an antidepressant with a low incidence of side effects, recorded
strong growth at 21% and 59%, respectively.  Strong gains were also recorded
for ZERIT* and VIDEX*, the Company's two antiretroviral agents, both of which
have benefited from positive regulatory agency actions in the U.S., Canada and
Europe and from ongoing clinical trials showing the efficacy of combination
therapy.  In January 1997, a new oral solution of ZERIT* was introduced,
representing a significant addition to the limited therapeutic options
available to treat HIV-infected infants and children. Sales of CEFZIL*, which
received additional clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for use in the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adult and pediatric
patients during the fourth quarter of 1996, increased 84% to $100.  Strong
growth of the anti-hypertensive MONOPRIL*, a second generation angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with once-a-day dosage, increase 29% to
$75.  Sales of MAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable cephalosporin, were
$21, an increase of 122% over the prior year.  Sales of the Oncology
Therapeutics Network, a company acquired in September 1996, also contributed
to the sales growth of the segment.  Increases in sales of these products were
partially offset by a 33% decline in sales of captopril, sold primarily under
the trademark CAPOTEN*.   This decrease is primarily due to the loss of its
patent exclusivity in the U.S. in February 1996.  For the first quarter of
1996, sales of the pharmaceutical products segment increased 14% over the
first quarter of 1995 as a result of increases in sales of TAXOL*, PRAVACHOL*,
BUSPAR*, MONOPRIL*, SERZONE*, ZERIT* and VIDEX*, and the introductory sales of
Glucophage and MAXIPIME*.  The increases in sales of these products was
partially offset by a decrease in sales of CAPOTEN*.

               MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
         OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
        (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


Sales of the nonprescription health products segment increased 10% to $741,
reflecting a 12% increase due to volume, and a 2% decrease due to the
unfavorable effect of foreign currency.  Nutritional product sales increased
12%.  Sales of ENFAMIL*, the Company's largest selling infant formula, as well
as PROSOBEE*, NUTRAMIGEN* and LACTOFREE* special infant formulas performed
well.  Mead Johnson, the Company's nutritional division, continues to build on
its leading share of the U.S. infant formula market.  BOOST*, SUSTAGEN* and
SUSTACAL* nutritional beverages also contributed to sales growth.   Sales of
analgesics, increased primarily due to strong volume growth of EFFERALGAN*,
DAFALGAN* and ASPIRINE UPSA* from the UPSA Group.  KERI* skin care products
and COMTREX* cough/cold remedies also contributed to domestic sales growth.
During the first quarter, the Company received clearance from the FDA to market
VAGISTAT-1*, the first and only one-dose over-the-counter (OTC) medication for
vaginal yeast infections, which was launched in April 1997.  For the first
quarter of 1996, the nonprescription health products segment sales increased
16%, compared to the first quarter of 1995,  primarily due to increased sales
of infant formulas and analgesics.

Sales of the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 13% over the prior
year to $453, reflecting a 13% increase due to volume, a 1% increase due to
selling prices, and a 1% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign
currency.  Sales of hair care products increased due to strong market growth
of HERBAL ESSENCES*, INFUSIUM 23* and SYSTEME BIOLAGE* complete lines of
shampoos and conditioners.  CLAIROL HYDRIENCE*, a unique water-based permanent
haircolor, launched in June 1996, has achieved rapid market acceptance and
exhibited strong sales growth.  Also contributing to the growth of the
Company's haircoloring products were NICE 'N EASY*, NATURAL INSTINCTS* and
LASTING COLOR BY LOVING CARE*.  Clairol is the U.S. haircoloring market leader
and continues to expand its market share.  SEA BREEZE* skin care products,
experienced significant volume growth in the Japanese marketplace.  BAN*
antiperspirants and deodorants contributed to domestic sales growth.  For the
first quarter of 1996, sales of the toiletries and beauty aids segment
increased 8% over the prior year, primarily due to increases in sales of
haircoloring and hair care products.

In the medical devices segment, sales of $435 were 1% below prior year levels,
reflecting a 4% increase due to volume, a 2% decrease due to selling prices
and a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency
translation.  Sales of ostomy and DUODERM* wound care products increased 10%
and 20%, respectively, due to volume growth in the U.S. and international
markets.  Zimmer achieved volume growth of 3% which was more than offset by
significant pressure on price and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange
rate fluctuations.  The Company's Zimmer knee and hip replacements, and
ConvaTec's  ostomy and modern wound care products, continue to be world market
share leaders.  For the first quarter of 1996, medical devices segment sales
decreased 3% from the prior year, due to decreased sales of ostomy and wound
care products and prosthetic implants.

       (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


Cost of Products Sold and Operating Expenses
- --------------------------------------------

Total costs and expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 1997, as a percentage
of sales, remained at prior year levels of approximately 72.0%.  Cost of
products sold increased to 26.7% of sales from 25.5% in 1996 due to changes in
product sales mix.  Expenditures for advertising and promotion in support of
new and existing products increased 16% to $497 from $427 in 1996 and, as a
percentage of sales, increased to 12.3% from 11.6% in 1996.  This increase is
primarily due to increased spending on direct-to-consumer campaigns for several
pharmaceutical products as well as incremental support of toiletries and beauty
aids.  Marketing, selling, administrative and other expenses increased 3% to
$1,011 and, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 25.0% in 1997 from 26.8% in
1996.  Research and development expenses increased 8% to $326 from $302 in
1996, and as a percentage of sales, were 8.1% compared to 8.2%.  Pharmaceutical
research and development spending increased 12% over the first quarter of 1996.
In 1996, pharmaceutical research and development spending increased 3% over the
first quarter of 1995.

Earnings
- --------

Earnings before income taxes for the first quarter increased 11% to $1,133 from
$1,022 in 1996.  The effective tax rate on earnings before taxes decreased to
28.5% in the first quarter of 1997 from 29.0% in 1996, reflecting the benefit
of increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.  Net earnings increased 12%
to $810 from $726 and earnings per share increased 13% to $.81 from $.72 in
1996.  The growth in earnings per share exceeded the growth in net earnings by
1% as a result of the Company's share repurchase program.  (In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share,
diluted earnings per share was $.79 in 1997 and $.71 in 1996.)

Financial Position
- ------------------

The balance sheet at March 31, 1997 and the statement of cash flows for the
three months then ended reflect the Company's strong financial position.  The
Company continues to maintain a high level of working capital totaling
$2.6 billion at March 31, 1997.

Internally generated funds continue to be the Company's primary source for
financing expenditures for new plant and equipment.  Additions to fixed assets
for the three months ended March 31, 1997 were $121 compared to $115 during
the same period of 1996.

During the three months ended March 31, 1997, the Company purchased 4.2 million
shares of its common stock at a total cost of $253.

                         ----------------------------

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its
business are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.  The
most significant of these are reported in the Company's Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1996 with material developments since that
report described below.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K, the Company, together with
its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC) and certain other
companies, has been named as a defendant in a number of claims and lawsuits in
federal and state courts and in certain Canadian provincial courts, alleging
damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane
covered breast implants and smooth walled breast implants formerly manufactured
by MEC or its predecessors.  As of April 17, 1997, approximately 23,800 such
plaintiffs had filed suit.  A number of other manufacturers of breast implants,
as well as suppliers of component parts and other parties, are also defendants
in the majority of these cases.  The majority of the suits are presently stayed
except for those filed by plaintiffs who have opted out of a revised class
action settlement approved by the Honorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr., Chief Judge
of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.
Appeals related to the Revised Settlement are pending.

In early 1996, notices describing the Revised Settlement were mailed to breast
implant recipients, including the approximately 380,000 domestic class members
(with implants of all manufacturers, not just MEC, Baxter and 3M) who originally
registered with the settlement.  The claims office has reported that as of
April 11, 1997, approximately 133,000 of these registrants (28,000 of whom do
not have an implant of MEC, Baxter  or 3M) had submitted proof of
manufacturer documentation, which will enable the claims office to determine
whether they have a breast implant made by MEC, Baxter or 3M.  The claims office
has further reported that as of April 11, 1997, over 71,000 of these registrants
had been sent Notification of Status letters advising them of their status in
the settlement.  Over 50,000 of these persons have established to the
satisfaction of the claims office that they have an implant of one of the three
major Settling Defendants and have chosen to participate in the settlement.

The claims office has been sending Notification of Status letters to class
members on an ongoing basis, and is expected to continue to do so during the
first half of 1997.  The claims office reports that as of April 11, 1997,
approximately 29,000 of the original 380,000 domestic registrants (with
implants of all manufacturers) opted out.  Many of these opt-outs have not had
to identify the manufacturer of their implants and are not expected to have an
implant associated with MEC.  The Company also estimates that approximately
2,200 claims based upon MEC implants remain from among the 7,100 domestic class
members who previously opted out of the settlement originally approved in 1994.
Because the opt-out period for many class members has not expired, and because
our information is incomplete, it is not possible to estimate on any

reliable and precise basis either the total number of women who will opt-out
of the Revised Settlement or, of those who opt-out, the number who will file
lawsuits against the Company.


Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K referred to above, the
Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are or have been defendants in a
number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of purported
statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products and by the
Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging a price
fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade
practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  On June 7, 1996, the
Company reached a settlement covering all the then pending infant formula
indirect purchaser cases except the case in Massachusetts and the case brought
by the Louisiana Attorney General.  On September 29, 1996, a federal district
court in Tallahassee, Florida, entered an order in favor of the defendants,
effectively dismissing the Louisiana Attorney General action.  No appeal was
taken from that decision.  In December, 1996 the Company entered an agreement
in principle to settle the Massachusetts action.  Final court approval of the
above settlements has been granted in every case except those pending in
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and Nevada.  In Louisiana, on
January 21, 1997, the court entered an order disapproving the settlement.
On April 22, 1997, the Louisiana court denied a motion for reconsideration of
its January 21, 1997 ruling.  In the other jurisdictions, joint motions for the
final approval of the settlement have either not yet been filed (Massachusetts)
or not yet been ruled upon (Michigan and Nevada).  In April 1997, a new case
was filed in state court in Missouri.  No responsive pleadings or other
actions have yet occurred in that case.

Pharmaceutical Pricing Litigation
- ---------------------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K, the Company is a defendant
in numerous antitrust actions brought by retailers against the Company and
other pharmaceutical manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit
managers that have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  On April 8, 1997, eight
retail pharmacies, representative plaintiffs for the class of retailers
previously certified in the federal brand name prescription drug pricing
litigation and with whom the Company and certain other manufacturer defendants
entered into the settlement agreement approved by the District Court in 1996
and currently subject to appeals by objecting class members in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, filed a new class action
complaint against the Company and the other settling defendants.   The new
complaint alleges that the Company and the other defendants have continued
since the settlement to engage in a price fixing conspiracy and seeks
injunctive relief.  These plaintiffs have requested an "interlocutory"
injunction against the Company and the other settling defendants in this new
action and against the defendants that have not settled in the original
prescription drug class action.  Plaintiffs have moved for a hearing on their
application for an "interlocutory" injunction, but the Court has not yet
granted that motion or scheduled such a hearing.
