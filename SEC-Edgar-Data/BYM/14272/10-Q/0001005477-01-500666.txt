                          BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
           (Unaudited, dollars in millions except per share amounts)

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal adjustments)
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company (the "Company") at June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the
results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,
and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000. These
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in the
Company's 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the
Company's independent accountants, have performed a review of the unaudited
consolidated financial statements included herein, and their review report
thereon accompanies this filing.

NOTE 2: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In September 2000, the Company announced the planned divestitures of its beauty
care business "Clairol" and orthopaedic business "Zimmer". Accordingly, the
operations of Clairol (which includes its Matrix affiliate) and Zimmer have been
reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements.

On August 6, 2001, Zimmer was distributed to the Company's stockholders in a
tax-free spin-off. In May 2001, the Company reached an agreement to sell Clairol
to Procter & Gamble for $4.95 billion.

The net sales and earnings of discontinued operations are as follows:

Cash flows from operating and investing activities of discontinued operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 were $119 million and $245
million, respectively.

NOTE 3: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," as amended, which requires that all derivative instruments be
recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at
fair value. The adoption of this accounting requirement did not have a material
effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates
and interest rates. As a result, the Company utilizes foreign exchange option
and forward contracts to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany inventory
purchases expected to occur within the next year. For these derivatives, which
qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair
value is temporarily recorded in comprehensive income, then recognized in
earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of
hedges is reported in earnings as it occurs. The fair value of derivative
instruments, which is recorded in prepaid expenses, at June 30, 2001 was $48
million.

To manage interest rate risk, the Company utilizes interest rate swap contracts.
The Company will enter into interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of
adverse changes in interest rates on consolidated results of operations and
future cash outflows for interest. These interest rate swap contracts allow the
Company to establish a fixed interest rate on anticipated debt issuances. Gains
and losses from changes in fair value on interest rate swap contracts designated
as cash flow hedges are initially deferred and recorded in other comprehensive
income. Amounts are transferred from other comprehensive income and recognized
in earnings as Interest Expense in the same period that the hedged item is
recognized in earnings.

In the second quarter 2001, the Company entered into interest rate hedge
contracts, with a notional amount of $1 billion, to manage its exposure to
changes in interest rates for long-term fixed-rate debt expected to be issued in
a future period in connection with the acquisition of the DuPont Pharmaceuticals
Company (see note 5). The contracts were designated as hedges of the variability
of the cash flows due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. At
June 30, 2001, the Company recorded the contract at

fair value, resulting in a $7 million deferred gain in accumulated other
comprehensive income.

The Company recorded a transition adjustment as of January 1, 2001 of $26
million, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income to record the hedging
instruments at their fair value. A reconciliation of current period changes, net
of taxes, included in other comprehensive income follows:

</Table>

Substantially all of the $26 million, net of taxes, gain on cash flow hedging
deferred in other comprehensive income, is expected to be reclassified to
earnings over the next year. The change in time value of options, excluded from
the measure of effectiveness, reported in earnings for the second quarter and
six months, was not material.

NOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number
of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share are
computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
year, plus the incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive
stock options.

The computations for basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per
common share are as follows:

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income for the three-month
and six-month periods ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 and the consolidated
statement of cash flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2001 and 2000.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures to financial
data and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should
be made to the accompanying consolidated interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

We previously audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America, the consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
income and retained earnings and of cash flows for the year then ended (not
presented herein), and in our report dated January 24, 2001 we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion,
the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2000, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

SECOND QUARTER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales for the second quarter of 2001 increased 7% (9% excluding foreign
exchange) over the prior year to $4,709 million. The consolidated sales growth
resulted from a 7% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in
selling prices and a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. U.S.
sales increased 10% and international sales increased 1% (8% excluding foreign
exchange).

Worldwide pharmaceutical sales increased 8% (10% excluding foreign exchange).
U.S. pharmaceutical sales increased 12% and international pharmaceutical sales
increased 1% (8% excluding foreign exchange).

GLUCOPHAGE (metformin), is the leading branded oral medication for treatment of
non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes. The entire GLUCOPHAGE franchise
continued its strong growth rate, with sales increasing 57% to $763 million.
GLUCOPHAGE sales increased 7% to $517 million while sales of GLUCOVANCE,
launched in August 2000, and GLUCOPHAGE XR, launched in October 2000, were $135
million and $111 million, respectively.

Worldwide sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, increased 10% to
$448 million including a 16% increase in international sales net of foreign
exchange.

Sales of TAXOL* (paclitaxel), the Company's leading anti-cancer agent, decreased
21% to $325 million. International sales increased 7% (15% excluding foreign
exchange) to $165 million, led by strong sales growth in Japan and France while
domestic sales decreased 38% to $160 million, due to generic competition.

Sales of PLAVIX, a platelet aggregation inhibitor for the reduction of stroke,
heart attack and vascular death in atherosclerotic patients with recent stroke,
recent heart attack or peripheral arterial disease, continued their strong
growth, increasing 43% to $317 million. Sales of AVAPRO, an angiotensin II
receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 21% to $110
million. AVAPRO and PLAVIX are cardiovascular products that were launched from
the Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Synthelabo joint venture.

Sales of the anti-cancer agent PARAPLATIN* increased 8% to $172 million as the
product continues to benefit from its use in combination with other chemotherapy
agents.

Sales of BUSPAR*, an anti-anxiety agent, declined to $89 million from $194
million in the same period of 2000, due to generic competition.

Sales of VIDEX*, an anti-retroviral agent, increased 39% to $68 million due to
increased sales of VIDEX EC* enteric-coated beadlets, launched in 2000.

* Indicates brand names of products which are trademarks owned by the Company.


                                       11

Sales of TEQUIN*, a quinolone antibiotic, more than doubled to $58 million in
the quarter.

Sales of Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN), a specialty distributor of
anti-cancer medicines and related products, increased 39% to $357 million.

ENFAMIL*, the Company's largest-selling infant formula, recorded sales of $172
million, an increase of 8% from the prior year.

Sales of ostomy products increased 5% (10% excluding foreign exchange) to $114
million while sales of modern wound care products increased 9% (16% excluding
foreign exchange) to $61 million.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Total expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2001, as a percentage of sales,
improved to 68.1% from 69.2% in 2000 primarily due to containment of operating
expenses.

Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.6% from 25.6%
in 2000 due to increased sales of lower margin products from OTN and from a
change in product mix, primarily a decline in TAXOL* and BUSPAR* sales resulting
from generic competition. Marketing, selling, administrative and other expenses,
as a percentage of sales, declined to 20.0% in the quarter from 22.3% in 2000 as
a result of productivity, cost efficiencies and cost effectiveness. Expenditures
for advertising and promotion in support of new and existing products declined
14% to $424 million from $493 million in 2000 due to a reduction in support for
TAXOL* and BUSPAR*. Research and development expenditures increased 10% to $495
million from $450 million in 2000 as the Company increased its investment in
late stage compounds. Pharmaceutical research and development spending increased
11% over the prior year, and as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.7%
in the second quarter of 2001 compared with 12.3% in the second quarter of 2000.

EARNINGS

Earnings before income taxes increased 10% to $1,501 million compared with
$1,361 million in 2000. Net earnings increased 10% to $1,102 million compared

$.51 in 2000 and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $.56 from $.50 in
2000.

The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 26.6% compared
with 26.2% in 2000, as a result of lower production of TAXOL* and BUSPAR*.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Clairol sales increased 3% (5% excluding foreign exchange) to $489 million led
by an increase in sales of HERBAL ESSENCES*, a complete line of shampoos,
conditioners, styling aids, haircolor and body wash. Domestic sales increased 8%
while international sales decreased 4% (a 1% increase excluding foreign
exchange).


                                       12

levels (a 10% increase excluding foreign exchange). Sales of knee joint
replacements increased 16% (20% excluding foreign exchange) to $121 million, hip
replacements increased 14% (19% excluding foreign exchange) to $95 million and
fracture management sales rose 6% to $38 million.

On August 6, 2001, Zimmer was distributed to the Company's stockholders in a
tax-free spin-off.

In the second and third quarters of 2000, the Company sold its Sea Breeze brand
in Japan and Matrix Essentials, Inc. subsidiary, respectively. Sales and
earnings before taxes from these divested businesses/products, included in the
second quarter of 2000, were $117 million and $14 million, respectively.

Net earnings from discontinued operations were $99 million compared with $86
million for the second quarter of 2000.

SIX MONTHS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales for the first six months of 2001 increased 6% (8% excluding foreign
exchange) over the prior year to $9,398 million. The consolidated sales growth
resulted from a 6% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in
selling prices and a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. U.S.
sales increased 10% and international sales decreased 1% (a 6% increase
excluding foreign exchange).

Worldwide pharmaceutical sales increased 8% (10% excluding foreign exchange).
U.S. pharmaceutical sales increased 12% and international pharmaceutical sales
decreased 1% (a 6% increase excluding foreign exchange).

The entire GLUCOPHAGE franchise continued its strong growth rate, with sales
increasing 45% to $1,320 million. GLUCOPHAGE sales increased 14% to $1,036
million while GLUCOVANCE, launched in August 2000, and GLUCOPHAGE XR, launched
in October 2000, had sales of $160 million and $124 million, respectively.

increased 25% to $222 million. Sales of PARAPLATIN* increased 15% to $365
million. Sales of VIDEX*, an anti-retroviral agent, increased 35% to $127
million due to increased sales of VIDEX EC* enteric-coated beadlets launched in
2000. Sales of TEQUIN* were $127 million compared with $37 million in the same
period of 2000.

Sales of Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) were $678 million, an increase of

OPERATING EXPENSES

Total expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2001, as a percentage of sales,
improved to 66.1% from 67.4% in 2000 primarily due to containment of operating
expenses.

Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 28.0% from 25.6%
in 2000 due to increased sales of lower margin products from OTN and from a
change in product mix, primarily a decline in TAXOL* and BUSPAR* sales.
Marketing, selling, administrative and other expenses, as a percentage of sales,
declined to 18.9% in the first six months of 2001 from 21.7% in 2000 as a result
of productivity, cost efficiencies and cost effectiveness. Expenditures for
advertising and promotion declined 9% to $801 million from $883 million in 2000.
Research and development expenditures increased 12% to $1,003 million from $896
million in 2000 as the Company increased its investment in late stage compounds.
Pharmaceutical research and development spending increased 14% over the prior
year, and as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 13.0% in the first six
months of 2001 and 12.3% in the first six months of 2000.

In the second and third quarters of 2000, the Company sold its Sea Breeze brand
in Japan and Matrix Essentials, Inc. subsidiary, respectively. Sales and
earnings before taxes from these divested businesses/products, included in the
first six months of 2000, were $220 million and $27 million, respectively.

In 2001, earnings before income taxes include $11 million in costs related to
the spin-off of Zimmer and in 2000 include an $18 million restructuring charge.

Net earnings from discontinued operations were $192 million compared with $178
million for the first six months of 2000.

FINANCIAL POSITION

The balance sheet at June 30, 2001 and the statement of cash flows for the six
months then ended reflect the Company's strong financial position. The Company
continues to maintain a high level of working capital, $4.3 billion at June 30,
2001, increasing from $4.2 billion at December 31, 2000. Net assets of
discontinued operations of $948 million are included in the balance sheet at
June 30, 2001.

Short-Term borrowings were $162 million at June 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

Long-Term Debt decreased to $1,302 million from $1,336 million at December 31,
2000.

In connection with the financing of the Dupont Pharmaceuticals acquisition, in
July 2001, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under which the Company may issue up to $5 billion of
securities in the future in the form of debt securities, preferred stock, common
stock or warrants.

Internally generated funds continue to be the Company's primary source for
financing expenditures for new plant and equipment. Net Cash Provided by
Operating Activities increased to $2,383 million in 2001 from $1,584 million in
2000. As a result of the Company's investment in manufacturing and research
facilities, additions to fixed assets for the six months ended June 30, 2001
increased to $411 million from $192 million during the same period of 2000.

Cash flows from operating and investing activities of Discontinued Operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2001 were $119 million.

During the six months ended June 30, 2001, the Company purchased 22 million
shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.3 billion. In June 2001, the Company
announced a $2 billion increase in the amount authorized for the stock
repurchase program from $12 billion to $14 billion.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141 "Business Combinations" and No.
142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. SFAS No.


                                       15
<Page>

141 requires that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and addresses the initial
recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in
a business combination. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and
measurement of intangible assets acquired outside a business combination and the
recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent
to their acquisition. Under the new rules, goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with the statements. Other intangible assets will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The adoption of these
accounting requirements will not have a material effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered ordinary and
routine to its business are pending against the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries. The most significant of these are reported in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. Current
developments are described below.

TAXOL* LITIGATION

In 1997 and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits alleging that a number of
generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of administering
paclitaxel when they filed abbreviated new drug applications seeking regulatory
approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were consolidated for discovery in
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company did
not assert a monetary claim against any of the defendants, but sought to prevent
the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates the company's
patents.

The defendants asserted that they did not infringe the Company's patents and
that these patents are invalid and unenforceable. Some defendants also asserted
counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition
violations. The Company believed its patents were valid when it filed the suits
and the counterclaims asserted are believed to be without merit. Since the
filing of the suits four private actions have been filed by parties alleging
antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims relating to the Company's
action to obtain and enforce patent rights. The Federal Trade Commission and the
Attorney General of the State of Florida have each initiated investigations
relating to paclitaxel. At this time, neither agency has brought any claims
against the Company relating to paclitaxel, nor have they indicated whether any
such claims will be brought. The Company is cooperating in these investigations.

In early 2000 the District Court invalidated most claims of the company's
patents. On April 20, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit affirmed the District Court's summary judgment of invalidity of all but
two claims of the patents at issue. Those two claims relate to the low dose,
three-hour administration of paclitaxel in which the patient is given a
specified regimen of premedicants before the administration of paclitaxel. The
appellate court remanded those two claims to the District Court for further
proceedings.

In September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the United
States Food and Drug Administration for its Abbreviated New Drug Application for
paclitaxel and is marketing the product. Additional final approvals have since
been announced by the United States Food and Drug Administration and sales of
additional generic products have begun.

The Company is considering its options with respect to the two remaining claims
of its patents. It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment
as to the final outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. Nor is it possible
to reasonably estimate the impact those litigations and investigations might
have if the Company were not to prevail.


                                       17
<Page>

BUSPAR*

On November 21, 2000, the Company obtained a patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,365
("'365 patent"), relating to a method of using BuSpar* or buspirone. The Company
timely submitted information relating to the '365 patent to the FDA for listing
in an FDA publication commonly known as the "Orange Book", and the FDA
thereafter listed the patent in the Orange Book.

Delisting Suits. Generic drug manufacturers sued the FDA and the Company to
compel the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book. Although one
district court declined to order the delisting of the '365 patent, another
ordered the company to cause the delisting of the patent from the Orange Book.
The Company complied with the court's order but appealed the decision to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has not yet
decided the appeal.

Patent Suits. The Company is seeking to enforce the '365 patent in actions
against two generic drug manufacturers.

Antitrust Suits. Following the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange
Book, a number of purchasers of buspirone and several generic drug makers filed
lawsuits against the company alleging that it improperly triggered statutory
[Hatch-Waxman] marketing exclusivity. The central issue raised by these cases is
whether the Company improperly caused the listing of the '365 patent in the
Orange Book. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages, disgorgement and
injunctive relief.

Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) proceedings. The Company filed motions with the
Judicial Panel on MDL to have all of the patent and antitrust cases consolidated
and/or coordinated in a single forum. The Panel heard oral argument on the
motions in July and has taken them under advisement.

Government Investigations. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state
attorneys general have initiated investigations concerning the listing of the
'365 patent in the Orange Book. The Company is cooperating in these
investigations.

It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment as to the final
outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. Nor is it possible to reasonably
estimate the impact these litigations and investigations might have if the
company were not to prevail.

            2.4 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, DuPont shall deliver to Buyer an unaudited combined balance sheet of the
Transferred Business Companies, prepared by DuPont in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial Statements as of the
close of business (New York time) on the day specified in Schedule 3.5(a) (which
is based on the date on which the Closing occurs) (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING
BALANCE SHEET"), which shall be accompanied by (i) a calculation by DuPont of
Net Assets based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial Statements (the
"ESTIMATED NET ASSETS") and (ii) a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of
DuPont stating that the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Net Assets
have been prepared in accordance with this Section 2.4(a). The Pre-Adjusted
Closing Purchase Price shall


                                       29
<Page>

be (i) increased, if the Estimated Net Assets exceed the Reference Net Assets,
by an amount equal to the amount of such excess, or (ii) decreased, if the
Reference Net Assets exceed the Estimated Net Assets, by an amount equal to the
amount of such excess (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING ADJUSTMENT"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if the Reference Net Assets exceed the Estimated Net Assets by an amount
that is greater than zero ($0) and less than the Minimum Buyer Adjustment
Amount, then the amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment shall be zero ($0)
and the Estimated Net Assets shall be deemed to be equal to the Reference Net
Assets; PROVIDED, further that if the Estimated Net Assets exceed the Reference
Net Assets by an amount that is greater than zero ($0) and less than the Minimum
DuPont Adjustment Amount, then the amount of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
shall be zero ($0) and the Estimated Net Assets shall be deemed to be equal to
the Reference Net Assets. The Pre-Adjusted Closing Price, as so increased or
decreased, as the case may be, is hereinafter referred to as the Closing
Purchase Price.

                  (b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date but
in no event later than seventy-five days (75) thereafter, Buyer shall deliver to
DuPont an unaudited combined balance sheet of the Transferred Business
Companies, prepared by Buyer in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the Audited Financial Statements, as of the close of business
(New York time) on the Closing Date (the "PRELIMINARY CLOSING BALANCE SHEET"),
which shall be accompanied by (i) a calculation by Buyer of Net Assets based on
the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet (the "PRELIMINARY NET ASSETS") and (ii) a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer stating that, in his view,
the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and Preliminary Net Assets have been
prepared in accordance with this Section 2.4(b).

                  (c) DuPont shall have thirty (30) days following delivery to
DuPont of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
Preliminary Net Assets during which to review the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet and such calculations, and to notify Buyer if it believes that (i) the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet was not prepared in accordance with Section
2.4(b) or contains mathematical error or (ii) that the calculation of
Preliminary Net Assets was not in accordance with the definition of Net Assets
contained herein, not calculated in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or contains
mathematical error, and, in each case, specifying the reasons therefor in
reasonable detail (in which case such notification shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of DuPont stating that he concurs
with DuPont's position set forth in such notice). In connection with such
review, Buyer shall provide (or, in the case of access to PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP and its work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide) DuPont and its Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all work
papers,


                                       30
<Page>

schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Buyer or its
Representatives in connection with its preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and/or its calculation of Preliminary Net Assets (and shall be
entitled to copies thereof) and to finance personnel of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and any other information which DuPont reasonably requests, and
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably with
DuPont and its Representatives in connection therewith. If (A) DuPont fails to
notify Buyer of any such dispute within such 30-day period, or (B) the aggregate
amount of the items disputed by DuPont is such that, were DuPont's position
adopted, it would not result in an amount payable pursuant to Section 2.4(e)
that is at least $5 million greater or less than would be the case if the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet were deemed final, the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of Preliminary Net Assets shall be deemed
final. In the event that DuPont shall so notify Buyer of any dispute, DuPont and
Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as
possible, and upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet and Preliminary Net Assets shall be made in accordance
with the agreement of Buyer and DuPont.

                  (d) If Buyer and DuPont are unable to resolve any such dispute
within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as Buyer and DuPont shall
mutually agree in writing) of DuPont's delivery of such notice, such dispute
shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination
shall be final and binding on the parties; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the
calculation of Final Net Assets shall be based on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet and the definitions contained herein and (ii) unless the Independent
Accounting Firm determines that the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet was not
prepared in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or contains mathematical error, the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be the Final Closing Balance Sheet.
DuPont and Buyer shall mutually select the Independent Accounting Firm, but if
DuPont and Buyer cannot mutually agree on the identity of the Independent
Accounting Firm, then DuPont and Buyer shall each submit to the other party's
independent auditor the name of a national accounting firm other than
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
selected by lot from these two firms by the independent auditors of the two
parties. (If no national accounting firm shall be willing to serve as the
Independent Accounting Firm, then a nationally recognized (in the United States)
expert in public accounting shall be selected to serve as such, such selection
to be according to the above procedures.) Any expenses relating to the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of its services
pursuant to this Section 2.4(d)) shall be shared equally by DuPont and Buyer.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every reasonable
effort to perform its services within 30 days of submission of the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet to it and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after
such submission. The calculation of Final Net Assets shall then be prepared by
Buyer in accordance with the written determination of the


                                       31
<Page>

Independent Accounting Firm, and delivered to DuPont. DuPont and Buyer agree
that judgment may be entered upon the written determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which
such determination is to be enforced.

                  (e) The Purchase Price shall, subject to any increase pursuant
to Section 2.4(f), be equal to the Closing Purchase Price, (i) plus, if the
Final Net Assets exceed the Estimated Net Assets, then the amount of such
excess, or (ii) minus, if the Estimated Net Assets exceed the Final Net Assets,
then the amount of such excess (either such excess amount, the "FINAL CLOSING
ADJUSTMENT"). Buyer or DuPont, as the case may be, shall, within ten (10)
Business Days after the final determination of the Final Closing Balance Sheet
pursuant to Sections 2.4(c) and (d) hereof, make payment to the other by wire
transfer in immediately available funds of the amount of the Final Closing
Adjustment as determined pursuant to the preceding sentence, together with
interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at a floating rate
equal to the U.S. dollar prime rate per annum, as quoted by J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co., from time to time during such period. Such interest shall be calculated
based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed since the Closing
Date.

                  (f) The parties acknowledge that DuPont intends to cause all
Cash held by the Transferred Business Companies prior to the Closing to be
transferred to DuPont or one or more of the Retained Subsidiaries and that
DuPont shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that DuPont shall have no obligation to transfer Cash held by Pharma
Canada, but may transfer such Cash at its sole discretion. To the extent that
DuPont does not transfer some or all of the Cash of Pharma Canada prior to the
Closing, Buyer and DuPont agree that (i) Buyer will use reasonable best efforts
to effect the transfer of Cash from Pharma Canada to Buyer or any Affiliate of
Buyer at the lowest possible withholding tax cost to Buyer, and (ii) DuPont
shall reimburse Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for 50% of any Canada
withholding Taxes actually incurred by Buyer (calculated at the actual
applicable withholding tax rate, but not to exceed 5% for purposes of this
calculation) upon such transfer from Pharma Canada. In addition, to the extent
there is a legal impediment that prevents Cash held by Pharma Canada at the time
of the Closing from being distributed by Pharma Canada to Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer within 30 days of the Closing, DuPont shall reimburse Buyer for 50% of
the costs to Buyer of the delay in distributing such Cash (including without
limitation reasonable time value of money and cost of currency hedges to the
extent applicable), calculated up to the earlier of the date on which the
impediment to distribution no longer exists or December 31, 2002, and Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to minimize the costs resulting from the delay
in distributing such Cash. Any payments by DuPont under the preceding two
sentences of this Section 2.4(f) shall be made within 10 days


                                       32

of the receipt by DuPont of documentation from Buyer providing reasonable
evidence of the withholding taxes and or costs incurred by Buyer.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that any
Cash held by the Transferred Business Companies is not transferred to DuPont or
a Retained Subsidiary prior to the Closing, there shall be an upward adjustment
to the Closing Purchase Price in an amount equal to the amount of such
undistributed Cash. The amount of such adjustment shall be determined in
accordance with the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and, if disputed, the
Final Closing Balance Sheet, on the same time frame and in a manner analogous to
that applicable to the calculation of Preliminary Net Assets and Final Net
Assets, except that there shall be no minimum amount of such undistributed Cash
required as a precondition to making any such adjustment.

            2.5 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Closing Purchase Price shall
be allocated among the DPC Interests, DCI Shares, DPRL Shares, the DPL Shares,
the Controlled Foreign Subsidiary Shares and the Transferred Equipment and the
Transferred Assets to the extent required by reason of Section 754, Section
338(g) and/or Section 338(h)(10) elections having been made as agreed by DuPont
and Buyer (the "PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION SCHEDULE"), in accordance with Section
1060 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and in accordance with local law. The Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule shall be amended, as appropriate, as agreed by DuPont and Buyer from
time to time to take into account purchase price adjustments pursuant to Section
2.4 hereof, Section 8.4(d) hereof and otherwise. DuPont and Buyer hereby agree
that prior to Closing, they will agree to purchase price allocations to each of
the Controlled Foreign Subsidiaries, after taking into account additional due
diligence, Cash balances, estimated net income from April 30, 2001 through the
Closing, and other relevant factors, provided that such allocations shall be
within the ranges indicated on Schedule 2.5 hereto (unless DuPont and Buyer
shall mutually agree otherwise) and that such agreed upon allocations shall be
included in the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. The parties shall (i) timely
file all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and any
supplemental filings to reflect any revisions to the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule) required to be filed in connection with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, as amended, (ii) be bound by the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
and take no position inconsistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule,
as amended, for all Tax purposes (including, without limitation, in any audit or
judicial or administrative proceeding or otherwise), and (iii) prepare and file
all Tax Returns and determine all Taxes in a manner consistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule, as amended. Each of the parties shall notify the
other if it receives notice that any Tax Authority proposes any allocation
different from that set forth on the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as
amended.

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DUPONT

            DuPont hereby represents and warrants to Buyer that, except as set
forth in the Schedules to this Agreement delivered by DuPont with reference to
the specific Section of this Agreement so qualified:

            3.1 ORGANIZATION, ETC. Each of the Sellers and the Transferred
Business Companies is a corporation (or, in the case of DPC, a general
partnership) duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization (in the case of good standing to
the extent such concept is recognized in such jurisdiction). Each of the
Transferred Business Companies has all requisite power and authority to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its
property and assets. Each of the Transferred Business Companies is qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction in which ownership of property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, except where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of (a) the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of each of the Sellers and the Transferred Business
Companies (other than DPC) and (b) the partnership agreement of DPC, each as
presently in effect, have been made available to Buyer.

            3.2 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT, ETC. Each of the Sellers
and DPC has all requisite corporate or partnership power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and any other Related Agreements to which it
is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by the Board of Directors of each of the Sellers and DPC to the
extent party thereto. No other corporate or partnership proceedings on the part
of DuPont (and no action on the part of stockholders of DuPont) or any of its
Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
in accordance with their respective terms of this Agreement, the Related
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. This Agreement and the Related Agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, has been (or in the case of the
Related Agreements will be) duly and validly executed and delivered by each of
the Sellers and DPC to the extent party thereto and, assuming this Agreement and
such other agreements have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 or a Foreign Buyer Sub, as applicable, each of
this Agreement and such other agreements constitutes (or in the case of the
Related Agreements will constitute) a legal, valid and binding agreement


                                       34
<Page>

of the Sellers and DPC to the extent party thereto, enforceable against each
such company in accordance with its terms.

            3.3 CAPITALIZATION. (a) All of the authorized partnership interests
of DPC are owned 50% by DuPont and 50% by DPI. All of the DPC Interests are duly
authorized and validly issued. The authorized capital stock of DCI consists of
2,000 shares of common stock, of which 1,000 shares of common stock are issued
and outstanding. The authorized capital stock of DPRL consists of 40,000,000
shares of common stock, of which 13,489,604 shares of common stock are issued
and outstanding. The authorized capital stock of DPL consists of 12,000 shares

and outstanding DPC Interests, DCI Shares, DPRL Shares and DPL Shares are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of any
Encumbrances in respect thereto. Schedule 3.3 sets forth the name of each
Transferred Business Company, its jurisdiction of organization, the amount of
its authorized capital stock (or partnership interests), the amount of its
outstanding capital stock (or partnership interests) and the record owners of
such outstanding stock (or partnership interests). There are no outstanding (i)
securities convertible into or exchangeable for the capital stock of, or equity
or partnership interests in, any of the Transferred Business Companies, (ii)
options, warrants or other rights to purchase or subscribe for capital stock of,
or equity or partnership interests in, any of the Transferred Business
Companies, (iii) bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right
to vote on matters involving the Transferred Business Companies, or (iv)
Contracts or understandings of any kind, other than this Agreement, (A) relating
to the sale, issuance, transfer, repurchase, redemption, reacquisition or voting
of any capital stock of, or equity or partnership interests in, any of the
Transferred Business Companies, or of any such convertible or exchangeable
securities or any such options, warrants or rights, or (B) which provides the
economic equivalent of an equity ownership interest in a Transferred Business
Company pursuant to which, in any of the foregoing cases, any of the Transferred
Business Companies is subject or bound.

                  (b) Upon consummation of the Sale, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2
and the Foreign Buyer Subs, as the case may be, will own all of the issued and
outstanding DPC Interests, DCI Shares, DPRL Shares, DPL Shares and Foreign
Controlled Subsidiary Shares, free of any Encumbrances, other than Encumbrances
created by Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 or any of the Foreign Buyer Subs.

                  (c) Except for (i) their Subsidiaries set forth on Schedule
3.3(c) and (ii) the Excluded Assets, the Transferred Business Companies do not


                                       35

directly or indirectly own any capital stock of or other equity interests in any
corporation, partnership or other Person and none of the Transferred Business
Companies is a member of or participant in any partnership, joint venture or
similar Person. The Transferred Business Companies have good and valid title to
the capital stock of or other equity interests in the entities listed on
Schedule 3.3(c), in the amounts set forth on such Schedule, free and clear of
any Encumbrances.

            3.4 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO VIOLATIONS. Neither the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Sellers and DPC nor the
execution, delivery and performance of the Related Agreements by the Sellers and
DPC party thereto, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby by the Sellers and DPC, will (a) violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or partnership agreement (or other
comparable governing documents) of the Sellers or any Transferred Business
Company, (b) require any consent, waiver, approval, license, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to (collectively, the "GOVERNMENTAL

Trade Commission (the "FTC") and with the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) requirements of the EC Merger
Regulations or any other foreign Antitrust Laws and Laws regulating exchange or
currency controls and (iii) Governmental Filings that are not material, (c)
conflict with or give rise to any Encumbrance or material preferential purchase
rights, material rights of first refusal or similar material rights of any third
party or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration or any obligation of any of the
Sellers or any Transferred Business Company) or a loss of any material benefit
to which any of the Sellers or any Transferred Business Company is entitled
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Indebtedness,
government registration, Contract, Plan, permit or other instrument or
obligation, in each case which is material, to which any of the Sellers or any
Transferred Business Company is a party or by which any of the Sellers or any
Transferred Business Company or any of its respective material properties or
material Assets may be bound, or (d) assuming the making or obtaining of the
Governmental Filings referred to in clause (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above, conflict
with, give rise to a loss of benefit under or violate any Law applicable to any
of the Sellers or any Transferred Business Company or by which any of their

Effect.

            3.7 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW, PERMITS.

                  (a) The Transferred Business is not being conducted in
violation of any applicable Law, except such violations which individually or in
the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Transferred Business Companies have all governmental permits,
licenses, certificates, qualifications, registrations, approvals for their
products, other approvals and other similar authorizations necessary for the
conduct of their businesses as presently conducted and the ownership or current
use of the Transferred Assets (the "PERMITS") and are in compliance with the
terms of the Permits, except where the failure to have such a Permit or for any
non-compliance which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (b) The Transferred Business Companies hold all Permits
necessary as such activities are currently conducted to develop, manufacture,
distribute and sell the product known as Sustiva(TM) and are in compliance in
all material respects with the terms of such Permits. The NDA relating to such
product has been approved by, and none of DuPont or any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice in writing which has, or reasonably should have, led DuPont
or any such Subsidiary to believe that the NDA relating to such product is not
currently in good standing in all material respects with the FDA. To DuPont's
Knowledge, no condition or state of facts exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a violation of, or a material liability or default
under, any of the foregoing.

                  (c) (i) The Transferred Business, as conducted in the United
States, is conducted in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws in connection with the preparation and submission to the FDA of each of the
NDAs relating to the material products of the Transferred Business, and each of
the NDAs relating to the material products of the Transferred Business has been
approved by, and none of DuPont or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
notice in writing which has, or reasonably should have, led DuPont or any such
Subsidiary to believe that any of the NDAs relating to the material products of
the Transferred Business are not currently in good standing with the FDA. The
Transferred Business Companies (or their designated agents) have filed, or
caused to be filed, with the FDA all required notices, supplemental applications
and annual or other reports, including adverse experience reports, with respect
to each NDA relating to each material product of the Transferred Business
required to be filed by the NDA holder except when the failure to file such
notices, applications and reports would not have a material adverse effect with
respect to the continued good standing of any such product with the FDA. With
respect to the material products of the Transferred Business for which an NDA
has been approved by the FDA, the applicant and all Persons performing
operations covered by the application acted in material


                                       40
<Page>

compliance with 21 U.S.C. ss.ss.355 or 357, 21 C.F.R. Parts 314 or 430 et seq.,
respectively, and all terms and conditions of such application.

                        (ii) The Transferred Business, as conducted outside the
United States, is conducted in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws in connection with the preparation and submission to each
applicable Governmental Authority of each marketing authorization application or
its equivalent ("MAA"), amendment or variation or supplement to an MAA,
re-registration, safety report or necessary response relating to each material
product of the Transferred Business currently manufactured, marketed, promoted
or sold outside the United States, and, except for such failures as would not
have a material adverse effect on the continued good standing with the
applicable Governmental Authority of any such product, (A) each of the MAAs
relating to each such product of the Transferred Business has been approved by,
and (B) none of DuPont or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice in
writing which has, or reasonably should have, led DuPont or any such Subsidiary
to believe that any of the MAAs relating to such product of the Transferred
Business are not currently in good standing with, each applicable Governmental
Authority. The Transferred Business Companies (or their designated agents) have
filed with each applicable Governmental Authority all required notices,
supplemental applications and annual or other reports, including adverse
experience reports, with respect to each MAA required to be filed by the holder
of the MAA, relating to each such product of the Transferred Business except
when the failure to file such notices, applications and reports would not have a
material adverse effect on the continued good standing of such product with the
regulatory jurisdiction which issued the MAA. With respect to such material
products of the Transferred Business for which an MAA has been approved by the
applicable Governmental Authority, the applicant and all Persons performing
operations covered by the application acted in material compliance with
applicable Law and all terms and conditions of such application.

                        (iii) None of DuPont or any of its Affiliates have
received any notice since January 1, 1999, that any Governmental Authority
(including the FDA) has commenced, or, to their Knowledge, threatened to
initiate any action to withdraw any approval for a material product or to limit
the ability of the Transferred Business to manufacture (or to have manufactured
for it by a third party) any material product or to request the recall of any
material product of the Transferred Business, or commenced or, to their
Knowledge, threatened to initiate any action to enjoin production of such
products at any facility.

                        (iv) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, all manufacturing operations conducted by the
Transferred Business Companies (or by third parties on behalf of the Transferred


                                       41
<Page>

Business Companies) relating to the manufacturing of the products of the
Transferred Business are being conducted in compliance with Good Manufacturing
Practices, with appropriate industry standards in the country in which such
manufacturing is being conducted and with appropriate industry standards in each
country in which the Transferred Business Companies intend to market, promote or
sell such products.

                        (v) DuPont has made available to Buyer copies of (A) all
reports of inspection observations, (B) all establishment inspection reports and
(C) all warning letters as well as any other documents received by DuPont or any
of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 1999 from the FDA or any other Governmental
Authority relating to the products of the Transferred Business and/or arising
out of the conduct of the Transferred Business that in the case of clauses (A),
(B) and (C) (1) are in the possession of DuPont or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any of the Transferred Business Companies) and (2) assert a material
violation or material non-compliance with any applicable laws or regulatory
requirements (including those of the FDA).

            3.8 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as and to the extent
reflected in the Balance Sheet, none of the Transferred Business Companies had
at December 31, 2000 any Liabilities of a type required by GAAP to be reflected
on a combined balance sheet of the Transferred Business Companies or in the
notes thereto (it being deemed for the purpose of this Section 3.8 that each
Assumed Liability is a Liability of (and incurred by) a Transferred Business
Company). Since December 31, 2000, none of the Transferred Business Companies
has incurred any Liabilities required by GAAP to be reflected on a combined
balance sheet of the Transferred Business Companies or in the notes thereto
except for such Liabilities which were incurred by a Transferred Business
Company since December 31, 2000, in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice or as expressly permitted by this Agreement. The Assumed
Liabilities do not include any Liabilities that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            3.9 LITIGATION. There is no action, suit or proceeding pending, or,
to the Knowledge of DuPont, action, suit or proceeding threatened, against a
Transferred Business Company (or which would reasonably be expected to result in
a Liability that would be an Assumed Liability), before any Governmental
Authority or arbitration tribunal which individually or in the aggregate would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.9 lists as
of the date of this Agreement all actions, suits or proceedings pending, or to
the Knowledge of DuPont, threatened, which involve a claim for damages or other
monetary relief against a Transferred Business Company (or which specifically
relate to, or involve, a Transferred Business Company or Transferred Asset other
than actions, suits or


                                       42
<Page>

proceedings pending against Buyer or its Affiliates) or which would reasonably
be expected to result in a Liability that would be an Assumed Liability in any
instance in excess of $5 million (or if no damages or other monetary relief are

or to which any of the Transferred Business Companies or an ERISA Affiliate is

                  (c) No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA, or

any of the Transferred Business Companies or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring
any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due).

                  (d) No Transferred Business Plan which is subject to Title IV
of ERISA ("TRANSFERRED BUSINESS TITLE IV PLAN") is, or within the five (5) year
period


                                       45
<Page>

preceding the date of their Agreement was, a "multiemployer pension plan," as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, nor is any Transferred Business Title IV Plan
a plan described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

                  (e) Each Transferred Business Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, and with
respect to each Transferred Business Plan, all contributions, premiums and
reserves required as of the Closing Date have been paid by, or in the case of
reserves, have been properly reflected on the books of, the appropriate
Transferred Business Company.

                  (f) Each Transferred Business Plan intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, or to have tax-favored status
under applicable Law, is so qualified, or tax-favored, and the trusts maintained
thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code or
applicable Law.

                  (g) With respect to each Transferred Business Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or to the minimum funding requirements of Section

(i) there is no event or condition existing (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) that could be deemed to be a "reportable event"

requirement has not been waived, and no condition exists that could subject any
of the Transferred Business Companies to a fine under Section 4071 of ERISA;
(ii) no amendment has occurred that has required or could require any of the
Transferred Business Companies to provide security to such Transferred Business
Plan under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of ERISA; (iii) no
documentation or other information has been or is currently required to be
provided to the PBGC pursuant to Section 4011 of ERISA; (iv) no transaction has
occurred and no condition exists with respect to such Transferred Business Plan
that has subjected or shall likely subject any of the Transferred Business
Companies to liability under Section 4069 of ERISA; (v) no event has occurred
and no condition exists that could subject any of the Transferred Business
Companies or any ERISA Affiliate to any material Tax under Chapter 43 of the
Code or to a material fine under Section 502(c) of ERISA; and (vi) none of the
Transferred Business Companies or any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction, as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA.

                  (h) No Transferred Business Plan provides medical, surgical,
hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for
employees or former employees of any Transferred Business Company for periods
extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than
(i) coverage


                                       46
<Page>

mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan," or
(iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the current or former employee
(or his beneficiary). Schedule 3.11(h) discloses, as of December 31, 2000, the
amount of unfunded liabilities for retiree medical, dental and life insurance
benefits (and any other post-retirement benefits other than pensions) arising
under such plan, broken down with respect to current employees and former
employees of the Transferred Business Companies, as of December 31, 2000, in
accordance with FAS 106, and no amendment to such plan since such date has
increased such liabilities. The valuation in Schedule 3.11(h) discloses whether
it takes into account contributions of the current employees and former
employees of the Transferred Business Companies and all assumptions used in
calculating such valuation. In addition, Schedule 3.11(h) discloses the number
of Transferred Employees who are currently eligible or may become eligible to
receive such post-retirement benefits within three (3) years of the date of this
Agreement.

                  (i) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i)
entitle any current or former employee or officer of any of the Transferred
Business Companies or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount, of compensation due any such employee or officer.

                  (j) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
DuPont, there are (i) no pending or threatened claims, or facts that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such claims, by or on behalf of any
Transferred Business Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such
Transferred Business Plan, or otherwise involving any such Transferred Business
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) or (ii) no matters pending (other
than routine qualification determination filings) with respect to any of the
Transferred Business Plans before any Governmental Authority, which claims or
pending matters could give rise to Losses that in the aggregate would exceed
$2,000,000.

                  (k) As of the date of this Agreement, there has been no
amendment to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by
DPC or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Transferred Business Plan which would increase materially
the expense of maintaining such Transferred Business Plan above the level of the
expense incurred in respect thereof for the 12 months ended as of the date of
the DPC Financial Statements.

                  (l) To the Knowledge of DuPont, there is no leased employee,
as such term is defined in Section 414(n) of the Code, who must be taken into
account for the requirements of Section 414(n)(3) of the Code who has not been
so taken into account. To the Knowledge of DuPont, each person providing
services to any of the Transferred Business Companies as an independent
contractor has been properly classified as such.

                  (m) There is no voluntary employees' beneficiary association,
within the meaning of Sections 501(c)(9) and 505, or rabbi trust, within the

within the meaning of Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, or
applicable Law, and there is no action, suit or legal, administrative,
arbitration, grievance or other proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
DuPont, threatened, or, to the Knowledge of DuPont, any investigation pending or
threatened against any of the Transferred Business Companies relating to any
thereof, and, to the Knowledge of DuPont, no basis exists for any such action,
suit or legal, administrative, arbitration, grievance or other proceeding or
governmental investigation.

                  (p) None of the Transferred Business Companies is party to any
collective bargaining, union or labor agreement. There is no labor strike,
dispute, slowdown or stoppage actually pending or, to the Knowledge of DuPont,
threatened against any of the Transferred Business Companies, and no Transferred
Employee is a member of or represented by any labor union and, to the Knowledge
of DuPont, there are no attempts of whatever kind and nature being made to
organize any such Transferred Employees. No certification or decertification is
pending or was filed within twelve (12) months preceding the date of this
Agreement respecting any Transferred Employee and, to the Knowledge of DuPont,
no certification or decertification petition is being or was circulated among
the Transferred Employees within the twelve (12) months preceding the date of
this Agreement. No agreement, arbitration or court decision, decree or order or

Agreement. There are no charges, administrative proceedings or formal complaints
of discrimination (including but no limited to discrimination based upon sex,
age, marital status, race, national origin, sexual preference, handicap or
veteran status) pending or, to the Knowledge of DuPont, threatened, or to the
Knowledge of DuPont, any investigation pending or threatened before the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any Governmental Authority. There have been
no audits of the equal employment opportunity practices of any of the
Transferred Business Companies and, to the Knowledge of DuPont, no basis for any
such claim exists. With respect to the items set forth on Schedule 3.11(q), each
of the following is true: (i) as of the date of this Agreement, none of the
Transferred Business Companies is a defendant in any action filed, or to the
Knowledge of DuPont threatened to be filed, by a class under the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure 23, or comparable state law, under any Federal, state or
local statute governing employment, and (ii) the aggregate amount of damages of
all the items set forth on Schedule 3.11(q) will not exceed $1,000,000
(excluding the matter identified on such schedule with an asterisk).

                  (r) (i) Other than the DuPont UK Plan, there are no defined
benefit pension plans, or such other plans required to be funded under
applicable Law, providing any benefit to any Transferred Employee in the United
Kingdom, Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland and pursuant to which any
of the Transferred Business Companies would have any liability. The DuPont UK
Plan is an exempt approved scheme and a contracted-out scheme, and DuPont is
named in a contracting-out certificate in relation to the DuPont UK Plan.

                        (ii) Other than the DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company
      Pension and Retirement Plan (Puerto Rico), there are no defined benefit
      pension plans, or such other plans required to be funded under applicable
      Law, providing any benefit to any Transferred Employee in Puerto Rico and
      pursuant to which any of the Transferred Business Companies could have any
      liability.

                        (iii) Other than the DuPont Pharma, Inc.

      or such other plans required to be funded under applicable Law, providing
      any benefit to any Transferred Employee in Canada and pursuant to which

      December 31, 2000, the projected benefit obligation of the DuPont Pharma,
      Inc. Non-Contributory Pension Plan on a FAS 87 basis did not exceed the
      fair market value of such Plan's assets by an amount equal to $1,500,000
      or more.

      liability.

                        (v) Other than the Company Agreement G-14/88, there are

                        (vi) Other than the Pension Plan/Life Insurance (Fortis
      AG) (the "BELGIAN PENSION PLAN"), there are no defined benefit pension
      plans, or such other plans required to be funded or for which a reserve
      must be established on the books of the plan sponsor under applicable Law,
      providing any benefit to any Transferred Employee in Belgium and pursuant
      to which any of the Transferred Business Companies could have any
      liability. Liabilities under the Belgian Pension Plan, calculated on a
      projected benefit obligation basis, do not exceed the fair market value of
      the assets of such plan by an amount equal to $200,000 or more.

                        (vii) There is no defined benefit pension plan, or such
      other plan required to be funded or for which a reserve must be

unfunded liabilities pursuant to FAS 87, and the assumptions used thereunder, as

                  (t) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not
result in the acquisition of assets from DuPont that have a total fair market
value equal to or more than one-third of the total fair market value of all
assets of DuPont, as a "corporation" (within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
Code) immediately prior to such "acquisition" (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder).

Transferred Business Companies are in compliance with all applicable

            3.13 REAL PROPERTY.

                  (a) Schedule 3.13(a) contains a complete and correct list of
all Owned Real Property. DPC or one of the other Transferred Business Companies
has (and upon the Closing will have) good and valid title in fee simple to the

has any right to use, occupy or lease the Owned Real Property.

                  (b) Schedule 3.13(b) contains a complete and correct list of
all Leased Real Property. True, correct and complete copies of all Leases
relating to the Leased Real Property have heretofore been delivered by DuPont to
Buyer. All such Leases are valid, binding and in full force and effect and are
enforceable by the lessee thereunder and grant such lessee the exclusive right
to use and occupy the premises. DPC or one of the other Transferred Business
Companies has quiet possession of the leasehold estate or other interest created

of the Transferred Business complies in all material respects with all material
instruments of record or material agreements affecting the Real Property.

                  (d) To the Knowledge of DuPont, (i) no certificate, permit or
license from any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over any of the Real
Property or any agreement, easement or other right which is necessary to permit
the lawful use and operation of the buildings and improvements on any of the
Real Property or which is necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of
all driveways, roads and other means of egress and ingress to and from any of
the Real Property has not been obtained or is not in full force and effect, and
there is no pending threat of modification or cancellation of any of the same,
which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii)
there is no written notice issued by any Governmental Authority of any violation
of any federal, state or municipal law, ordinance, order, regulation or
requirement that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Real Property shall be transferred to Buyer (by virtue of its acquisition of
the Transferred Business Companies) in its "AS IS" condition on the Closing
Date, subject to all latent and patent defects (whether physical, financial or
legal, but including only the title defects, if any, set forth on Schedule
1.1(i) hereto), based solely on Buyer's own inspection, analysis and evaluation
of the Real Property and not in reliance on any records or other


                                       52
<Page>

information obtained from DuPont or on DuPont's behalf, other than the title
reports referenced on Schedule 1.1(i) hereto. Each of Buyer, Buyer Sub 1 and
Buyer Sub 2 acknowledges that it is not relying on any statement or
representation that has been made or that in the future may be made by DuPont or
any of DuPont's employees, agents, attorneys or representatives concerning the
condition of the Real Property (whether relating to physical conditions,
operation, performance, legal matters or title matters (other than title matters
relating to any Real Property for which a title report has not been obtained as
set forth on Schedule 1.1(i) hereto)).

                  (e) None of the Sellers or any of the Transferred Business
Companies has received any written notice that (i) any condemnation proceeding
is pending or threatened with respect to any Real Property or (ii) any material
zoning, building or similar law, code, ordinance, order or regulation is or will
be violated by the continued maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or
other improvements on any Real Property or by the continued maintenance,
operation or use of the parking areas.

            3.14 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. (a) Set forth in Schedule 3.14(a), for
all Intellectual Property that is owned (or in the case of clauses (v) and (vi)

relating to commercial products and compounds nominated for development pursuant
to which the Transferred Business Companies have rights to use Intellectual
Property of third parties (including DuPont and its other Subsidiaries) in the

                  (b) The Transferred Business Companies own or license from
third parties (including DuPont and its other Subsidiaries) or otherwise have
the right to use, as currently used, free and clear of all Encumbrances, all the

hereby will not impair any such rights in any material respect; PROVIDED that
the foregoing representations insofar as they relate to claims by or conflicts
with any third party (other than DuPont or any Subsidiary of DuPont) with
respect to such Intellectual Property are made to the Knowledge of DuPont
(except that, with respect to Sustiva, Coumadin, Sinemet,

ownership, validity, enforceability or use (including claims of actual or
potential infringement, dilution or misappropriation) of any of the material
Intellectual Property used in or necessary to the conduct of the Transferred
Business related to (i) Sustiva, (ii) any such other Intellectual Property as of
the date of this Agreement, or (iii) any such other Intellectual Property as of

pending or, to the Knowledge of DuPont, threatened, against any third party by
DuPont or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Business Companies)
regarding any actual or potential infringement, dilution, or misappropriation of

<Page>

following the Closing to record ownership or to record a license for any pending
or issued Patents or applied for or registered Trademarks owned by a Transferred
Business Company to ensure that Buyer will have record ownership (or recording
of license agreements) of such Intellectual Property, and (ii) at DuPont's
expense, DuPont will take all reasonable steps prior to the Closing and shall
continue following the Closing with those efforts commenced prior to the Closing
to correct any title discrepancies with respect to the properties listed on
Schedule 3.14(a) and to record ownership or to record a license for any pending
or issued Patents or applied for or registered Trademarks owned by a Transferred

Property; PROVIDED that in any event Buyer must make any request under this
Section 3.14(f) within one year, and DuPont shall have no further obligations
under this Section 3.14(f) three (3) years, after the Closing.

            3.15 ASSETS. DPC or one of the other Transferred Business Companies

Intellectual Property, or (iii) the Transferred Equipment). DuPont has good and
valid title to (or in the case of leased Assets, valid leasehold interests in)
the Transferred Equipment free and clear of all Encumbrances except Permitted
Encumbrances. Upon consummation of the Sale, Buyer will have acquired good and
valid title to the Transferred Equipment, free and clear of all Encumbrances,

Schedule 3.18 or Schedule 3.20 (the "TRANSFERRED CONTRACTS") is legal, valid,
binding and in full force and effect and is enforceable by the Transferred
Business Companies in accordance with its terms except to the extent such
enforceability may be limited by the bankruptcy, insolvency, or the Chapter 11
or similar reorganization of the other party thereto. DuPont and its Affiliates
have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed
by them under the Transferred Contracts and no event has occurred that would
render them (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both)
in breach in any material respect or default thereunder and, to DuPont's
Knowledge, no event has occurred that would render any other party to any such
Transferred Contract (with or without the lapse of time or the


                                       58
<Page>

giving of notice, or both) in breach in any material respect or default
thereunder as of the date of this Agreement or in a breach or default that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of DuPont nor any
of its Affiliates has received any written, or to DuPont's Knowledge, oral
notice of the intention of any party to terminate any such Transferred Contract
or that any party considers that DuPont or its Affiliates are in breach in any
material respect or default thereunder as of the date of this Agreement or in a
breach or default that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Complete and correct copies of all of such Transferred Contracts,
together with all modifications and amendments thereto, have been made available
to Buyer.

                  (c) Except for the Transferred Business Plans, there is no
Contract to which a Transferred Business Company is a party or by which a
Transferred Asset is bound or an Assumed Liability arises that prior to Closing
requires any action or omission by DuPont or an Affiliate of DuPont that is not
in the ordinary and usual course of the Transferred Business consistent with
past practice or that would adversely impact in any material respect the ability
of DuPont or an Affiliate of DuPont prior to Closing to preserve intact its
business organizations and relationships with third parties and to keep
available the services of their present officers and employees to the extent
related to the Transferred Business.

            3.19 SHARED SERVICES. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.19 and
except for the services to be provided under the Related Agreements and the
DuPont Marks (the use of which shall be phased out by the Transferred Business
Companies pursuant to Section 5.7), (a) DuPont and its Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Business Companies) do not provide any material support services
to the Transferred Business Companies and (b) DuPont and its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Business Companies), on the one hand, and the Transferred
Business Companies, on the other hand, do not share any material Assets which
are used in, held for use in, or necessary for, the Transferred Business (other
than (i) Buyer Shared Know-how and DuPont Shared Know-how and (ii) Real Estate
and certain related services as expressly contemplated by the Leases and Site
Services Agreements).

            3.20 AGREEMENTS RESTRICTING AFFILIATES. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.20, there is no Contract that constitutes a Transferred Asset or
under which an Assumed Liability arises, or to which a Transferred Asset or
Assumed Liability is subject or bound, that would limit or restrict in any
manner whatsoever the conduct or operation of the business of Buyer and its
Affiliates (other than the


                                       59
<Page>

Transferred Business Companies) after the Closing (other than confidentiality
and non-disclosure agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business).

it is a party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. This Agreement and the Related Agreements to which Buyer is a party
have been (or in the case of the Related Agreements, will be) duly and validly
executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming this Agreement and such other
agreements have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by all of the other

Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 or any of the Foreign Buyer Subs is a party nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by Buyer,
Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 and the Foreign Buyer Subs will (a) violate any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer, Buyer Sub 1,
Buyer Sub 2 or any of


                                       60
<Page>

the Foreign Buyer Subs, (b) require any consent, waiver, approval, authorization

except for (i) filings with the FTC and the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) requirements of the EC Merger
Regulations or any other foreign Antitrust Laws and Laws regulating exchange or
currency controls and (iii) such consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations,
permits, filings or notifications which, if not obtained or made, would not, in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect,
(c) give rise to any material preferential purchase rights, material rights of
first refusal or similar material rights of any third party or result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration or any obligation to repay) or a loss of any benefit to which
Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 or any of the Foreign Buyer Subs is entitled
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Indebtedness, mortgage,
note, bond, Encumbrance, license, government registration, Contract, Lease,
franchise, permit, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Buyer is
a party or by which Buyer or any of its properties or Assets may be bound,
except such violations, breaches and defaults which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (d) violate any Law
applicable to Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 or any of the Foreign Buyer Subs
or by which any of its properties or Assets may be bound, except such violations
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

            4.4 BROKERS AND FINDERS. None of Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 or
any of the Foreign Buyer Subs or any of their officers, directors or employees
has employed any investment banker, broker or finder or incurred any Liability
for any investment banking fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which DuPont
or any Retained Subsidiary or, in the event the Closing does not occur, any
Transferred Business Company, has or could have any Liability.

            4.5 FINANCING. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer, Buyer Sub 1,
Buyer Sub 2 and the Foreign Buyer Subs have access to, and as of the Closing
Buyer will have, sufficient funds necessary to (a) pay the Purchase Price, and
(b) pay all of their fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            4.6 SECURITIES ACT. Buyer, Buyer Sub 1, Buyer Sub 2 and the Foreign
Buyer Subs are acquiring the DPC Interests, the DCI Shares, the DPRL Shares, the
DPL Shares and the Controlled Foreign Subsidiary Shares solely for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable
foreign


                                       61
<Page>

securities laws. Buyer acknowledges that the DPC Interests, the DCI
Shares, the DPRL Shares, the DPL Shares and the Controlled Foreign Subsidiary
Shares being acquired by it and its Subsidiaries are not registered under the
Securities Act, any applicable state securities law or any applicable foreign
securities laws, and that such DPC Interests, DCI Shares, DPRL Shares, DPL

required by applicable Law or any Contract to which a Transferred Business
Company is a party or by which a Transferred Asset is bound or any Transferred
Business Plan, (iii) with the consent of Buyer or (iv) as set forth on Schedule

      restricted stock or other benefit plan or arrangement covering any of its
      directors, officers or employees, or (v) materially increase compensation,
      bonus or other benefits payable to any of its directors or officers;

                        (6) incur, except in the ordinary course of business
      consistent with past practices, any Indebtedness or


                                       63

      Encumbrance on any Transferred Assets, except for Permitted Encumbrances;

                        (7) make any capital expenditure except as reflected in

      of which has been furnished to Buyer) and except for expenditures not in
      excess of $10 million in the aggregate;

                        (8) settle or agree to settle any DPC Action (excluding
      any Action related to Taxes) which settlements, in the aggregate, would be
      in excess of $10 million or which would impose any injunctive, equitable
      or other non-monetary relief or remedy which in any case impacts in any
      material respect the Transferred Business or in any respect the business
      of Buyer and its Affiliates, other than the Transferred Business
      Companies;

                        (9) issue or sell any new debt securities, incur any
      long-term Indebtedness or enter into any new credit facility;

                        (10) merge or consolidate with any other Person or
      acquire any other Person or a business, division or product line of any
      other Person (except as provided for in this Agreement);

                        (11) enter into, extend, renew or terminate (i) any
      Contract of the type described in Section 3.18(a)(iii), (ii) any Contract
      of the type described in Section 3.18(a)(vi)(B) (other than in the
      ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), (iii) any
      Contract of the type set forth in Schedule 5.20(a)(i)(A) or 5.20(a)(ii)(A)
      or a DuPont Merck Agreement (except for the termination of the License and
      Services Agreement, dated January 1, 1991, referred to in Schedule
      5.20(b)), except to the extent that any such extension, renewal or
      termination does not result in any additional liability to Buyer or any of
      the Transferred Business Companies or (iv) any other Contract other than
      in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

                        (12) except as set forth in Section 5.1(c) and except

      other distribution to its stockholders or other equity holders, redeem or
      otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or other equity
      interests or issue, sell or otherwise dispose of any capital stock or
      other equity interests or any option, warrant or other similar


                                       64
<Page>

      right or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such
      securities above;

                        (13) except as set forth in Section 5.1(c) and except
      for any Excluded Assets, pay, loan or advance any amount to, or sell,
      transfer or lease any of its assets to, or enter into any Contract with,
      or make any payments to or on behalf of DuPont or any of its Affiliates
      (other than the Transferred Business Companies);

                        (14) settle or compromise any material Tax liability or
      make or change any material Tax election; or

                        (15) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

                  (c) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
prior to the Closing, each of the Transferred Business Companies will be
permitted to (A) declare and pay dividends and distributions of, or otherwise
transfer, to DuPont or any Subsidiary thereof (i) Cash, (ii) any Excluded
Assets, and (iii) any DuPont Books and Records.

                  (d) Between the date of this Agreement and the date of the
Closing, DuPont shall cause each of the Transferred Business Companies not to
sell, distribute or promote sales of its products in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to result in "trade loading" or otherwise in a material
increase in the inventory levels, taken in the aggregate, of products of the
Transferred Business held by distributors of such products. Any such conduct by
a Transferred Business Company shall be deemed to not be in all material
respects in the ordinary and usual course of business of the Transferred
Business or the Transferred Business Companies. DuPont and its Affiliates shall
use their reasonable best efforts after execution of this Agreement and prior to
the Closing to comply with the plan to reduce the amount of inventory of
finished goods of the Transferred Business Companies consistent with the
inventory levels set forth in Schedule 5.1(d).

            5.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing, DuPont will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, give Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access to the DPC Books and Records and to such
personnel, offices and other facilities and properties and Assets of the
Transferred Business Companies and to furnish such other information in respect
of the operation of the Transferred Business as Buyer may reasonably request;
PROVIDED, that all requests for access pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
made in writing and shall be directed to and coordinated with the Chief
Financial Officer of DPC or such person or


                                       65
<Page>

persons as he shall designate; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that any such access shall be
conducted at a reasonable time, upon reasonable advance notice to DuPont, and in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any
business conducted by any Transferred Business Companies. In addition, during
such period, DuPont and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts
to allow Buyer and its Representatives to communicate with, and to review all
work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the course of its audit or review of the DPC
Financial Statements, and such access shall be provided promptly after request
by Buyer and/or its Representatives; PROVIDED, that the foregoing shall be
subject to professional liability standards and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
policy, which may include, without limitation, the requirement that Buyer and
its Representatives sign an "indemnification letter" in the form generally used
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP prior to receiving access to any materials
prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. All such information and access shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the confidentiality agreement dated
January 30, 2001 between Buyer and DuPont (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither DuPont nor
its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Business Companies) shall be
required to disclose any information to Buyer or its Representatives if doing so
presents a significant risk of violating any Contract or Law to which DuPont or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which it is subject or which it
believes in good faith presents a significant risk, based on an opinion of
counsel (which can be given by inside counsel), of resulting in a loss of the
ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege; PROVIDED that the parties
hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information without resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of Privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be required
to provide any such information as and to the extent it relates to the Retained
Business, the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities.

            5.3 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.

                  (a) DuPont and Buyer will cooperate, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, with respect to the notices and filings to
be made in connection with the consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations
under Law required prior to or after the Closing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Any such notice prepared by any of the
Transferred Business Companies for the benefit of any employee shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(b),
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause
the Closing to occur on or prior to September 30, 2001 or as soon as possible
thereafter and obtain as promptly as practicable all material consents,
authorizations, approvals and waivers required in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Law,
including all state


                                       66
<Page>

property transfer laws and Environmental Laws, or any Contract, (ii) lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) effect all necessary notifications, or registrations and filings
including, but not limited to, the Required Filings and submissions of
information required by any Governmental Authority (including any such
notifications, registrations or filings required post-Closing), (iv) obtain as
promptly as practicable all material consents, authorizations, approvals and
waivers required in connection with all state property transfer laws, including
the receipt of a Letter of Non-Applicability ("LNA"), or its equivalent,
pursuant to the State of New Jersey's Industrial Site Recovery Act ("ISRA")
respecting all Transferred Assets at the Chambers Works facility in Deepwater,
NJ, and (v) effect the transfer of all Environmental Permits, without material
changes to the operating conditions or discharge limitations contained therein,
required for the operations of the Transferred Business and all the Transferred
Environmental Assets. Sellers will timely notify Buyer and give Buyer the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations with the relevant Governmental
Authorities with respect to the terms and conditions of any Environmental
Permits to be transferred. Alternatively, and where not prohibited by Law or the
terms of any Environmental Permit, the parties may execute an agreement
providing that some or all of the operations of the Transferred Business and the
Transferred Environmental Assets will be conducted after Closing, subject to the
same material operating conditions and discharge limitations, pursuant to
existing Permits held by DuPont, DPC or DPI, as applicable. Subject to the
provisions of Section 5.3(b), the parties hereto further covenant and agree,
with respect to any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order, decree, ruling, statute, rule, regulation or executive order that
would adversely affect the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, to respectively use their reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may
be.

                  (b) With respect to filings required under applicable
Antitrust Laws, each of the parties shall prepare and make, or cause to be made,
the Required Filings under the HSR Act within five (5) Business Days following
the execution of this Agreement and all other Required Filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws within twenty (20) Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement and thereafter use reasonable best efforts to certify as soon as
practicable its substantial compliance with any requests for additional
information or documentary materials in connection therewith. Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Antitrust Laws by any Governmental Authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over
enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Laws (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL ANTITRUST
ENTITY") and shall take such action as may be required to (i) avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution, modification or suspension of, any injunction,
temporary


                                       67
<Page>

restraining order or other order that has the effect of preventing or delaying
the consummation of any of such transactions by any domestic or foreign court or
similar tribunal in any suit brought by a Governmental Antitrust Authority or by
a private party challenging the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any Antitrust Laws, or (ii) to resolve any objections of any Government
Antitrust Entity in a manner and at a time that would allow the Closing to occur
prior to the Outside Date. Except as qualified by the following sentence,
neither the taking of any action that Buyer is required to take pursuant to this
Section 5.3(b) nor the entry by a court, in any suit brought by a private party
or Governmental Antitrust Entity challenging the transactions contemplated
hereby as violative of any Antitrust Laws, of an order or decree permitting the
transactions contemplated hereby but requiring that any assets or businesses be
divested or held separate by Buyer, or that would otherwise limit Buyer's
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any assets or
businesses shall be deemed a failure to satisfy the conditions specified in
Section 7.2, and, notwithstanding such order or decree, Buyer shall still be
obligated to deliver the full amount of the Closing Purchase Price at the
Closing and the Final Closing Adjustment, if any, pursuant to Section 2.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3, under no
circumstances will Buyer be required to divest, hold separate or otherwise limit
Buyer's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
assets or businesses listed on Schedule 5.3(b) and any requirement to do so
would constitute a failure to satisfy the condition specified in Section 7.2(e).
In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this
Section 5.3(b) and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Section 5.3(b) shall govern. No action taken pursuant to this Section 5.3(b),
whether or not Buyer is required to take such action, shall be a basis for
indemnification pursuant to Article VIII.

                  (c) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any
written or substantive oral communication from any Governmental Antitrust Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party hereto or
any Affiliate thereof receives a request for information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with
the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request and to
provide the other party (and its counsel), upon request, advance drafts of all
presentations and filings in connection therewith. All substantive telephone
calls and meetings with a Governmental Antitrust Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall include Representatives of each of Buyer
and DuPont (except to the extent that the applicable Governmental Antitrust
Entity does not permit such inclusion).

            5.4 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to Section 5.3, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts before and after the Closing
Date to take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other party hereto in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of any of the parties hereto; (ii) to the extent
consistent with the obligations of the parties set forth in Section 5.3, the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the performance of the obligations
hereunder; and (iii) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the
taking of such other actions, as the other party hereto may reasonably require
in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

            5.5 INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND ARRANGEMENTS. (a) Except as expressly
modified by a Related Agreement and except for the agreements set forth on
Schedule 5.5 hereto, all intercompany arrangements and agreements, whether
written or oral, providing goods, services or joint activities between DuPont or
any of the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the Transferred
Business Companies, on the other hand, shall be terminated and of no further
force and effect after the Closing. Effective upon the Closing, all outstanding
intercompany accounts, whether payables or receivables, between DuPont or any of
the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the Transferred Business
Companies, on the other hand, shall be cancelled and of no further force and
effect (it being understood that such cancellation shall not in any way affect
the Related Agreements or any amounts which may be payable pursuant to the
Related Agreements).

                  (b) Except to the extent provided to the contrary in Section
5.5(a), effective as of the Closing: (i) Buyer, on behalf of the Transferred
Business Companies, hereby releases DuPont and each of the Retained Subsidiaries
(and their respective officers, directors and employees, acting in their
capacity as such) from any Liability, obligation or responsibility to any of
them for any and all past actions or failures to take action prior to Closing,
including any actions which may be deemed to have been negligent or grossly
negligent, relating to or arising out of Contracts with DuPont or a Subsidiary
thereof or the operation or conduct of any businesses, Assets (including
activities performed thereat) or operations managed or operated by, or
operationally related to, directly or indirectly, to the Transferred Business or
the Retained Business, except for any Liability, obligation or responsibility
for any action or failure to take action in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement or for any fraudulent act or willful or intentional misconduct in
the operation or conduct of Transferred Business prior to the Closing Date; and
(ii) DuPont, for itself and on behalf of its Subsidiaries other than the


                                       69
<Page>

Transferred Business Companies, hereby releases the Transferred Business
Companies (and their respective officers, directors and employees, acting in
their capacity as such) from any Liability, obligation or responsibility to any
of them for any and all past actions or failures to take action prior to
Closing, including any actions which may be deemed to have been negligent or
grossly negligent, relating to or arising out of Contracts with DuPont or a
Subsidiary thereof or the operation or conduct of any businesses, Assets
(including activities performed thereat) or operations managed or operated by,
or operationally related to, directly or indirectly, the Transferred Business or
the Retained Business, except for any Liability, obligation or responsibility
for any fraudulent act or willful or intentional misconduct in the operation or
conduct of the Transferred Business or the Retained Business prior to the
Closing Date.

                  (c) Nothing set forth in this Section 5.5 shall limit or
otherwise affect any party's rights or obligations pursuant to, or contemplated
by, this Agreement and the Related Agreements, including any obligations
relating to indemnification and the assumption of Liabilities.

            5.6 PROVISION OF CORPORATE RECORDS. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, DuPont shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Buyer all DPC Books and Records then in the possession
of DuPont or any Retained Subsidiary, and Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to DuPont all DuPont
Books and Records then in the possession of any Transferred Business Company.
The foregoing shall be limited by the following specific provisions:

                   (i)  To the extent any document (including computer tape) can
      be subdivided without unreasonable effort into two portions, one of which
      constitutes a DPC Book and Record and the other of which constitutes a
      DuPont Book and Record, such document (including computer tape) shall be
      so sub-divided, and the original of the portion such document (including
      computer tape) which constitutes a DPC Book and Record shall be provided
      to Buyer (with a copy thereof provided to DuPont) and the original of the
      portion such document (including computer tape) which constitutes a DuPont
      Book and Record shall be provided to DuPont (with a copy thereof provided
      to Buyer).

                  (ii)  Neither party shall be required to conduct any
      company-wide search or investigation of files.


                                       70
<Page>

                 (iii)  "Commercially reasonable efforts" shall require, without
      limitation, deliveries of any such specific and discrete books and records
      requested in writing by either party.

                  (iv)  Each party may retain copies of books and records
      delivered to the other, subject to holding in confidence in accordance
      with Section 5.15 hereof information contained in such books and records.

                   (v)  Each party may refuse to furnish any Information if it
      believes in good faith that doing so presents, based on an opinion of
      counsel (which can be inside counsel), a significant risk of loss of the
      ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege; PROVIDED that the
      parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
      disclosure of such information without resulting in a loss of the ability
      to successfully assert a claim of privilege.

                  (vi)  Neither party shall be required to deliver to the other
      books and records or portions thereof which are subject to confidentiality
      agreements which would by their terms prohibit such delivery; PROVIDED,
      HOWEVER, if requested by the other party, such party shall use its
      commercially reasonable efforts to seek a waiver of such confidentiality
      restriction.

                 (vii)  DuPont may redact any Information covered by this
      Section 5.6 as and to the extent such Information relates to the Retained
      Business, the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities.

                (viii)  Buyer may redact any Information covered by this
      Section 5.6 as and to the extent such Information relates to Buyer's
      business, assets or liabilities other than the Transferred Business
      Companies, the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities.

            5.7 NAMES. Buyer agrees that it shall, and shall cause the
Transferred Business Companies to, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date and in any event within (x) 180 days (in the case of clause (a)(i)
below) and (y) one business day (in the case of clause (a)(ii) and (b) below)
following the Closing Date, (a) cease to (i) make any use of the name "DuPont,"
and any Trademarks related thereto or containing or comprising the foregoing,
including any name or mark confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof (the
"DUPONT MARKS"), and (ii)


                                       71
<Page>

hold itself out as having any affiliation with DuPont or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (b) in the case of any Transferred Business Company whose name
includes any DuPont Mark to change its corporate name to a name that does not
include any DuPont Mark and to make any necessary legal filings with the
appropriate Governmental Authority to effectuate such change. In furtherance
thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later than 180
days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all DuPont Marks from (or
otherwise not use) all materials owned by any of the Transferred Business
Companies, including, without limitation, any vehicles, business cards,
schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional
materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other materials or media
including any Internet usage or domain names that include the DuPont Marks;
PROVIDED that Buyer and the Transferred Business Companies may during such
180-day period continue to use any material containing a DuPont Mark to the
extent that it is not reasonably practicable to remove or cover up such DuPont
Mark. Notwithstanding the above, Buyer and the Transferred Business Companies
shall have a right to sell off existing inventory of products manufactured or
packaged by or for any of the Transferred Business Companies, which products
bear any DuPont Marks, for a period of one year; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer
and the Transferred Business Companies may use the DuPont Marks solely in
package inserts that have been packaged with products as of the Closing Date and
only until the applicable expiration date of each such respective product. Any
use of the DuPont Marks by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be in
reasonable conformity with the practices of DuPont as of the Closing Date and
shall be in a manner that is not intended to or is not reasonably likely to harm
or disparage DuPont or the reputation or goodwill of the DuPont Marks.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be construed to
require, or to permit, Buyer to take, or fail to take, any action which is in
violation of the rules and regulations of the Food and Drug Administration.

            5.8 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

                  (a) Upon the Closing, DuPont and the Retained Subsidiaries
shall receive from Buyer a grant of a world-wide, irrevocable immunity from suit
by Buyer and the Transferred Business Companies for the continued use after the
Closing Date of the Buyer Shared Know-how outside of the Pharmaceutical Field of
Use; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such immunity shall be limited to use by DuPont or
any of the Retained Subsidiaries of any such Buyer Shared Know-how for internal
research and development outside the Pharmaceutical Field of Use; and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that such immunity shall extend only to Buyer Shared Know-how in such
use by DuPont or any of the Retained Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date; and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that neither DuPont nor the Retained Subsidiaries shall have
the right to transfer or grant such immunity to a third party other than a third
party purchaser of


                                       72
<Page>

substantially all the business and Assets to which such immunities pertain. In
the event that a third party acquires (by operation of law or otherwise) all or
substantially all of the businesses or assets of Buyer to which such immunities
pertain, or acquires (by operation of law or otherwise) a 50% or greater voting
equity interest in Buyer, Buyer shall require such acquiring party to maintain
the immunities set forth in this Section 5.8(a).

                  (b) Upon the Closing, Buyer shall receive from DuPont a grant
of a world-wide, irrevocable immunity from suit by DuPont and the Retained
Subsidiaries for the continued use after the Closing Date of the DuPont Shared
Know-how inside of the Pharmaceutical Field of Use; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such
immunity shall be limited to use by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries of any such
DuPont Shared Know-how for internal research and development inside of the
Pharmaceutical Field of Use; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that such immunity shall
extend only to such DuPont Shared Know-how in such use by the Transferred
Business Companies as of the Closing Date; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Buyer
shall not have the right to transfer or grant such immunity to a third party
other than a third party purchaser of substantially all the business and Assets
to which such immunities pertain. In the event that a third party acquires (by
operation of law or otherwise) all or substantially all of the businesses or
assets of DuPont to which such immunities pertain, or acquires (by operation of
law or otherwise) a 50% or greater voting equity interest in DuPont, DuPont
shall require such acquiring party to maintain the immunities set forth in this
Section 5.8(b).

                  (c) Upon the Closing, Buyer shall receive from DuPont, in a
separate patent license agreement to be agreed upon by DuPont and Buyer, a grant
of a world-wide, royalty-free, exclusive, fully paid-up, freely sublicenseable,
perpetual license inside of the Pharmaceutical Field of Use (except that such
license shall be non-exclusive with respect to "biological products" as set
forth and conditioned within the definition of Pharmaceutical Field of Use) to
the rights related to:

                        (i) the Bile Acid Sequesterant Technology Patents, as
      set forth on Schedule 5.8(c)(i) hereto, subject to any license previously
      granted by DuPont or the Transferred Business Companies, provided that any
      such license granted after the date of this Agreement shall not be beyond
      the scope permitted under this paragraph (c); and

                        (ii) the rights related to the Roxifiban Process
      Patents, as set forth on Schedule 5.8(c)(ii) hereto.

                  (d) Upon the Closing, Buyer shall receive from DuPont, in a
separate patent license agreement to be agreed upon by DuPont and Buyer, a grant
of


                                       73
<Page>

a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, non-sublicenseable
(except to Affiliates, collaborators, or any other Person assisting Buyer in
research and development efforts or contract manufacturing), perpetual license

                  (k) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date,

Assets and Assumed Liabilities from DuPont to Buyer (including the transition of
any information technology systems) and to minimize any disruption to their
respective businesses that might result from the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the forgoing, at any time after the Closing, upon
reasonable written notice, DuPont and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other party and its employees, counsel, auditors and
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to such
Information and assistance relating to the Transferred Business Companies,
Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for
financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any
Tax Returns or the defense of any Tax Audit or any other requirement under any


                                       76
<Page>

applicable Law or regulation; PROVIDED that the provisions of Article VI shall
govern with respect to all Tax-related matters to the extent any provision in
Article VI is in conflict with this Section 5.9; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither DuPont nor
the Retained Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and neither Buyer nor its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be required to disclose any information
to the other or its Representatives if doing so presents a significant risk of
violating any Law or Contract to which DuPont or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyer or any its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, is a party or to which it is subject or which it believes in good faith
presents a significant risk of, based on an opinion of counsel (which can be
inside counsel), resulting in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a
claim of Privilege; PROVIDED that the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information without resulting in a
loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege. DuPont shall
not be required to provide any such information as and to the extent it relates
to the Retained Business, the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities.
Neither party shall be required by this Section 5.9 to take any action that
would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or unreasonably
disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Buyer, the business or
operations of any Transferred Business Company).

            5.10 PENDING LITIGATION. Following the Closing Date, (a) Buyer shall
have exclusive authority and control over the investigation, prosecution,
defense and appeal of all then pending Actions relating to or arising in
connection with the Transferred Business Companies, the Transferred Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities, including Actions with respect to the matters set forth
on Schedule 5.10(a) (each, a "DPC ACTION"), and may settle or compromise, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Action, without
the consent of DuPont except to the extent such settlement or compromise
involves an order, injunction or other equitable relief adversely affecting
DuPont or its Subsidiaries, and (b) DuPont shall have exclusive authority and
control over the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all then
pending Actions relating to or arising in connection with the Retained Business,
the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, including Actions with respect
to the matters set forth on Schedule 5.10(b) (each, a "DUPONT ACTION"), and may
settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to,
any such Action without the consent of Buyer except to the extent such
settlement or compromise involves an order, injunction or other equitable relief
adversely affecting Buyer or its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, that if (i) both DuPont
(or a Retained Subsidiary) and a Transferred Business Company are named as
parties to any DPC Action or DuPont Action, or (ii) such Action involves a claim
for which indemnification would be provided pursuant to Article VIII, DuPont,
any of the Retained Subsidiaries, Buyer, the Transferred Business Companies and
any of their Subsidiaries must comply with the provisions of Section 8.4 hereof
instead of this


                                       77
<Page>

Section 5.10. Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to have DuPont and any DuPont Indemnified Parties
removed as parties to any DPC Action in which they are named parties as soon as
is reasonably practicable, and DuPont shall, and shall cause the Retained
Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to have DPC and any Buyer
Indemnified Parties removed as parties to any DuPont Action in which they are
named parties as soon as is reasonably practicable.

            5.11 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

                  (a) CONTINUATION OF EMPLOYMENT. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause each Transferred Business Company to continue the
employment with such Transferred Business Company of all employees of the
applicable Transferred Business Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except
as may be required by applicable Law or employment agreement, if Buyer
terminates, or causes the applicable Transferred Business Company to terminate,
the employment of any Transferred Employee at any time on or after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall be responsible for the costs and consequences of any such
termination and shall indemnify and hold harmless the DuPont Indemnified Parties
against any Losses arising in connection therewith.

                  (b) COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. For a period of at least three
(3) years following the Closing Date, Buyer shall or shall cause, as applicable,
a Transferred Business Company or a Subsidiary of Buyer to offer compensation
(including base salary or wage rate, variable compensation and long-term
compensation) and benefits (including severance benefits) to the Transferred
Employees substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those provided to such
Transferred Employees in the year prior to the Closing Date; PROVIDED that any
employee benefits provided to such Transferred Employees may be provided under
existing or newly established employee benefit plans which may, in either case,
be employee benefit plans of Buyer, a Subsidiary of Buyer, or a Transferred
Business Company (any such employee benefit plan in which Transferred Employees
participate, the "APPLICABLE BUYER PLAN") and which may be modified at any time.

                  (c) CERTAIN LIABILITIES. As of the Closing Date, with respect
to all employee Liabilities or obligations not otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any such Liability or obligation
relating to or arising under any employee benefit or compensation plan,
agreement, arrangement, or program (excluding any stock option or other stock
based incentive plan, but including any stock based incentive awards which, by
their terms, are payable only in cash), as well as accrued wages and workers'
compensation, holiday, vacation and sick day benefits, (i) DuPont or an
appropriate Subsidiary of DuPont shall assume and


                                       78
<Page>

be solely responsible for all Liabilities and obligations whatsoever with
respect to Retained Employees and (ii) Buyer or an appropriate Transferred
Business Company shall assume and be solely responsible for all Liabilities and
obligations whatsoever with respect to Transferred Employees.

                  (d) PARTICIPATION AND SERVICE CREDIT.

                        (i) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Transferred Business Companies shall give Transferred Employees service credit
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, determination of the level of benefits and
benefit accrual under any Applicable Buyer Plan, except to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits, for service prior to the
Closing Date, to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
employee benefit plans of the Transferred Business Company immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

                        (ii) Buyer shall cause any pre-existing conditions,
restrictions or waiting periods under Applicable Buyer Plans to be waived to the
extent necessary to provide immediate coverage to each Transferred Employee who
was an eligible participant in the comparable Transferred Business Plan as of
the Closing Date. Any Applicable Buyer Plan which is a medical plan shall apply
any amounts paid under the medical plan of the applicable Transferred Business
Company by a Transferred Employee as deductibles and co-payments during the year
in which the Closing Date falls toward deductible and out-of-pocket limits of
the Applicable Buyer Plan which is a medical plan for the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs.

                  (e) CERTAIN PLANS AND AGREEMENTS. Buyer agrees to honor, and
to cause the Transferred Business Companies to honor, the severance agreements
and plans set forth on Schedule 5.11(e) hereto (the "LISTED AGREEMENTS"). DuPont
has previously provided to Buyer accurate annual base salaries and annual target
incentives, as of the date of this Agreement, of each individual who is a party
to a Listed Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that the Closing constitutes a "Change
in Control" for all purposes pursuant to the Listed Agreements. The Listed
Agreements shall not include any "supplemental agreement" listed on Schedule
3.11(i).

                  (f) PAID TIME OFF. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i)
cause the Transferred Business Companies to continue to provide the paid time
off entitlements set forth on Schedule 5.11(f) ("PTO") to the Transferred
Employees that are substantially equivalent to the PTO entitlements of the
Transferred Employees under the PTO policy of the applicable Transferred
Business Company immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) assume all
obligations to Transferred Employees with respect to accrued PTO.

                  (g) DUPONT'S 401(k) PLAN. As soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the DuPont
401(k) Plan shall have the right to elect to receive a distribution of all or a
portion of such employee's account balance in the DuPont 401(k) Plan (subject
to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the DuPont 401(k) Plan and
applicable Law). Buyer shall take any and all necessary action to cause the
trustee of a defined contribution plan of Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries, if
requested to do so by a Distributee, to accept the direct "roll over" of all or
a portion of any such distribution (including notes associated with the
outstanding balance of any loans of a Distributee under the DuPont 401(k) Plan)
from the DuPont 401(k) Plan.

                  (h) CARIBE DC PLAN. Unless otherwise agreed to by Buyer and
DuPont, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall establish or designate a
defined contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under applicable law
(together, the "BUYER CARIBE DC PLAN") to accept a transfer from the trustee of
the Caribe DC Plan in respect of account balances of Transferred Employees under
the Caribe DC Plan. DuPont shall, upon receipt of satisfactory written evidence
of the adoption of the Buyer Caribe Plan and its compliance with all applicable
laws, direct the trustee of the Caribe DC Plan to transfer, to the trustee of
the Buyer Caribe DC Plan, as of the Closing Date, in cash and/or notes
associated with the outstanding balance of any loans to Transferred Employees,
the cash value of the account balances under the Caribe DC Plan in respect of
Transferred Employees. Upon such transfer, the Buyer Caribe DC Plan shall assume
all liabilities for accrued benefits under the Caribe DC Plan in respect of
Transferred Employees and the Caribe DC Plan shall be relieved of all such
liabilities. The parties shall cooperate in the filing of the documents required
by the transfer of assets and liabilities described herein.

                  (i) NON-QUALIFIED PLANS. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause DPC to continue to maintain its Pension Restoration Plan, Retirement
Restoration Plan and Supplemental Retirement Income Plan with respect to
Transferred Employees. Buyer and DPC shall assume and be solely responsible for
the liabilities and obligations relating to the Transferred Employees who
participate in the DuPont 401(k) Restoration Plan.

                  (j) TRANSFERRED PENSION PLANS. With respect to each of the
Transferred Pension Plans, as of the Closing Date, DuPont shall have, or shall
have caused its Subsidiaries to have, conducted: (i) a fair market valuation of
the assets of each Transferred Pension Plan, and (ii) a valuation of the
aggregate liabilities of each Transferred Pension Plan in accordance with FAS 87
but using an 8.5% interest rate assumption and a 5.5% salary increase assumption
(collectively, the "SUBSTITUTED ASSUMPTIONS"). To the extent that the aggregate
liabilities of both Transferred Pension Plans on a projected benefit obligation
basis in accordance with FAS 87 and


                                       80
<Page>

the Substituted Assumptions exceed the aggregate fair market value of the assets
set aside in trust with respect to both Transferred Pension Plans (the
"UNDERFUNDING"), then as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, DuPont
shall make contributions to the respective Transferred Pension Plans equal to
the amount of such Underfunding in excess of $50 million.

                  (k) FOREIGN PENSION PLANS. (i) With respect to any pension
plan maintained or sponsored by DuPont or any Subsidiary of DuPont for the
benefit of foreign employees in which only Transferred Employees participate,
Buyer or an appropriate Transferred Business Company shall assume or retain sole
Liability for each such pension plan and no additional assets shall be
transferred by DuPont or any Subsidiary of DuPont to Buyer, DPC or such pension
plan with respect to any such pension plan.

                        (ii) (1) DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Section

            reasonably required for the calculation of the UK Transfer Amount

            documents and information in its possession and/or control that are
            reasonably required for the calculation of the UK Transfer Amount
            and covenants that all such documents and information shall be true
            complete and accurate in all material respects.

                                  (C) The UK Transfer Amount shall be calculated
            by DuPont's Actuary as being the value of the benefits prospectively
            payable under the DuPont UK Plan as at the Closing Date to and in
            respect of the Consenting Members and calculated on the basis of the
            Actuarial Assumptions, and adjusted in accordance with the Actuary's
            Letter.

                                  (D) DuPont shall cause DuPont's Actuary to
            calculate the unadjusted UK Transfer Amount as soon as practicable

            supplied to him to raise any objection to the calculation. The
            calculation shall be final and binding on DuPont and Buyer on the
            later of the agreement between DuPont's Actuary and Buyer's Actuary
            as to the UK Transfer Amount or, if a reference is made to an
            independent actuary under Section 5.11(k)(ii)(6), the date of his
            determination of the UK Transfer Amount.

            use reasonable efforts to cause the DuPont UK Plan to transfer, on
            the Due Payment Date, to the New Plan the UK Transfer Amount and the
            assets representing, as at the date of transfer, the additional
            voluntary contributions paid by the Consenting Members.

                                  (B) DuPont and Buyer shall, or shall cause
            their respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts


                                       83
<Page>

            to secure agreement between the DuPont UK Plan and the New Plan
            respectively as to the particular assets to be transferred
            representing the UK Transfer Amount. If Agreement is not reached by
            the Due Payment Date, the transfer shall be in cash. Any listed
            securities to be transferred shall be valued at the mid-market price
            at the close of business on the relevant stock exchange on the day
            before the date of transfer.

                                  (C) DuPont and Buyer shall respectively seek
            promptly from the Board of Inland Revenue approval to the transfer
            of assets from the DuPont UK Plan to the New Plan in respect of the
            Consenting Members.

                                  (D) If the total amount that has been actually
            transferred (if any) by the DuPont UK Plan to the New Plan on or
            before the Due Payment Date in respect of the Consenting Members is
            less than the UK Transfer Amount, DuPont shall, within 5 business
            days after the Due Payment Date, pay to Buyer or as it may direct,
            the amount of the underpayment (the "Shortfall"), together with
            interest at 2% above the base rate from time to time of National
            Westminster Bank plc calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days
            for the actual number of days elapsed accrued from the Due Payment
            Date up to and including the date of payment.

                                  (E) Immediately following any payment pursuant
            to Section 5.11(k)(ii)(5)(D), Buyer shall procure that an amount
            equal to the payment is contributed to the New Plan.

                              (6) DISPUTES. Any dispute between DuPont and Buyer
      or between DuPont's Actuary and Buyer's Actuary concerning any calculation
      or valuation of benefits under this Section 5.11(k) shall, in the absence
      of agreement between them within one month of the party concerned having
      notified the other in writing of the dispute, be referred to an
      independent actuary chosen by agreement between DuPont and Buyer or,
      failing agreement, appointed by the President for the time being of the
      Institute of Actuaries at the instance of either DuPont or Buyer. The
      independent actuary shall be instructed by DuPont and Buyer not to make a
      compromise determination but to adopt the submission of either DuPont (or
      DuPont's Actuary) or of Buyer (or Buyer's Actuary). The independent
      actuary shall determine the disputed matter as an expert and not as an
      arbitrator, and his decision shall be final and binding.


                                       84
<Page>

       The fees and expenses of the independent actuary and of such President
       shall be borne equally between the parties, except that the independent
       actuary shall have the power to determine, at the request of any party,
       that the fees and expenses shall be borne exclusively by the other
       parties or in such proportions as the actuary may determine and any such
       determination shall be final and binding.

                              (7) INDEMNITIES. Dupont covenants with Buyer to
      pay to Buyer on an after-Tax basis, so far as possible by way of reduction
      in the consideration payable under this Agreement:

                                  (A) an amount equal to any payment that any
            Transferred Business Company is or becomes liable to make to the
            DuPont UK Plan whether pursuant to section 75 of the UK Pensions Act
            1995, or otherwise, and any Liability or Loss that any Transferred
            Business Company incurs in relation to that payment;

                                  (B) an amount equal to any Liability or Loss
            that any Transferred Business Company incurs in relation to a claim
            made against that Transferred Business Company in relation to the
            exclusion prior to the Closing Date of an employee or former
            employee from an occupational pension scheme.

                  (l) EMPLOYMENT RELATED LIABILITIES. DPC shall assume Liability
with respect to any and all Losses incurred or suffered as a result of any claim
by any Transferred Employee which arises under Law (including, without
limitation, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of
1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act, the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, ERISA and all other statutes regulating
the terms and conditions of employment), under the common law or in equity
(including any claims for wrongful discharge or otherwise), or under any policy,
agreement, understanding or promise, written or oral, formal or informal,
between DuPont (but only with respect to the Listed Agreements) or DPC (or any
Subsidiary of DuPont (but only with respect to the Listed Agreements) or DPC)
and the Transferred Employee, whether arising out of actions, events or
omissions that occurred (or, in the case of omissions, failed to occur) prior
to, or after, the Closing Date. DuPont shall assume Liability with respect to
any Losses incurred or suffered as a result of any claim by any Retained
Employee which arises under Law (including, without limitation, Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act of 1990, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990, ERISA and all other statutes regulating the terms and conditions of

                                       85
<Page>
for wrongful discharge or otherwise), or under any policy, agreement,
understanding or promise, written or oral, formal or informal, between DuPont or
any of its Subsidiaries and the Retained Employee, whether arising out of
actions, events or omissions that occurred (or, in the case of omissions, failed
to occur) prior to, or after, the Closing Date.

                  (m) INDEMNIFICATION. All Liabilities retained, assumed or
indemnified by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall in each case be deemed
to be Assumed Liabilities, and all liabilities retained, assumed or indemnified
by DuPont pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall in each case be deemed to be
Retained Liabilities, and, in each case, shall be subject to the indemnification
provisions set forth in Section 8.4 of this Agreement.

                  (n) POST-RETIREMENT COVERAGE.

                        (i) POST-RETIREMENT HEALTH COVERAGE. For a three (3)
      year period commencing on the Closing Date (the "POST-RETIREMENT PERIOD"),
      Buyer shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Buyer to, provide
      post-retirement health coverage (excluding any post-retirement dental
      coverage) to each Transferred Employee (and eligible dependents) upon the
      termination of such Transferred Employee's employment; PROVIDED that such
      Transferred Employee otherwise satisfies the applicable age and/or service
      requirements. Such post-retirement health coverage shall be at least
      substantially equivalent (in terms of the eligibility requirements, scope
      of the post-retirement health coverage provided and the cost of such
      coverage to the Transferred Employees) to either (A) that provided under
      the applicable post-retirement health program in effect immediately prior
      to the Closing Date, recognizing additional age and service credit accrued
      with Buyer and/or a Subsidiary of Buyer after the Closing, or (B) that
      provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
      if Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer shall elect to provide post-retirement
      health coverage through an Applicable Buyer Plan pursuant to this Section
      5.11(n)(i)(B), Buyer or such Subsidiary of Buyer shall, for the duration
      of the Post-Retirement Period, waive any otherwise applicable company
      cost-sharing and life-time maximum limitations with respect to such
      post-retirement health coverage.

                        (ii) POST-RETIREMENT LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE. For the
      Post-Retirement Period, Buyer shall, or shall cause a Subsidiary of Buyer
      to, provide post-retirement life insurance coverage to each Transferred
      Employee upon the termination of such


                                       86
<Page>

      Transferred Employee's employment; PROVIDED that such Transferred Employee
      otherwise satisfies the applicable age and/or service requirements. Such
      post-retirement life insurance coverage shall be at least substantially
      equivalent (in terms of the eligibility requirements, amount of life
      insurance coverage provided and the cost of such coverage to the
      Transferred Employees) to either (A) that provided under the applicable
      post-retirement life insurance program in effect immediately prior to the
      Closing Date, or (B) that provided to similarly situated employees of
      Buyer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer shall
      elect to provide post-retirement life insurance coverage under an
      Applicable Buyer Plan pursuant to this Section 5.11(n)(ii)(B) and if such
      plan requires evidence of insurability in connection with the purchase of
      supplemental life insurance coverage, then Buyer or such Subsidiary of
      Buyer shall, for the duration of the Post-Retirement Period, cause such
      Applicable Buyer Plan to provide post-retirement life insurance coverage
      with terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to the
      post-retirement life insurance coverage provided under the applicable
      post-retirement life insurance program in effect immediately prior to the
      Closing Date with the exception of such requirement to provide evidence of
      insurability.

                  (o) DUPONT ASSUMED LIABILITIES. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, as of the Closing Date, DuPont shall assume all Liabilities
with respect to (i) providing long-term disability benefits to those Transferred
Employees who were in receipt of, or were eligible to receive, long-term
disability benefits from a Transferred Business Company immediately prior to the
Closing Date, excluding however any disability benefits paid or payable to a
Transferred Employee under a Transferred Pension Plan, (ii) providing
post-retirement welfare benefits (if any) to Transferred Employees (and eligible
dependents) whose employment had terminated prior to the Closing Date and (iii)
claims incurred during a period of a Transferred Employee's employment with
DuPont or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Business Companies)
arising solely from such employment relationship (except to the extent such
claims relate to Liabilities under any funded Transferred Business Plan).

                  (p) No later than forty-five (45) days after the date of this
Agreement, DuPont shall deliver to Buyer (i) a schedule setting forth the name,
current annual compensation rate (including bonus and commissions), title,
classification as executive officer, officer, director or senior manager,
department and current base salary rate of each Transferred Employee who is
employed by a Transferred Business Company as such date; (ii) a list of each
agreement between a Transferred Business Company and an independent contractor
which may not be


                                       87
<Page>

terminated without material penalty on less than six months notice; (iii) a list
of each material agreement between a Transferred Business Company and a
Transferred Employee (other than standard non-disclosure agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) or independent
contractor relating to proprietary processes, formulae or information; and (iv)
a detailed schedule of the PTO entitlements of Transferred Employees as of the
date of this Agreement, or as of such other time agreed to by DuPont and Buyer.

                  (q) FUTA; FICA. Buyer and DuPont shall, to the extent
possible, (i) treat Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer as a "successor employer" and
the applicable Transferred Business Company as a "predecessor," within the
meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to
Transferred Employees to be employed by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer for
purposes of Taxes imposed under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act
or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and (ii) cooperate
with each other to avoid the filing of more than one IRS Form W-2 with respect
to each such Transferred Employee for the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

                  (r) ACTIONS BY DUPONT. Any action required to be taken under
this Section 5.11 by DuPont may be taken by a Subsidiary of DuPont.

                  (s) MUTUAL COOPERATION. DuPont and Buyer shall (or shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries, third-party plan administrators and plan trustees
to) cooperate with each other prior to and following the Closing in effectuating
any communications, elections, access to populations, enrollments, payroll
transitions and such other actions as may be necessary or reasonable with
respect to participants in any Transferred Business Plan and/or employment,
consulting or such other agreement in connection with the actions contemplated
under Section 5.11 of this Agreement.

                  (t) AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE TRANSITIONAL SERVICES. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Buyer and DuPont shall enter
into a benefit transitional services agreement pursuant to which DuPont shall
provide to Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer, in exchange for payment (not to
exceed the actual cost of such services) from Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer,
services relating to the administration of certain Transferred Business Plans
(for a period not exceeding nine months, or such shorter period as requested by
Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer, during which period DuPont also provides payroll
services), payroll services (for a period not exceeding nine months, or such
shorter period as requested by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer) and such other
services reasonably requested by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer.

            5.12 POST-CLOSING ACCESS TO INFORMATION. From and after the Closing
Date, except as prohibited by applicable Law, DuPont and Buyer shall, subject to
compliance by the other and its Subsidiaries with the provisions of Section
5.15, afford to each other and to each other's Representatives reasonable access
and duplicating rights (with copying costs to be borne by the requesting party)
during normal business hours to all books and records, documents and other
information (collectively, "INFORMATION") within the knowledge, possession or
control of the other party or any DuPont Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified
Party solely to the extent relating to (a) in the case of Buyer, the Transferred
Business, Transferred Business Companies, Transferred Assets, Assumed
Liabilities or Transferred Employees and (b) in the case of DuPont, the Retained
Business, the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, insofar in each case
as such access is reasonably required by DuPont or Buyer or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and does not violate any applicable Law or any
confidentiality obligations applicable to DuPont or Buyer or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as the case may be (and shall use reasonable efforts
to cause persons or firms possessing relevant Information to give similar
access), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no party shall be required to disclose any
Information if it believes in good faith that doing so presents a significant
risk, based on an opinion of counsel (which can be inside counsel) of resulting
in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of Privilege; PROVIDED
that the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information without resulting in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of Privilege. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Information may be requested under this Section 5.12 for audit and
accounting purposes and in connection with Actions, as well as for purposes of
fulfilling disclosure and reporting obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this Section 5.12 shall not apply to Actions brought by one
party (or its Affiliates) to this Agreement against another party (or its
Affiliates) to this Agreement.

            5.13 PRODUCTION OF WITNESSES AND INDIVIDUALS. From and after the
Closing Date, DuPont and Buyer shall use and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to make available to each other, upon
written request, its officers, directors, employees and agents for fact finding,
consultation and interviews and as witnesses to the extent that any such person
may reasonably be required in connection with any Actions in which the
requesting party may from time to time be involved relating to the conduct of
the Transferred Business or the Retained Business. DuPont and Buyer agree to
reimburse each other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (other than officers'
or employees' salaries) incurred by the other in connection with providing
individuals and witnesses pursuant to this Section 5.13. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.13 shall not apply to Actions
brought by one party (or its Affiliates) to this Agreement against another party
(or its Affiliates) to this Agreement.

            5.14 RETENTION OF RECORDS. Except when a longer retention period is
otherwise required by Law or agreed to in writing, including as set forth in
Section 6.8, DuPont and the Transferred Business Companies and their
Subsidiaries shall retain, in accordance with their respective records control
schedule policy existing from time to time, all Information relating to the
Transferred Business and the Retained Business, respectively. The parties hereto
agree that upon written request from the other that certain Information relating
to the Transferred Business or the transactions contemplated hereby be retained
in connection with an Action, the parties shall use reasonable efforts to
preserve and not to destroy or dispose of such Information without the consent
of the requesting party.

            5.15 CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  (a) For a period of ten years from the Closing Date, DuPont
and Buyer shall hold and shall respectively cause their respective Affiliates
(including the Transferred Business Companies) to hold, and shall each cause
their respective Representatives to hold, in strict confidence and not to
disclose or release without the prior written consent of the other party, any
and all Confidential Information (as defined herein); PROVIDED, that the parties
may disclose, or may permit disclosure of, Confidential Information (i) to their
respective Representatives who have a need to know such information and are
informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the same
extent as is applicable to the parties hereto and in respect of whose failure to
comply with such obligations, DuPont or Buyer, as the case may be, will be
responsible or (ii) if the parties hereto, their Affiliates or their
Representatives are compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information by
judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of independent legal
counsel, by other requirements of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is
made pursuant to clause (ii) above, DuPont or Buyer, as the case may be, shall
promptly notify the other of the existence of such request or demand and shall
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective
order or other remedy, which both parties will cooperate in obtaining (each at
their own expense). In the event that such appropriate protective order or other
remedy is not obtained, the party who is required to disclose such Confidential
Information shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, only that portion of the
Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed. As used in
this Section 5.15, "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" shall mean all proprietary
technical, economic, environmental, operational, financial and/or other business
Information or material of one party which, prior to or following the Closing
Date, has been disclosed by DuPont or its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Business Companies), on the other
hand, in written, oral (including by recording), electronic, or visual form to,
or otherwise has come into the possession of, the other, in each case including
pursuant to the access


                                       90

provisions of Section 5.9 or Section 5.12 hereof or any other provision of this
Agreement or any Related Agreement or, (A) in the case of DuPont and its
Affiliates and Representatives, as a result of DuPont's direct or indirect
ownership of the Transferred Assets and Transferred Business Companies prior to
the Closing or (B) in the case of Buyer and the Transferred Business Companies,
as a result of DuPont's direct or indirect ownership of the Transferred Business
Companies or as a result of relationships, agreements and course of conduct of
the Transferred Business Companies with DuPont and its other Subsidiaries prior
to Closing, including, but not limited to, (a) ideas and concepts for existing
products, processes and services; (b) specifications for products, Equipment and
processes; (c) manufacturing and performance specifications and procedures; (d)
engineering drawings and graphs; (e) technical, research and engineering data;
(f) formulations and material specifications; (g) laboratory studies and
benchmark tests; (h) service and operation manuals; (i) quality assurance
policies, procedures and specifications; (j) evaluation and/or validation
studies; (k) pending patent applications; (l) all other know-how, methodology,
procedures, techniques and trade secrets related to research, engineering,
development and manufacturing; and (m) business information, including marketing
and development plans, forecasts, research and development agreements, and
customer and vendor information (except to the extent that such Information can
be shown to have been (1) in the public domain through no fault of such party or
its Affiliates (including, in the case of DuPont, any of the Retained
Subsidiaries or, in the case of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Business Companies)) or (2) lawfully acquired from other sources by
the party (or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Business Companies)) to
which it was furnished; PROVIDED, however, in the case of (2) that such sources
did not provide such Information in breach of any confidentiality or other legal
obligations). Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 5.15(a), with
respect to any Confidential Information first disclosed after the Closing Date
to DuPont or its Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, or Buyer or its
Affiliates or Representatives (including the Transferred Business Companies), on
the other hand, by the other party or its Affiliates or Representatives, the
obligations of this subsection shall terminate ten years after the date of the
first such disclosure of such Information.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
(i) DuPont and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Business Companies), on the other hand, shall be
deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to
Confidential Information if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less
than a reasonable degree of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for
their own similar Information and (ii) confidentiality obligations provided for
in any agreement between DuPont or any of its Affiliates, or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Business


                                       91
<Page>

Companies), on the one hand, and any employee of DuPont or any of its Affiliates
(or, prior to the Closing Date, any Transferred Business Company), or Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing Date the Transferred Business
Companies), on the other hand shall remain in full force and effect.
Confidential Information of DuPont and its Affiliates, on the one hand, or the
Transferred Business Companies, on the other hand, in the possession of and used
by the other as of the Closing Date may continue to be used by DuPont or its
Affiliates, or Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Business
Companies), as the case may be, in the operation of their businesses, so long as
the Confidential Information is maintained in confidence and not disclosed in
violation of this Agreement. Such continued right to use may not be transferred
to any third party (other than an Affiliate of a party hereto) unless the third
party purchases all or substantially all of the business and Assets in one
transaction or in a series of related transactions for which or in which the
relevant Confidential Information is used or employed.

                  (c) Immediately prior to the Closing, DuPont will request that
all confidential material provided to prospective purchasers of the Transferred
Business in connection with Sale Process (other than Buyer and its Subsidiaries)
be returned to DuPont or a Transferred Business Company or be destroyed.

            5.16 PRIVILEGED MATTERS.

                  (a) DuPont and Buyer agree that their respective rights and
obligations to maintain, preserve, assert or waive any or all privileges
belonging to either corporation with respect to the Transferred Business and the
Retained Business, including but not limited to the attorney-client and work
product privileges (collectively, "PRIVILEGES"), shall be governed by the
provisions of this Section 5.16. With respect to matters relating to the
Retained Business or to the Sale Process, DuPont shall have sole authority in
perpetuity to determine whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Business Companies) shall,
to their knowledge, take no action without the prior written consent of DuPont
that could result in any waiver of any Privilege that could be asserted by
DuPont under applicable Law and this Agreement. With respect to matters relating
to the Transferred Business (except as provided in the preceding sentence),
after the Closing, Buyer shall have sole authority in perpetuity to determine
whether to assert or waive any or all Privileges, and DuPont and its Affiliates
shall, to their knowledge, take no action after the Closing without the prior
written consent of Buyer that could result in any waiver of any Privilege that
could be asserted by Buyer under applicable Law and this Agreement. The rights
and obligations created by this Section 5.16 shall apply to all Information as
to which DuPont, Buyer, or the Transferred Business Companies would be entitled
to assert or has asserted a Privilege as provided above ("PRIVILEGED
INFORMATION"). Privileged Information of DuPont includes but is not


                                       92
<Page>

limited to (i) all Information regarding the Retained Business and all
Information of DuPont relating to the Sale Process, but which after the Closing
is in the possession of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Business Companies); (ii) all communications subject to a Privilege
occurring prior to the Closing between counsel for DuPont or any of the Retained
Subsidiaries (including in-house counsel and former in-house counsel who are
Transferred Employees) and any person who, at the time of the communication, was
an employee of DuPont or any of the Retained Subsidiaries, regardless of whether
such employee is or becomes an employee of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Business Companies); and (iii) all Information
generated, received or arising after the Closing Date that refers or relates to
Privileged Information generated, received or arising prior to the Closing Date.
Privileged Information of Buyer includes but is not limited to (i) any and all
Information generated prior to the Closing regarding the Transferred Business
but which after the Closing is in the possession of DuPont or any of the
Retained Subsidiaries (excluding Information of DuPont or its Subsidiaries
relating to the Sale Process); (ii) all communications subject to a Privilege
occurring prior to the Closing (excluding communications relating to the Sale
Process generated by DuPont or its Representatives) between counsel for the
Transferred Business Companies (including in-house counsel and former in-house
counsel who were employees of DuPont or the Retained Subsidiaries) and any
person who, at the time of the communication, was an employee of any of the

becomes an employee of DuPont or any of the Retained Subsidiaries; and (iii) all
Information generated, received or arising after the Closing Date that refers or
relates to Privileged Information generated, received or arising prior to the
Closing Date.

                  (b) Upon receipt by DuPont or its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Business Companies), as the case may be,
of any subpoena, discovery or other request from any third party that actually
or arguably calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Information of
the other or if DuPont or its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including the Transferred Business Companies), as the case may be, obtains
knowledge that any current or former employee of either DuPont or its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the other Transferred
Business Companies), has received any subpoena, discovery or other request from
any third party that actually or arguably calls for the production or disclosure
of Privileged Information of the other, DuPont or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall promptly notify the other of the existence of the request and shall
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to
assert any rights it may have under this Section 5.16 or otherwise to prevent
the production or disclosure of Privileged Information. DuPont or its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including DPC and the other
Transferred Business Companies), as the case may be, will not produce or
disclose to any third party any of the

the other has provided its express written consent to such production or
disclosure, or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction has entered an order not
subject to interlocutory appeal or review finding that the Information is not
entitled to protection from disclosure under any applicable privilege, doctrine
or rule.

                  (c) DuPont's transfer of DPC Books and Records and other
Information to Buyer, DuPont's agreement to permit Buyer to obtain Information
existing prior to the Closing, Buyer's and DPC's transfer of DuPont Books and

Buyer's and DPC's respective agreements, as set forth in Section 5.15 and this
Section 5.16, to maintain the confidentiality of such Information and to take
the steps provided herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may belong
to or be asserted by DuPont or Buyer, as the case may be. The access to
Information being granted pursuant to Section 5.9 and Section 5.12 hereof, the
agreement to provide witnesses and individuals pursuant to Section 5.13 hereof
and the disclosure to Buyer and DuPont of Privileged Information relating to the
Transferred Business or Retained Business pursuant to this Agreement shall not
be asserted by DuPont or Buyer to constitute, or otherwise deemed, a waiver of
any Privilege that has been or may be asserted under this Section 5.16 or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to reduce, minimize or
condition the rights granted to DuPont and Buyer in, or the obligations imposed
upon DuPont and Buyer by, this Section 5.16.

            5.17 MAIL AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS; ACCOUNTS.

                  (a) After the Closing Date, each of DuPont and its
Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries may receive mail, telegrams,
packages and other communications properly belonging to the other (or the
other's Subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date, each of
DuPont and Buyer authorizes the other and their respective Subsidiaries to
receive and open all mail, telegrams, packages and other communications received
by it and not unambiguously intended for the other party (or its Subsidiaries)
or any of the other party's (or its Subsidiaries') officers or directors, and to
retain the same to the extent that they relate to the business of the receiving
party or, to the extent that they do not relate to the business of the receiving
party, the receiving party shall promptly deliver such mail, telegrams, packages
or other communications (or, in case the same relate to both businesses, copies
thereof) to the other party. The provisions of this Section 5.17 are not
intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by either
DuPont or Buyer to permit the other to accept service of process on its behalf
and neither party is or shall be deemed to be the agent of the other for service
of process purposes.

                  (b) All payments and reimbursements received by DuPont or its
Subsidiaries in connection with or arising out of the Transferred Business, the
Transferred Assets or the Assumed Liabilities after the Closing shall be held by
such Person in trust for the benefit of Buyer and, immediately upon receipt by
such Person of any such payment or reimbursement, such Person shall pay over to
Buyer the amount of such payment or reimbursement, without right of set off.

                  (c) All payments and reimbursements received by Buyer or its
Subsidiaries in connection with or arising out of the Excluded Assets, Retained
Liabilities or Retained Business, after the Closing shall be held by such Person
in trust for the benefit of DuPont and, immediately upon receipt by such Person
of any such payment or reimbursement such person shall pay over to DuPont the
amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of set off.

            5.18 COMPLIANCE WITH WARN ACT AND SIMILAR STATUTES. Buyer agrees
that it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the "WARN ACT") and any
applicable state, local and foreign plant closing and layoff law as it relates
to any site of employment of the Transferred Business Companies. Buyer agrees
to, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
DuPont and the Retained Subsidiaries from and against any and all Losses which
DuPont and the Retained Subsidiaries may incur in connection with any Action or
claim of violation brought against DuPont and any of the Retained Subsidiaries
under the WARN Act or any state, local and foreign plant closing and layoff law,
which relate, in whole or in part, to actions taken by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date with regard to any site of employment of
the Transferred Business Companies or any of their respective operating units
within any site of employment of the Transferred Business.

            5.19 SHARED CONTRACTS. Subject to Section 5.20 below: (a) With
respect to Shared Contractual Liabilities pursuant to, under or relating to a
given Shared Contract, such Shared Contractual Liabilities shall be allocated
between DuPont and Buyer as follows:

                  (i) If a Liability is incurred exclusively in respect of a
      benefit received by DuPont or by DPC (or in the case of DuPont, the
      Retained Subsidiaries, or in the case of DPC, the Transferred Business
      Companies), the party receiving such benefit shall be responsible for such
      Liability.

                  (ii) If a Liability cannot be so allocated under clause (i),
      such Liability shall be allocated to DuPont or Buyer, as the


                                       95
<Page>

      case may be, based on the relative proportions of total benefit received
      (over the term of the Shared Contract, measured as of the date of the
      allocation) by such party or such party's Subsidiary under the relevant
      Shared Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of DuPont and Buyer
      shall be responsible for any or all Liabilities arising from its (or its
      Subsidiary's) breach of the relevant Shared Contract to which this Section
      5.19 otherwise pertains.

                  (b) If DuPont or any Retained Subsidiary, on the one hand, or
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including DPC), on the other hand, receives
any benefit or payment which under any Shared Contract was intended for the
other, DuPont and Buyer will use their respective reasonable best efforts to,
and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to, deliver such benefit or payment
to the other party.

and (y) Buyer shall make any assignments necessary to effectuate DuPont's or the
Retained Subsidiaries' ownership of such Patents, it being understood that (i)

5.20(a)(i)(B), (ii) with respect to Patents that relate solely to AII Blockers,
DuPont shall exercise its reasonable good faith judgment in making such
corrections, and (iii) with respect to Patents that relate to AII Blockers but
not solely, DuPont shall first obtain the consent of Buyer, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such Patents under

<Page>

Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any DuPont Merck Agreement or would result

Transferred Business Companies to comply with any and all obligations of such
Transferred Business Company under any of the DuPont Merck Agreements (including

obligations is reasonably likely to give rise to a Liability of DuPont or any
Retained Subsidiary.

                  (c) From and after the Closing, (i) DuPont shall not, and
shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries not to, amend, extend or modify any DuPont

terms of any DuPont Merck Agreement or would result in the termination of such
agreement or would be the subject of a guarantee or similar obligation of any
Transferred Business Company or any of the Transferred Business Companies
respective properties or assets and (ii) DuPont shall, and shall cause the
Retained Subsidiaries to, comply with any and all obligations of DuPont and such
Retained Subsidiaries under the DuPont Merck Agreements where the failure of

consent to (i) the assignment by DPC of the Agency Agreement (including all its
rights and obligations thereunder) to a reputable third-party manufacturer
capable of performing DPC's obligations thereunder or (ii) to any other
reasonable arrangement with Merck & Co. Inc. in lieu thereof for the supply to

Merck & Co. Inc. consents in writing to such assignment or alternative
arrangement. --------

all of their respective obligations and agreements pursuant to this Agreement
and hereby fully guarantees to Buyer and its Affiliates their performance

and after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, terminate or shorten the term of the Partnership Agreement

1993, between DuPont and Merck and Co. Inc. or (ii) the Losartan Finished
Product Supply Agreement, dated March 31, 1993, between DuPont and Merck & Co.,

ever been affiliated or with whom any Transferred Business Company joins or has
ever joined (or has ever been required to join) in filing prior to the Closing
Date, any consolidated combined or unitary Tax Return; PROVIDED that, for
purposes of this Section 6.1(a) DuPont shall be credited for any estimated or
other similar Tax payments made or accrued by DuPont, any of the Transferred
Business Companies, or any of their Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date;
and PROVIDED FURTHER that, except as otherwise provided by Section 6.4(b)(i),
DuPont shall be liable for Taxes of a Controlled Foreign Subsidiary or DPL for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such
Taxes exceeds $300,000 (the "FOREIGN TAX THRESHOLD AMOUNT"); (iv) any U.S.

                  (b) BUYER'S INDEMNIFICATION OF DUPONT. Buyer shall, and shall

to close any taxable year of the Transferred Business Companies as of the close
of business on the Closing Date.

                  (b) STRADDLE PERIODS. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), the Taxes
of the Transferred Business Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
Post-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) exemptions, allowances, credits, deductions or other Tax Items
(such as real, personal and other property or similar Taxes) that must under
applicable Law be calculated on an annual basis (including, without limitation,
the annual limitation applicable to any Transferred Business Company pursuant to
Section 382 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) and
(ii) all real, personal and other property or similar Taxes relating to the
Transferred Equipment shall be determined by reference to the relative number of
days in the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of such Straddle Period.

Section 6.2(a) hereof, DuPont and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the
partnership taxable year of DPC shall terminate as of the close of business on
the Closing Date, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.708-1(b)(3)
and 1.706-1(c), utilizing a "closing of the books" methodology.

            6.3 TAX RETURNS.

                  (a) Except as provided in Section 6.5 hereof, DuPont shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared in accordance with applicable Law, and file or
cause to be filed, when due, all Tax Returns (other than Straddle Period Tax
Returns) with respect to Taxes for which DuPont is responsible as described in

Companies to cooperate with, and take any


                                      101
<Page>

action reasonably requested by, DuPont with respect to the preparation and
filing of such Tax Returns. The immediately preceding sentence shall, in no way,
be construed as limiting or otherwise modifying the rights and obligations of
the parties under Section 6.7 hereof.

                  (b) Except as provided in Section 6.5 hereof, Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared in accordance with applicable Law (in the case
of any Straddle Period Tax Return, consistent with past practice for such Tax
Return) and file or cause to be filed, when due, all Tax Returns with respect to
the Transferred Business Companies and the Transferred Equipment required to be
filed other than those described in Section 6.3(a) hereof.

                  (c) If either DuPont or Buyer is obligated under this
Agreement to bear the economic burden for any portion of the Tax payable in
connection with any Tax Return to be prepared and filed by the other (or an
Affiliate of the other), the party responsible for filing such return (the
"PREPARER") shall prepare and deliver to the other party (the "PAYOR") a copy of
such return and any schedules, work papers and other documentation that are
relevant to the preparation of the portion of such return for which the Payor is
or may be liable hereunder not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
for such Tax Return (including applicable extensions) (the "DUE DATE"). The
Preparer shall not file such Tax Return until the earlier of (i) the receipt of
written notice from the Payor indicating the Payor's consent thereto, or (ii)
one (1) day prior to the Due Date.

                  The Payor shall have the option of providing to the Preparer,
at any time at least ten (10) days prior to the Due Date, written instructions
as to how the Payor wants any, or all, of the Tax Items for which it may be
liable reflected on such Tax Return. The Preparer shall, in preparing such Tax
Return, cause the items for which the Payor is liable hereunder to be reflected
in accordance with the Payor's instructions on such Tax Return. In the absence
of having received instructions from Payor, such items shall be reported in any
manner determined by the Preparer.

      6.4 CONTEST PROVISIONS.

                  (a) NOTIFICATION OF CONTESTS. DuPont and its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand (the "RECIPIENT"),
shall notify the other party in writing within ten (10) Business Days of receipt
by the Recipient of written notice of any pending or threatened audits,
adjustments, assessments, examinations or proceedings (whether judicial or
administrative) (a "TAX Audit") which may affect the liability for Taxes of such
other party or may give rise to an indemnification payment under Section 6.1 by
such other party. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Buyer shall notify
DuPont of any notice received


                                      102
<Page>

by Buyer relating to a Tax Audit of a Controlled Foreign Subsidiary or DPL for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period. If the Recipient fails to give such notice to the
other party, or if such notice is not in sufficient detail to notify the other
party of the nature of the Tax Audit, the Recipient shall not be entitled to
indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the
extent such failure to give notice materially adversely affects the other
party's right to participate in and contest the Tax Audit.

                  (b) WHICH PARTY CONTROLS.

                        (i) DUPONT'S ITEMS. If such Tax Audit relates to any
      Taxes for which DuPont is liable hereunder, DuPont shall at its expense
      control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit (including, without
      limitation, selection of counsel, determining whether to pursue or forego
      any and all administrative appeals, proceedings (whether judicial or
      administrative), hearings and conferences with any Tax Authority with
      respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax
      claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund
      suits or contest such Tax Audit in any permissible manner). In no case
      shall Buyer, the Transferred Business Companies or any of their Affiliates
      settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Audit referred to in the preceding
      sentence without DuPont's prior written consent. In addition, if a Tax
      Audit relates to a Tax of a Controlled Foreign Subsidiary for a
      Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Foreign Tax Threshold Amount has not been
      exceeded, DuPont shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control
      the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit, provided that DuPont agrees
      to be responsible for the Taxes assessed in such Tax Audit and any such
      Taxes shall not be applied to the Foreign Tax Threshold Amount.

                        (ii) BUYER'S ITEMS. If such Tax Audit relates to any
      Taxes for which Buyer is liable in full hereunder, Buyer shall at its
      expense control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit (including,
      without limitation, selection of counsel, determining whether to pursue or
      forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings (whether judicial
      or administrative), hearings and conferences with any Tax Authority with
      respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax
      claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund
      suits or contest such Tax Audit in any permissible manner).

                        (iii) COMBINED AND MIXED ITEMS. If such Tax Audit
      relates to Taxes for which both DuPont and Buyer are liable hereunder, to
      the extent possible such Tax Items will be distinguished and each party
      will control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so
      liable.

                        If such Tax Audit relates to any Straddle Period and any
      Tax Item cannot be identified as being a liability of only one party or
      cannot be separated from a Tax Item for which the other party is liable,
      the party which has the greater potential liability for those Tax Items
      that cannot be so attributed or separated (or both) shall control the
      defense and settlement of the Tax Audit, PROVIDED that, such party defends
      the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return.

                        (iv) PARTICIPATION RIGHTS. Any party who is entitled to
      participate but does not control a Tax Audit under this Section 6.4(b)
      shall participate at its own expense in the defense of such Tax Audit and
      employ counsel of its choice at its expense and the party controlling such
      Tax Audit under this Section 6.4(b) shall in good faith keep such party
      informed with respect to such Tax Audit and, upon the reasonable request
      of such party, shall consult with such party from time to time regarding
      the conduct of such Tax Audit.

            6.5 TRANSFER TAXES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, one-half of all excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including
real property transfer), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other
similar taxes arising directly or indirectly from the Closing ("TRANSFER
TAXES"), shall be paid to the appropriate Tax Authority by DuPont and one-half
of such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Buyer. Notwithstanding Section 6.3
hereof, which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax
Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared
and filed when due by the party primarily responsible for filing such Tax
Returns under the applicable Law imposing such Transfer Taxes; PROVIDED that
such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed jointly by DuPont and Buyer if
either (i) no party to this Agreement is or (ii) both DuPont, on the one hand,
and Buyer, DPC or the Transferred Business Companies, on the other hand, are
primarily responsible for filing such Tax Returns under the applicable Law
imposing such Transfer Taxes.

ACTIONS.

                  (a) BUYER'S CLAIMING, RECEIVING OR USING OF REFUNDS AND
OVERPAYMENTS. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates (a) receives any refund of Tax,
or (B) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which, in each case (a)
and (B), (x) relates to Taxes paid or accrued by DuPont or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or portion thereof,
ending on or before the Closing Date, or (y) is the subject of indemnification
by DuPont pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to DuPont, within ten (10) days of receipt, the entire amount of
the refund or overpayment (including interest), net of any Tax payable by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates with respect thereto (including with respect to any
interest on such refund or overpayment), received or utilized by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates. Buyer agrees to notify DuPont within ten (10) days after the
discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt of
any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Buyer agrees to claim
any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as possible and to
furnish to DuPont all information, records and assistance necessary to verify
the amount of the refund or overpayment. The amount of economic benefit of any
refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes of the Transferred Business Companies for
any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between DuPont and Buyer on a
"closing of the books" basis, except with respect to items calculated on an
annual or per diem basis, in which case apportionment shall be on a pro rata
basis.

                  (b) DUPONT'S CLAIMING, RECEIVING OR USING OF REFUNDS AND
OVERPAYMENTS. If DuPont or any of its Affiliates (a) receives any refund of Tax,
or (B) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which, in each case (A)
and (B), (x) relates to Taxes paid by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing
Date (including any refund of Tax in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by reason of a
carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period) or (y) is the subject of
indemnification by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, DuPont shall transfer, or
cause to be transferred, to Buyer, within ten (10) days of receipt, the entire
amount of the refund or overpayment (including interest), net of any Tax payable
by DuPont or any of its Affiliates with respect thereto (including with respect
to any interest on such refund or overpayment), received or utilized by DuPont
or any of its Affiliates. DuPont agrees to notify Buyer within ten (10) days
after the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the
receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. DuPont agrees
to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as possible
and to furnish to Buyer all information, records and assistance necessary to
verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

                  (c) PRE-CLOSING TAX RETURNS. None of Buyer, the Transferred
Business Companies or any of their Affiliates shall amend any Tax Return
prepared and filed by DuPont pursuant to Section 6.3(a) hereof. DuPont agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to claim any refund arising from carrybacks from
a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period as soon as possible.

                  (d) SECTION 338(g) AND (h)(10) ELECTIONS. DuPont and Buyer
agree to make Section 338(g) elections with respect to the Controlled Foreign
Subsidiaries and that no Section 338(g) election shall be made with respect to
DPL. DuPont and Buyer agree to make Section 338(h)(10) elections with respect to
DPRL and DCI.

                  (e) PR TAX GRANT. DuPont and Buyer acknowledge that Buyer may
seek an amendment to Buyer's existing grant with respect to Puerto Rico Taxes
and intends for the PR Tax Grant to terminate as to DuPont as of the Closing
Date, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that DuPont and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith and
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain a letter agreement, amendment to the
PR Tax Grant, or similar agreement as expeditiously as possible (and to the
extent reasonably possible prior to August 15, 2001) from the necessary
Governmental Authorities (including, without limitation, the Puerto Rico
Department of State-Office of Industrial Tax Exemption, The Puerto Rico
Department of Treasury and the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company),
permitting a termination as to DuPont or amendment of the PR Tax Grant as of the
Closing Date which provides in substance that, after the Closing, none of
DuPont, DPL or any DuPont Affiliate shall have any further obligations under the
PR Tax Grant and that there will be no loss of Tax benefits (including Tax
Assets) and no additional Taxes to DuPont or its Affiliates (including DPL) for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period by reason of the termination (the "PR Tax
Amendment"). Buyer and DuPont agree that to the extent that obtaining the PR Tax
Amendment results in incremental costs to Buyer that Buyer would not have
incurred except by reason of the PR Tax Amendment, DuPont shall indemnify Buyer
for 50% of such costs up to $15,000,000 and that DuPont shall bear all direct
costs of obtaining the PR Tax Amendment in excess of $15,000,000. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, costs taken into account are intended to include
costs of complying with the requirements imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authorities, but not incidental or similar costs including costs of negotiating
the PR Tax Amendment.

            6.7 MUTUAL COOPERATION. DuPont and Buyer will cooperate with each
other in paying any Taxes, filing any Tax Return and conducting any Tax Audit
(including, without limitation, any judicial or administrative proceeding)
contemplated by this Agreement and, except as set forth to the contrary in this
Agreement, take such action as the other party may reasonably request including,
without

cooperate in any Tax Audit or investigation of any Tax Return and execute
appropriate powers of attorney in favor of the other party and/or its agents;
(c) file protests or otherwise contest any proposed or asserted Tax
deficiencies, including filing petitions for redetermination or prosecuting
actions for refund in any court, and pursuing the appeal of any such actions;
(d) execute Tax Returns or other documents reasonably required by the other
party; (e) take any of the actions of the type described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-77(a), which describes the scope of the agency of the common
parent of a group of affiliated corporations; (f) provide complete access to,
and comply with reasonable requests for copies of, all Tax Returns, books and
records, data, documents, work papers, materials and other information relating
to the Taxes of the Transferred Business Companies for any taxable period; (g)
make reasonably available to each other, its officers, directors, employees and
agents for any fact finding, consultation and discussions related to the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return, the conduct of any Tax Audit
(including, without limitation, any judicial or administrative proceeding), and
any other matter with respect to Taxes; (h) execute such powers of attorney as
are reasonably requested and required by DuPont or any of DuPont's Affiliates or
Buyer or any of Buyer's Affiliates on behalf of, as the case may be, Buyer or
any of Buyer's Affiliates or DuPont or any of DuPont's Affiliates to enable the
requesting party to represent the other party in a Tax Audit involving a Tax for
which the requesting party is liable under applicable Law; and (i) provide data
requested related to the earnings and profits of DPL and information
specifically required under Section 1248 of the Code and Treasury Regulation
1.1248-7. DuPont and Buyer hereby agree to reimburse each other for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (excluding officers' or employees' salaries and general
corporate overhead and other similar expenses) incurred by the other in
connection with satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.8.

            6.8 MAINTENANCE OF BOOKS AND RECORDS. Until the applicable statute
of limitation (including periods of waiver) has expired for any Tax Return filed
or required to be filed covering the periods up to and including the Closing
Date (including any Straddle Periods), Buyer and its Affiliates shall retain all
Tax work papers and related materials in its possession and under its control
that were used in the preparation of any such Tax Return. Buyer will notify
DuPont sixty (60) days prior to disposing of any Tax records relating to taxable
periods and will deliver to DuPont any such records requested by DuPont.

            6.9 MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) TERMINATION OF EXISTING TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. DuPont
hereby agrees and covenants that any Tax Sharing Agreement to which any of the
Transferred Business Companies is a party will cease to apply to the Transferred
Business Companies as of the Closing Date.

                  (B) SECTION 41 NOTIFICATION. Pursuant to Code Section
41(f)(3)(B), DuPont shall provide Buyer with the "qualified research
expenditures" (as DuPont has interpreted Code Section 41(b)) and the "gross
receipts" (as DuPont has interpreted Code Section 41(c)(6)) used by DuPont to
calculate the "fixed base percentage" as defined in Code Section 41(c)(3) of the
Business being acquired by Buyer.

                  (c) INTERPRETATION. To the extent that there is a conflict
between any provision of this Article VI and any other provision of this
Agreement that otherwise would be applicable with respect to any Taxes, Tax
Returns, Tax Audits, Tax indemnification claims or any other matter related to
Taxes, the provisions of this Article VI shall govern.

                  (b) PERFORMANCE BY THE SELLERS. The Sellers shall have

                  (d) Any calculation of Losses for purposes of this Section 8.4
(including for purposes of determining the amount of Losses for purposes of
sub-sections (h) and (i) below) or any indemnity payments made under Article VI
hereof shall be (i) net of any insurance recovery made by the Indemnified Party
(whether paid directly to such Indemnified Party or assigned by the Indemnifying
Party to such Indemnified Party) and (ii) (x) increased to take into account any
net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt or
accrual of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed-up for such increase) and (y)
reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party
arising from the deductibility of any such Losses or Taxes. Any indemnification
payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to this paragraph and
shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such net Tax cost (including
gross-up) or net Tax benefit only after the Indemnified Party has actually
realized such cost or benefit. For purposes of this Agreement, an Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to have "actually realized" a net Tax cost or a net Tax
benefit to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by
such Indemnified Party is increased above or reduced below, as the case may be,
the amount of Taxes that such Indemnified Party would have been required to pay
but for the receipt or accrual of the indemnity payment or the deductibility of
such Losses or Taxes, as the case may be. The amount of any increase or
reduction hereunder shall be adjusted to reflect any Final Determination with
respect to the Indemnified Party's liability for Taxes and, if necessary, DuPont
or Buyer, as the case may be, shall make payments to the other to reflect such
adjustment. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, for Tax purposes, unless a Final Determination
with respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates causes any such
payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes. Each of the parties shall notify the other parties if it receives
notice that any Tax Authority proposes to treat any indemnity payment under this
Agreement as other than an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. A
party (and its Affiliates) shall not be deemed to have suffered a "Loss" with
respect to an item to the extent such party was actually compensated therefor by
reason of an increase in the amount otherwise paid to it or a reduction in the
amount otherwise paid by it pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof.

                  (e) No Action, claim or setoff for Losses subject to
indemnification under this Section 8.4 shall be brought or made with respect to
claims for Losses resulting from a breach of any covenant contained in this
Agreement, or in any representation, after the date on which such covenant or
representation shall terminate pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof; and PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any claim made after the Closing with reasonable specificity by
the party seeking indemnification (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") to the party from
which indemnification is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") within the time
periods set forth in Section 8.3 shall survive (and be subject to
indemnification) until it is finally and fully resolved.

                  (f) (i) Upon receipt by the Indemnified Party of notice from a
third party of any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment against
such Indemnified Party which might give rise to a claim for Losses under Section
8.4, the Indemnified Party (or DuPont or Buyer on behalf of an Indemnified
Party) shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party
indicating the nature of such claim and the basis therefor; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. A claim to indemnity hereunder may, at
the option of the Indemnified Party, be asserted as soon as Losses have been
threatened by a third party orally or in writing, regardless of whether actual
harm has been suffered or out-of-pocket expenses incurred; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
the Indemnified Party shall first have reasonably determined that it may be
liable or otherwise incur such Losses. However, payments for Losses for Third
Party Claims which are otherwise covered by the indemnification obligations
herein shall not be required except to the extent that the Indemnified Party has
expended out-of-pocket sums. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
option, to assume the defense of, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any
such matter involving the asserted liability of the Indemnified Party as to
which the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged its obligation to fully
indemnify the Indemnified Party. If any Indemnifying Party shall, in accordance
with the preceding sentence, undertake to compromise or defend any such asserted
liability, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do
so, and the Indemnified Party shall agree to cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense against, any
such asserted liability; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any such asserted liability without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the immediately preceding
proviso shall not apply in the case of any settlement which releases the
Indemnified Party completely in connection with such matter and which provides
relief consisting solely of money damages borne by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of such action or proceeding,
such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense of such action or proceeding. The Indemnifying Party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of one such separate counsel
in each jurisdiction (and shall pay such fees, costs and expenses at least
quarterly), if, but only if, (i) the defendants in, or targets of, any such
action or proceeding include both an Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may
be legal defenses available to it or to other Indemnified Parties which are
different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party (in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the defense
of such action or proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party); (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party to represent such Indemnified Party within a reasonable


                                      115
<Page>

time after notice of the institution of such action or proceeding; or (iii) the
Indemnifying Party shall authorize such Indemnified Party to employ separate
counsel at the Indemnifying Party's expense. In addition, the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense thereof. In any event, the Indemnified Party and its counsel shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel and shall not assert any
position in any proceeding inconsistent with that asserted by the Indemnifying
Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not prevent the Indemnified
Party from taking the position that it is entitled to indemnification hereunder.
All out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with an Indemnified
Party's cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. In any event, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at its own expense to participate in the
defense of such asserted liability.

                        (ii) In the event any Indemnified Party should have an
indemnification claim against any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that
does not involve a claim by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party in writing and in
reasonable detail. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such failure. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 20 Business Days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such
claim, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article
VIII and the Indemnifying Party shall pay amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand, or in the case of any notice in which the amount of
the claim is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim is
finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with
respect to such claim in a timely manner, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such
dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be
resolved by litigation in the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.

                  (g) The indemnification provisions of this Article VIII (i)
shall, in the case of the representations and warranties, be the exclusive
remedy following the Closing with respect to breaches thereof, (ii) shall apply
without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of
set-off, limitation or otherwise and (iii) are intended to be comprehensive and
not to be limited by any requirements of Law concerning prominence of language
or waiver of any legal right


                                      116
<Page>

under any Law (including, without limitation, rights under any workers
compensation statute or similar statute conferring immunity from suit). The
obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 8.4 and in Section 8.5
shall be conditioned upon the Closing having occurred.

                  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
except with respect to breaches of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1 and 4.2 (as to
which none of the provisions of this Section 8.4(h) shall apply), neither DuPont
nor Buyer shall be required to provide indemnification under Sections
8.4(a)(iii) and 8.4(b)(iv) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties or DuPont
Indemnified Parties, respectively, unless the aggregate amount of Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or DuPont Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, with respect to such breaches (in the aggregate), exceeds $100
million (the "BASKET"), in which case the obligation to provide indemnification
under Sections 8.4(a)(iii) and 8.4(b)(iv) to the Buyer Indemnified Parties or
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, shall only apply with respect to
such amounts that are in excess of the Basket; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Losses
covered by the indemnification provisions of Article VI or Section 8.5 hereof
shall not be applied, or be subject, to the Basket.

                  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
except with respect to breaches of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.15, 4.1 and 4.2 (as
to which none of the provisions of this Section 8.4(i) shall apply), neither
DuPont nor Buyer shall be required to provide indemnification to Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively, under
Sections 8.4(a)(iii) and 8.4(b)(iv) when the amount of Losses paid by DuPont or
Buyer, as applicable, with respect thereto exceeds 30% of the Purchase Price
(the "CAP"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Losses covered by the indemnification
provisions of Article VI or Section 8.5 hereof shall not be applied, or be
subject, to the Cap.

            8.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (a) CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Section 8.5, (i)
"TRANSFERRED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS" shall mean (A) the Transferred Assets, (B)
all other Assets of any of the Transferred Business Companies acquired from and
after the Closing or used in the operation or conduct of the Transferred
Business from and after the Closing, and (C) all Assets and businesses listed on
Schedule 8.5(a)(i); and (ii) "RETAINED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSETS" shall mean (A) the
Assets of DuPont and the Retained Subsidiaries following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the Former DPC Assets, and (C)
all Assets of DuPont and the Retained Subsidiaries acquired from and after the
Closing and used in the operation or conduct of the Retained Business from and
after the Closing, but, in each case of this clause (ii), excluding all
Transferred Environmental Assets.

<Page>

                  (b) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, DuPont agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties from and against and shall reimburse such Indemnitees with
respect to all Losses, other than those relating to matters set forth in
Schedule 3.12, arising out of or related to, directly or indirectly, those
Losses with respect to all Environmental Claims and requirements of
Environmental Laws (whether or not under applicable Law DuPont or any Retained
Subsidiary would have a right of contribution against any Transferred Business
Company therefor) set forth below (the "SELLER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES"):

                        (i) Losses with respect to the Transferred Environmental
      Assets arising from or in connection with the generation, manufacturing,
      transporting, storage, handling, treatment, storage, spill, discharge, or
      disposal of any Hazardous Substances prior to the Closing, including but
      not limited to Losses arising from the presence of Hazardous Substances
      at, on or under any of Transferred Environmental Assets prior to the
      Closing or at, on or under any property or facility not located on any of
      the Transferred Environmental Assets into which Hazardous Substances from
      any of the Transferred Environmental Assets were disposed prior to the
      Closing;

                        (ii) Losses arising from the failure of the Transferred
      Environmental Assets to be in compliance prior to the Closing with any
      Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits in effect as of and
      enforceable as of the Closing whether or not such failure is the subject
      of notification from a Governmental Authority either before or after the
      Closing;

                        (iii) Losses relating to any Environmental Claim to the
      extent arising from actual or alleged pre-Closing exposure to or Release
      of Hazardous Substances at or from the operations of the Transferred
      Environmental Assets; and

                        (iv) Losses with respect to the Transferred
      Environmental Assets arising after the Closing and emanating from, or in
      any way related to, the operation of any of the Retained Environmental
      Assets.

                  (c) The indemnity in Section 8.5(b) shall be subject to the
following limitations: (i) if the costs of cleanup or correcting non-compliance
with Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits subject to indemnity by Buyer
and its


                                      118
<Page>

Subsidiaries are increased after the Closing Date due to an act or omission by a
Person other than DuPont and its Subsidiaries, their agents, contractors and
subcontractors, acting on their own or under the supervision or direction of any
Governmental Authority, to the extent not resulting from a change in
Environmental Laws after the Closing, DuPont and its Subsidiaries shall not be
responsible for any such increase in costs incurred; (ii) if DuPont or any of
its Subsidiaries are performing their obligations pursuant to Section 8.5(b),
DuPont and its Subsidiaries shall not be responsible for the costs associated
with Buyer's oversight of DuPont and its Subsidiaries' performance, including
the cost of Buyer's oversight of DuPont and its Subsidiaries' legal counsel,
consultants, or employees; and (iii) in performing the obligations under this
Section 8.5(b), DuPont and its Subsidiaries shall not be responsible for any
costs that are incurred by Buyer and its Subsidiaries due to any change related
to the Transferred Environmental Assets resulting or arising from (a) the
closure or sale of a facility or business, (b) the construction of new
structures or equipment, or the modification to existing structures or
equipment, (c) a change in use of any facility to a use substantially unrelated
to that at Closing, or (d) capital improvements or repairs and modifications to
capital improvements, PROVIDED THAT DuPont shall be responsible for any such
capital improvements, repairs and modifications to or associated with the
Transferred Environmental Assets to the extent required to allow the facility to
meet pre-Closing requirements of Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits at
levels of production substantially equivalent to those at Closing or
necessitated by any condition existing on or related to the Transferred
Environmental Assets prior to Closing.

                  (d) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against and shall reimburse such Indemnitees with
respect to all Losses arising out of or related to, directly or indirectly,
those Liabilities with respect to all Environmental Claims and requirements of
Environmental Laws (whether or not under applicable Law DuPont would have a
right of contribution against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries) set forth below
(the "BUYER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES"):

                        (i) Liabilities arising from or in connection with the
      generation, manufacturing, transporting, storage, handling, treatment,
      storage, spill or discharge of any Hazardous Substances at the Transferred
      Environmental Assets or otherwise arising from the operation of the
      Transferred Environmental Assets after the Closing;

                        (ii) Liabilities arising from the failure of the
      Transferred Environmental Assets after the Closing to be in compliance
      with any Environmental Laws; and


                                      119
<Page>

                        (iii) Liabilities arising from the matters set forth in
      Schedule 3.12 hereto.

                  (e) As between the parties to this Agreement, (i) Buyer will
have full authority to control, direct, manage and implement remediation and to
determine its scope, and conduct all negotiations, meetings and settlements with
Governmental Authorities with respect to Buyer Environmental Liabilities;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer may contract with DuPont on mutually agreeable
terms for DuPont to perform any such activities with respect to Buyer
Environmental Liabilities on Buyer's behalf, for such reasonable period of time
until an orderly transfer of such activities to Buyer can be arranged, and (ii)
DuPont will have authority to control, direct, manage and implement remediation
and to determine its scope, and conduct all negotiations, meetings and
settlements with Governmental Authorities with respect to Seller Environmental
Liabilities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that DuPont may contract with Buyer on mutually
agreeable terms for Buyer to perform any such activities with respect to Seller
Environmental Liabilities on DuPont's behalf, for such reasonable period of time
until an orderly transfer of such activities to DuPont can be arranged, and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Buyer, either directly or through its designee, will
have the right to participate in all discussions, negotiations and settlements
with any Governmental Authority concerning any remediation or other activity
relating to the Transferred Environmental Assets, including receiving in a
timely fashion copies of all communications, correspondence and data relating to
such remediation and activity, and the right to comment directly and
independently to the pertinent Governmental Authority on any matter that could
affect ongoing operations at any of the Transferred Environmental Assets; and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries are performing their
obligations pursuant to Section 8.5(d), they shall not be responsible for any
costs associated with DuPont's oversight of Buyer, including costs attributable
to oversight of Buyer's and its Subsidiaries' legal counsel, consultants or
employees.

                  (f) Any claim for Indemnity by a Buyer Indemnified Party
seeking indemnification under Section 8.5(b) must be received by DuPont within
five years of the Closing, except that there shall be no time limit for claims
brought under 8.5(b)(iii) relating to toxic tort claims. If a claim is not
received within the applicable time period, it shall no longer constitute a
Seller Environmental Liability and shall become a Liability of Buyer and Buyer
shall indemnify DuPont and its Subsidiaries against any Liability arising from
such a claim.

                  (g) Notwithstanding any provisions of Environmental Laws or
the provisions or principles of any other statutory or common law including,
without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, as amended, and state law analogues, the provisions of this
Section 8.5


                                      120
<Page>

and, to the extent relating to environmental matters, Section 8.4, shall
constitute the parties' exclusive remedy with respect to each other for all
Environmental Claims and Liabilities under Environmental Laws arising from the
ownership of, or conduct of business with respect to, the Transferred
Environmental Assets or the Retained Environmental Assets. The obligations of
the parties set forth in this Section 8.5 shall be conditioned upon the Closing
having occurred.

                  (h) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.5 or as
would be inconsistent herewith, the provisions of Sections 8.4(d), (f) and (g)
shall apply to this Section 8.5 and claims for indemnification hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            9.1 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATIONS. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time by the parties hereto, but only by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties.

            9.2 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties
hereto entitled to the benefits of the respective term or provision may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of the party not entitled to the benefits of such extension or
waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of
any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of,
or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right preclude other or
further exercise thereof or any other right.

            9.3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ETC. (a) Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that neither DuPont nor any Subsidiary thereof nor any
of their Representatives is making any representation or warranty whatsoever,
express or implied, except those representations and warranties explicitly set
forth in this Agreement and the Related Agreements.

            (b) DuPont hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer nor any
Subsidiary thereof nor any of their Representatives is making any


                                      121
<Page>

representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, except those
representations and warranties explicitly set forth in this Agreement and the
Related Agreements.

            9.4 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement, together with the
Related Agreements, (a) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement) and (b) shall
not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer
may assign its rights and obligations to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer
(unless to do so would restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of
its obligations hereunder.

            9.5 VALIDITY. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provisions of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and
effect.

            9.6 NOTICES. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been

            9.8 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that if any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine,
and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties is listed (in which
case the party so required to make such release shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment thereon in advance
of such issuance), no press release or similar public announcement or
communication shall, if prior to the Closing, be made or be caused to be made
concerning the execution or performance of this Agreement unless the parties
shall have agreed in advance with respect thereto.

<Page>

shall be in any state or federal court in the State of Delaware. The parties
hereto further agree that the parties will not bring suit with respect to any
disputes arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not limit the rights of the parties to obtain
execution of judgment in any other jurisdiction; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER,
that the foregoing shall not limit (i) DuPont's or any of its Subsidiaries'
ability or right to join, implead or otherwise bring any third-party claim
against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in an action brought against DuPont or
any of its Subsidiaries by a third party in a jurisdiction outside of the State

to the extent permitted by law, that final and unappealable judgment against a
party in any action or proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by

conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

                  (b) (i) By the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer

any and all such documents and instruments, as may be necessary to continue such
designation and appointment of the Agent in full force and effect so long as
this Agreement shall be in effect. The foregoing shall not limit the rights of
any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect
of its obligations with respect to this Agreement, and (ii) submits to the

                        20, 2001 (this "AGREEMENT"), between BRISTOL-MYERS
                        SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation ("SELLER"), and
                        THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY, an Ohio corporation
                        ("BUYER").

            Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to
Buyer, all the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $10 per
share (the "CLAIROL SHARES"), of Clairol Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (the "COMPANY").

            Buyer also desires to purchase from the subsidiaries of Seller set
forth under the relevant caption in Exhibit A (each, an "INTERNATIONAL STOCK
SELLING ENTITY"), and Seller desires to cause the International Stock Selling
Entities to sell to Buyer and its designated Buyer Subsidiaries, all the issued
and outstanding capital stock owned by Seller and its subsidiaries (the
"INTERNATIONAL SHARES") of each of the subsidiaries of Seller set forth under
the relevant caption in Exhibit A attached hereto (each, an "INTERNATIONAL
CLAIROL SUBSIDIARY").

            Seller's customer management organization in the United States (the
"CMO") distributes and sells products of the Company, together with products of
other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer and Seller desire that
Buyer acquire all Seller's CMO business and operations and that, following such
acquisition, Buyer provide certain transitional distribution and sales services
to Seller and its Affiliates as contemplated by the CMO Transitional Services
Agreement. Accordingly, Buyer desires to acquire from Seller, and Seller desires
to sell to Buyer, the CMO Acquired Assets. Buyer desires to assume, and Seller
desires to assign, the CMO Assumed Liabilities.

            Seller and certain of its subsidiaries set forth in Exhibit B-1
(each, a "U.S. ASSET SELLING ENTITY") hold certain assets of, and provide
certain services to, the Acquired Business. Buyer and Seller desire that Buyer
acquire such assets and certain other assets related to the provision of such
services and assume certain liabilities related thereto. Accordingly, Buyer
desires to acquire from Seller and the U.S. Asset Selling Entities, and Seller
and the U.S. Asset Selling Entities desire to sell to Buyer, the Other U.S.
Acquired Assets. Buyer desires to assume, and

                                                                               2


Seller and the U.S. Asset Selling Entities desire to assign, the Other U.S.
Assumed Liabilities.

            Seller and certain of its subsidiaries set forth in Exhibit B-2
(each, an "INTERNATIONAL ASSET SELLING ENTITY") manufacture, market, distribute
or sell the products of the Acquired Business (other than the CMO) or otherwise
have assets or liabilities of the Acquired Business (other than the CMO) in each
of the corresponding countries set forth in Exhibit B-2. Buyer desires to
acquire, or to cause its designated Buyer Subsidiaries to acquire, from Seller
and the Asset Selling Entities, and Seller desires to transfer, and to cause the
Asset Selling Entities to transfer, to Buyer and its designated Buyer
Subsidiaries, the International Acquired Assets. Buyer desires to assume, and
Seller desires to assign, the International Assumed Liabilities.

            Buyer desires to hire certain employees associated with the Acquired
Business, as set forth in this Agreement and the Other Transaction Documents.

            Section 15.07(c) identifies the Sections of this Agreement in which
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined.

            Accordingly, Seller and Buyer hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

           PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE CLAIROL SHARES, THE INTERNATIONAL

                                                                               3


the U.S. Acquired Assets and (iv) Seller will, and will cause the International
Asset Selling Entities to, sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer
or its designated Buyer Subsidiaries, and Buyer will purchase or cause such
Buyer Subsidiaries, to purchase from the International Asset Selling Entities,

after the Six Month Anniversary, interest on the Purchase Price accrued from the
Six Month Anniversary to the Closing Date at the Prime Rate, payable and subject
to adjustment as set forth in Article II, and (B) the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities. The purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares, the International
Shares, the U.S. Acquired Assets and the International Acquired Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities is referred to in this Agreement,
collectively, as the "TRANSACTION".

            (b) The purchase and sale of the International Shares with respect
to each International Clairol Subsidiary will be effected pursuant to short-form
stock purchase agreements (each, an "INTERNATIONAL STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT") in
substantially the same form as the form of International Stock Purchase
Agreement attached as Exhibit C to this Agreement, except (as Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably agree) for (i) the deletion of provisions which are
inapplicable to such International Clairol Subsidiary, (ii) such changes as may
be necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable local law, (iii) such
changes as may be reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Buyer regarding employees
and employee benefits matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant International Clairol Subsidiary and country or
countries in which it operates, PROVIDED that such changes shall be consistent
with the principles underlying the corresponding provisions of this Agreement
and (iv) such other changes as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer.

            (c) The transfer of each International Business Unit (including the
International Acquired Assets and International Assumed Liabilities) will be
effected pursuant to short-form asset purchase agreements (the "INTERNATIONAL
ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS") on a country-by-country basis. Each International
Asset Purchase Agreement shall be in substantially the same form as the form of
International Asset Purchase Agreement attached as Exhibit D, except (as Buyer
and Seller shall reasonably agree) for (i) the deletion of provisions which are
inapplicable to such International Business Unit, (ii) such changes as may be

<Page>
                                                                               4


necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable local law, (iii) such
changes as may be reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Buyer regarding employees
and employee benefits matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant International Business Unit and country, provided
that such changes shall be consistent with the terms and conditions of, and
principles underlying, the corresponding provisions of this Agreement, and (iv)
such other changes as may be agreed by Seller and Buyer.

            (d) Buyer and Seller agree to allocate a portion of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02) to the International Shares and the
Acquired Assets in accordance with Exhibit E, and the remainder of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02) to the Clairol Shares, in each case
in accordance with Section 12.05. Buyer and Seller shall further agree on the
allocation of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.02) with
respect to the Acquired Assets on a country-by-country or asset-by-asset basis.
A proposed Exhibit E shall be prepared by Seller and delivered to Buyer not
later than 30 days prior to Closing and Buyer and Seller shall reach agreement
on a final Exhibit E no later than 120 days after the Closing Date. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to reach agreement on a final Exhibit E by the end of such
120-day period, either party may refer any items of disagreement to the
Accounting Firm for resolution within 45 days of the receipt of such submission
using procedures comparable to those provided in Section 2.02(a)(iii).

            SECTION 1.02. ASSUMPTION OF THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES. On the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall, on the Closing
Date, assume and shall pay, honor, perform and discharge (or cause to be
assumed, paid, honored, performed and discharged) when due all the U.S. Assumed
Liabilities and the International Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the
"ASSUMED LIABILITIES").

            SECTION 1.03. CONSENTS OF THIRD PARTIES. (a) Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute
an agreement to assign any asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
under or resulting from such asset if an attempted assignment thereof, without
the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or other contravention
of the rights of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any
party to an agreement concerning such asset, or would in any way adversely
affect the rights of Seller or

<Page>
                                                                               5


the Seller Entities or, upon transfer, Buyer or its designated Buyer Subsidiary
under such asset. If any transfer or assignment by Seller or any Seller Entity
to, or any assumption by Buyer or its designated Buyer Subsidiary of, any
interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any asset requires
the consent of a third party, then such assignment or assumption shall be made
subject to such consent being obtained.

            (b) If any such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller
and the Seller Entities, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, shall cooperate (at their own expense) in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer under which (i)
Buyer or its designated Buyer Subsidiary shall obtain (without infringing upon
the legal rights of such third party or outside party or violating any
Applicable Law) the economic claims, rights and benefits (net of the amount of
any related Tax costs imposed on Seller and its Affiliates) under the asset,
claim or right with respect to which the consent has not been obtained in
accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall assume any related economic
burden (including the amount of any related Tax costs imposed on Seller and its
Affiliates) with respect to the asset, claim or right with respect to which the
consent has not been obtained (including any related Assumed Liability).

                                   ARTICLE II

                       CLOSING; PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT

            SECTION 2.01. CLOSING. (a) Each of the Buyer and Seller are
obligated to consummate the closing (the "CLOSING") of the Transaction on the
earlier of (i) the second business day after the first date on which all the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article III shall have been satisfied and
(ii) the Twelve Month Anniversary; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if on the Twelve
Month Anniversary, (x) any of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01 (other
than the conditions set forth in Sections 3.01(b) and (c)) shall not have been
satisfied (or waived in writing by Buyer), (y) any of the conditions set forth
in Section 3.02 shall not have been satisfied (or waived in writing by Seller)
or (z) any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other similar legal
restraint or prohibition or other order enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced
or issued by any U.S. Governmental Entity shall be

<Page>
                                                                               6


in effect that prevents the purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares, then the
Closing shall occur no later than the second business day after the satisfaction
of such conditions or the termination of such restraint or prohibition, as
applicable. The Closing shall be held on the Closing Date at 10:00 a.m. at the
offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New
York, New York. The date on which the Closing shall occur is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."

            (b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, by wire transfer
to a bank account designated in writing by Seller at least two business days
prior to the Closing Date, immediately available funds in an amount equal to the
sum of (i) the Purchase Price plus or minus (ii) an estimate, prepared by Seller
and delivered to Buyer at least two business days prior to the Closing Date, of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.02(b) plus (iii) any
interest payable to Seller pursuant to Section 1.01(a). The Purchase Price plus
or minus such estimate of any such adjustment under Section 2.02(b) is
hereinafter called the "CLOSING DATE AMOUNT".

            (c) Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
certificates representing the Clairol Shares, duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer,
with appropriate transfer stamps, if any, affixed.

            (d) Seller (acting as agent for the International Stock Selling
Entities) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or its designated
Buyer Subsidiary with respect to each International Clairol Subsidiary (i)
certificates representing the International Shares for such International
Clairol Subsidiary, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly
endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate transfer stamps,
if any, affixed, or other appropriate instruments sufficient to evidence the
transfer of the International Shares under the Applicable Laws of the relevant
jurisdiction, and (ii) an appropriately executed International Stock Purchase
Agreement for each such International Clairol Subsidiary. Buyer shall deliver,
or cause its designated Buyer Subsidiary to deliver, to Seller (acting as agent
for the International Stock Selling Entities) an appropriately executed
International Stock Purchase Agreement for each International Clairol
Subsidiary.

            (e)(i) Seller (acting for itself and as agent for the Asset Selling
Entities) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or its designated
Buyer Subsidiary such appropriately executed instruments of sale, assignment,
transfer and conveyance (including its counterpart signature page to each
applicable International Asset Purchase Agreement) in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller and their respective counsel
evidencing and effecting the sale, assignment, and transfer to Buyer or
designated Buyer Subsidiaries of the U.S. Acquired Assets and the International
Acquired Assets (collectively, the "ACQUIRED ASSETS") (it being understood that
such instruments shall not require the Seller or, as the case may be, the Asset
Selling Entities to make any additional representations, warranties or
covenants, expressed or implied, not contained in this Agreement) and (ii) Buyer
shall deliver or cause to be delivered by its applicable Buyer Subsidiaries to
Seller appropriately executed counterparts to such instruments of sale,
assignment, transfer and conveyance (including its counterpart signature page to
each applicable International Asset Purchase Agreement), and appropriately
executed instruments of assumption (it being understood that such instruments
described above shall not require Buyer or, as the case may be, Buyer
Subsidiaries, to make any additional representations, warranties or covenants,
expressed or implied, or assume any additional liabilities, expressed or
implied, not contained in this Agreement) by Buyer or its applicable Buyer
Subsidiaries of the Assumed Liabilities, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, Seller and their respective counsel. The documents and
instruments referred to in Section 2.01(c), (d) and (e), together with the
International Stock Purchase Agreements and the International Asset Purchase
Agreements, are collectively referred to herein as the "TRANSFER DOCUMENTS".

            SECTION 2.02. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. (a) (i) Within 90 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement
(the "WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT"), setting forth Working Capital as of the close
of business on the Closing Date ("CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL"). The Working Capital
Statement is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "STATEMENT". The Statement
shall be accompanied by a certificate of Buyer stating that the Statement has
been prepared in compliance with the applicable requirements of this Section
2.02.

            (ii) The Statement shall become final and binding on the parties on
the sixtieth day following receipt thereof by the Seller, unless Seller gives
written notice of its

<Page>
                                                                               8


disagreement with the Statement (a "NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT") to Buyer prior to
such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (A) specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted and (B) only include disagreements based
on mathematical errors or based on Closing Working Capital not being calculated
in accordance with this Section 2.02. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by
Buyer in a timely manner, then the Statement (as revised in accordance with
clause (1) or (2) below) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Buyer,
on the earlier of (1) the date Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in such Notice of
Disagreement and (2) the date all disputed matters specified in such Notice of
Disagreement are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm.

            (iii) During the 60-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences which they may have with respect to the matters specified in
such Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 60-day period, Seller and Buyer
shall submit to an internationally recognized independent accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM") for review and
resolution of any and all matters which remain in dispute and which were
properly included in such Notice of Disagreement. The scope of the Accounting
Firm's review shall be limited to only those matters which remain in dispute and
which were properly included in such Notice of Disagreement. Seller and Buyer
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within 45 days of the
receipt of such submission. Seller and Buyer agree that judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The
Accounting Firm's determination shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
Accounting Firm that it reached its decision in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 2.02(a). The cost of any arbitration (including the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm) with respect to any Notice of Disagreement
pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm with
respect to such Notice of Disagreement, which proportionate allocation also
shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matter submitted.

            (b) (i) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which
Closing Working Capital exceeds $164,900,000 (the "W.C. AMOUNT"), and the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which Closing Working Capital
is less than the W.C. AMOUNT (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "ADJUSTED CLOSING DATE AMOUNT"). If the
Closing Date Amount is less than the Adjusted Closing Date Amount, Buyer shall,
and if the Closing Date Amount is greater than the Adjusted Closing Date Amount,
Seller shall, within 10 business days after the Working Capital Statement
becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in
immediately available funds of the amount of such difference, together with
interest thereon accrued from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the
Prime Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02(b), no
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.02(b) shall be made
unless such adjustment (whether an increase or a decrease) would exceed
$12,500,000, and if the adjustment would exceed such amount, then the full
amount of the adjustment shall be made.

            (ii) The term "WORKING CAPITAL" shall mean Current Assets minus
Current Liabilities. The W.C. Amount equals Working Capital on December 31,
2000, as reflected in the Clairol Balance Sheet, the Boclaro Working Capital
Statement and the CMO Working Capital Statement, and shall not be subject to
change regardless of whether the items included therein were in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles or the Seller Accounting Policies. The
term "CURRENT ASSETS" shall mean the combined net account receivables, net
inventory and prepaid and other current assets of the Acquired Business, all
calculated (A) in accordance with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Accounting
Policies and Procedures previously delivered to Buyer and in effect as of
December 31, 2000, (B) to give effect to the requirements of Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-14 "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" and (C)
otherwise in conformity with the basis of presentation described in the notes to
the Financial Statements (clauses (A), (B) and (C), collectively, the "SELLER
ACCOUNTING POLICIES"). The term "CURRENT LIABILITIES" shall mean the sum of (x)
combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities of the Acquired Business
(other than the CMO) and (y)(1) the sum of 50% of combined accounts payable and
accrued liabilities of the CMO other than brokers' commissions and (2) all
brokers' commissions related to Clairol included in combined accounts payable of
the CMO, all calculated in accordance with the Seller Accounting Policies. For
the avoidance of doubt, current

                                                                              10


assets and current liabilities relating to cash and cash equivalents, Taxes,
deferred Tax assets and deferred Tax liabilities, intercompany transactions, any
other Excluded Assets and any other Excluded Liabilities are not included in the
Clairol Balance Sheet, the Boclaro Working Capital Statement or the CMO Working
Capital Statement shall not be taken into account in determining Working
Capital. Items for which Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Clairol
Entities and any Buyer Subsidiaries that acquire Acquired Assets or assume
Assumed Liabilities) are indemnified by Seller pursuant to Article XI shall not
be taken into account in determining Working Capital. The parties agree that the
adjustment contemplated by Section 2.02(b) is intended to show the change in
Working Capital from December 31, 2000, to the Closing Date and that such change
can only be measured if the calculation is done in the same way, using the
Seller Accounting Policies at both dates.

            (c) The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm
is limited to whether such calculations were done in accordance with Section
2.02(b), including whether the calculations were in compliance with Seller
Accounting Policies and whether there were mathematical errors in the Statement,
and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Seller Accounting Policies are in accordance
with GAAP or whether GAAP was followed for the Statement or as to whether the
W.C. Amount is correct. Any items on or omissions from the Clairol Balance
Sheet, the Boclaro Working Capital Statement or the CMO Working Capital
Statement that are based upon errors of fact or mathematical errors or that are
not in accordance with the Seller Accounting Policies shall be carried forward
for purposes of calculating Closing Working Capital, as applicable.

            (d) Until the later to occur of (i) the date on which the Statement
shall become final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii)
and (ii) the date on which the Assumed Liabilities Statement (as defined in the
CMO Transitional Services Agreement) shall become final and binding on the
parties pursuant to Section 5.03 of the CMO Transitional Services Agreement,
Buyer agrees that following the Closing it shall not take any actions with
respect to the accounting books and records of Clairol on which the Statement is
to be based that are not consistent with the Acquired Business' past practices
except to the extent that such changes are, in the written opinion of outside
counsel, necessary to comply with Applicable Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no changes shall be made during such period in any
reserve or other account existing as of December 31, 2000, except as a result of
events occurring after December 31, 2000 and, in such event, only in a manner
consistent with past practices.

            (e) Until the later to occur of (i) the date on which the Statement
shall become final and binding on the parties pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii)
and (ii) the date on which the Assumed Liabilities Statement (as defined in the
CMO Transitional Services Agreement) shall become final and binding on the
parties pursuant to Section 5.03 of the CMO Transitional Services Agreement,
Buyer agrees that following the Closing it shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Business (including the Clairol Entities and any Buyer Subsidiaries that acquire
Acquired Assets or assume Assumed Liabilities) to, afford to Seller and any
accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained by Seller in connection with
any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2.02 and the
calculation of each of the BMS Division's Allocable Portion of the CMO Accounts
Payable and Accrued Liabilities reasonable access upon reasonable notice during
normal business hours to the properties, books, contracts, personnel and records
of the Acquired Business (including the Clairol Entities and any Buyer
Subsidiaries that acquire Acquired Assets or assume Assumed Liabilities) and
Buyer's and its accountant's work papers relating to the Statement and the
Assumed Liabilities Statement relevant to the adjustment contemplated by this
Section 2.02 and the calculation of each of the BMS Division's Allocable Portion
of the CMO Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities and shall provide Seller
upon Seller's reasonable request and at Seller's expense, with copies of any
such books, contracts and records, including Buyer's and its accountants, work
papers relating to the Statement.

                                   ARTICLE III

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

            SECTION 3.01. BUYER'S OBLIGATION. The obligation of Buyer to
purchase and pay for the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and the
Acquired Assets and to assume the Assumed Liabilities is subject to the
satisfaction (or written waiver by Buyer) as of the Closing of the following
conditions:

            (a) (i) The representations and warranties of Seller made in this
      Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
      the date hereof, except to the extent such representations and warranties
      expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations
      and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and
      as of such earlier date) and (ii) the representations and

                                                                              12


      warranties of Seller made in Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06,
      4.07, 4.08, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.14 shall be true and correct in all material
      respects as of the date hereof and as of the time of the Closing as though
      made as of such time, except to the extent such representations and
      warranties expressly relate to an earlier date (in which case such
      representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
      respects, on and as of such earlier date), in each case in clauses (i) and
      (ii) except for breaches as to matters that, individually or in the

      Effect. Seller shall have performed or complied in all material respects
      with all obligations and covenants required by this Agreement to be
      performed or complied with by Seller by the time of the Closing; PROVIDED,
      HOWEVER, that for purposes of this condition each of the covenants in
      Section 5.02 with respect to the conduct by Seller of the Acquired
      Business from the date hereof to the Closing that are qualified by
      references to the phrase "consistent with past practice" shall be read as
      if such phrase were deleted from such covenants. Seller shall have
      delivered to Buyer a certificate dated the Closing Date and signed by an
      authorized officer of Seller confirming the foregoing.

            (b) No statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, temporary
      restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
      enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any Federal, state,

      administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
      instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"), or other
      legal restraint or prohibition shall be in effect preventing (i) the
      purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares or (ii) prior to the Twelve Month
      Anniversary, the purchase or sale of any portion of the International
      Shares or any portion of the Acquired Assets or the assumption of any
      portion of the Assumed Liabilities, to the extent the exclusion of such
      portion of the International Shares, Acquired Assets or Assumed
      Liabilities would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR ACT"), the Mexican Federal Economic

      does not oppose the Transaction and will not make an application under
      Section 92 or any other section of the Competition Act in relation to the
      Transaction. Any consents, authorizations, orders, approvals, declarations
      and filings under the HSR Act, the Mexican Merger Regulation, the Canada
      Competition Act or any other applicable antitrust law, the absence of
      which would prohibit the consummation of (i) the purchase and sale of the
      Clairol Shares or (ii) the purchase and sale of any portion of the
      International Shares or any portion of the Acquired Assets, or the
      assumption of any portion of the Assumed Liabilities, to the extent the
      exclusion of such portion of the International Shares, Acquired Assets or
      Assumed Liabilities would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
      Effect, shall have been made or obtained.

            (ii) The Office of Fair Trading shall have indicated, in terms and a
      form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that it is not the intention of the
      Secretary of the State for Trade and Industry to refer the proposed
      acquisition of the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and the
      Acquired Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, or any
      matter arising therefrom, to the Competition Commission; and/or if the
      Secretary of the State for Trade and Industry makes a reference to the
      Competition Commission, either:

                  (A) the Competition Commission has concluded, in terms and a
            form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that neither the acquisition
            of the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and the Acquired
            Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, nor any matter
            arising therefrom, may be expected to operate against the public
            interest; and/or

                  (B) the Secretary of the State for Trade and Industry allowing
            the acquisition of the Clairol Shares, the International Shares and
            the Acquired Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities to
            proceed on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.

            Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, on and after
      the Twelve Month Anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the conditions
      set forth in Section 3.01(b)(ii) and Section 3.01(c) shall cease to be
      conditions to Buyer's obligation to purchase and pay for the Clairol
      Shares, the International Shares and the Acquired Assets and to assume the
      Assumed Liabilities.

            (d) Seller shall have executed and delivered, or shall have caused
      its Affiliates named as parties to any Transaction Document other than
      this Agreement (the "OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS") to execute and deliver,
      the Other Transaction Documents.

            SECTION 3.02. SELLER'S OBLIGATION. The obligation of Seller to sell
and deliver the Clairol Shares, the International Shares, the Acquired Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities to Buyer is subject to the satisfaction (or written
waiver by Seller) as of the Closing of the following conditions:

            (a) The representations and warranties of Buyer made in this
      Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects, as of the
      date hereof and as of the time of the Closing as though made as of such
      time, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly
      relate to an earlier date (in which case such representations and
      warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects, on and as
      of such earlier date), in each case except for breaches as to matters
      that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
      have a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the
      transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer shall have performed or complied
      in all material respects with all obligations and covenants required by
      this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Buyer by the time of
      the Closing. Buyer shall have delivered to Seller a certificate dated the
      Closing Date and signed by an authorized officer of Buyer confirming the
      foregoing.

            (b) No statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, temporary

                                                                              15


      material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired Business or
      any portion of the Acquired Assets material, individually or in the
      aggregate, to the Acquired Business or the assumption of any portion of
      the Assumed Liabilities material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
      Acquired Business.

            (c) The waiting period under the HSR Act, the Mexican Merger
      Regulation and the Canada Competition Act and the merger control act in
      the United Kingdom or any other antitrust law, if applicable to the
      Transaction, shall have expired or been terminated. Any consents,
      authorizations, orders, approvals, declarations and filings under the HSR
      Act, the Mexican Merger Regulation, the Canada Competition Act or any
      other applicable antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the
      consummation of (i) the purchase of the Clairol Shares or (ii) the
      purchase and sale of any portion of the International Shares material,
      individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired Business or any portion
      of the Acquired Assets material, individually or in the aggregate, to the
      Acquired Business or the assumption of any portion of the Assumed
      Liabilities material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Acquired
      Business, shall have been made or obtained.

            (d) Buyer shall have executed and delivered, or shall have caused
      its Affiliates named as parties to any Other Transaction Document to

            SECTION 3.03. FRUSTRATION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS. Neither Buyer nor
Seller may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 3.01 or
3.02, respectively, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's
failure to act in good faith or to use its best efforts to cause the Closing to
occur, as required by Section 8.04.

<Page>
                                                                              18

requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Clairol Shares, upon
delivery to Buyer at the Closing of certificates representing the Clairol
Shares, duly endorsed by Seller for transfer to Buyer, and upon Seller's receipt
of the Closing Date Amount (including any interest payable on the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 1.01(a)), good and valid title to the Clairol Shares will
pass to Buyer, free and clear of any Liens, other than those arising from acts
of Buyer or its Affiliates. Other than this Agreement, the Clairol Shares are
not subject to any voting trust agreement or other contract, agreement,
arrangement, commitment or understanding, including any such agreement,
arrangement, preemptive rights, commitment or understanding restricting or
otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or disposition of the Clairol
Shares.

            (b) Each International Stock Selling Entity has good and valid title
to the International Shares corresponding to its applicable International
Clairol Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens. Assuming Buyer or its
designated Buyer Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority to be the

jurisdiction, and upon Seller's receipt of the Closing Date Amount (including

possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, other than such
franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggre gate, would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and each of the Clairol
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing to do business as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing or holding of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has prior to the Closing Date
delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of the organizational documents,
each as amended to the date hereof, of the Company, and the Clairol
Subsidiaries.

            SECTION 4.05. CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY. The authorized capital
stock of the Company consists of 200,000 shares of common stock, $10 par value
per share. Of such 200,000 duly authorized shares, 100,000 shares (constituting
the Clairol Shares) are validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable. Seller is the record and beneficial owner of the Clairol Shares.
Except for the Clairol Shares, there are no shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of the Company outstanding. The Clairol Shares have not been
issued in violation of, and are not subject to, any preemptive, subscription or
similar rights under any provision of applicable law, the Certificate of

to which the Company is subject, bound or a party or otherwise. There are no
outstanding warrants, options, rights, "phantom" stock rights, agreements,
convertible or exchangeable securities or other commitments (other than this
Agreement) (a) pursuant to which Seller or the Company is or may become
obligated to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem any shares of capital stock
or other securities of the Company or (b) that give any person the right to
receive any benefits or rights similar to any rights enjoyed by or accruing to
the holders of shares of capital stock of the Company. There are no equity
securities of the Company reserved for issuance for any purpose. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to

of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, are as of the date of this Agreement owned by
the applicable International Stock Selling Entity or International Stock Selling
Entities, free and clear of all Liens.

            (c) None of the outstanding shares of capital stock of any U.S.
Clairol Subsidiary or any International Clairol Subsidiary have been issued in
violation of, and is subject to, any preemptive, subscription or similar rights
under any provision of Applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws of such Subsidiary, any contract, agreement or instrument to which such
Subsidiary is subject, bound or a party or otherwise. There are no outstanding
warrants, options, rights, "phantom" stock rights, agreements, convertible or

do not include any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest,
joint venture interest or other equity interest with a net book value as of the

            (c) Except for matters that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) all contributions to, and payments from, the
Benefit Plans that have been required to be made in accordance with the Benefit
Plans and, when applicable, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
have been timely made, (ii) there has been no application for or waiver of the
minimum funding standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code with respect to any
Pension Plan and (iii) no Pension Plan has an "ACCUMULATED FUNDING DEFICIENCY"

year.

            (d) All Pension Plans that are intended to qualify under Section

exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively,
of the Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked nor, to the
knowledge of Seller, has revocation been threatened, nor has any such Pension
Plan been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect that is reasonably expected to adversely
affect its qualification or materially increase its cost.

reported to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation by law or regulation; and
(iii) to the knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor any trustee, administrator
or other fiduciary of any Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing has
engaged in any transaction or acted or failed to act in a manner that is
reasonably expected to subject the Company or the U.S. Clairol Subsidiaries to
any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other
applicable law.

            (f) Except for amounts that would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA (including for the purposes of this Section 4.14(f) any Pension Plan
maintained or contributed to by Seller or any other person required to be
treated as a single employer with Seller under Section 414 of the Code), Seller
has not incurred any material liability to such Pension Plan or to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, other than for the payment of contributions or
premiums. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer the most recent
actuarial report or valuation with respect to each Pension Plan that is a

plan.

Material Adverse Effect, each Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, as such
term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code, complies in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

Acquired Business other than changes relating to United States or foreign
economies in general or the Acquired Business's industries in general and not

of the execution and public announcement of this Agreement and the Other

terms of a confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Seller dated December 13,
2000 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating
solely to the Acquired Business PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer acknowledges that
any and all other information not related to the Acquired Business provided to
it by Seller or Seller's representatives concerning Seller, the Seller Entities
or any other Affiliate of Seller shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

            SECTION 7.02. NO ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS. Buyer acknowledges that
none of Seller, any of its Affiliates (including any Seller Entity or any

shall Buyer, any Buyer Subsidiary or any Clairol Entity use any BMS Names after
the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such BMS
Names by Seller, the Seller Entities and the Clairol Entities during the 90-day
period preceding the Closing. With respect to product inventory manufactured

Squibb Company", any variations and derivatives thereof and all other logos or
trademarks of Seller or its Affiliates not included in Section 4.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.

            SECTION 7.04. BUYER ACTIVITY ON CLOSING DATE. On the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to,
conduct the Acquired Business in the ordinary course in substantially the same
manner as presently conducted and, on the Closing Date, shall not permit any
Buyer Subsidiary or any Clairol Entity to effect any extraordinary transactions
(other than any such transactions expressly required by Applicable Law or by
this Agreement) that could result in Tax liability to Seller, a Seller Entity or
a Clairol Entity in excess of Tax liability associated with the conduct of their
business in the ordinary course.

            SECTION 7.05. SECURITIES ACT. Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries shall
not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of the Clairol Shares or the
International Shares so acquired by it or them in violation of any of the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

AGREEMENT"), by and between the Seller and Lion Corporation ("LION"), which

products (the "COVERED PRODUCTS") in Japan. Buyer agrees not to, and agrees to
cause any purchaser or transferee of the Acquired Business or rights with
respect to the Covered Products to agree not to, directly or indirectly,
manufacture, market or sell Covered Products in Japan. Buyer shall have no
liability to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.07 if, through no fault or
knowledge of Buyer, a third party unaffiliated with Buyer sells any Covered
Products in the Japanese market; PROVIDED that if Buyer learns of such diversion
of Covered Products into the Japanese market by a third party, Buyer shall use
its best efforts to cease selling Covered Products to such third party.

            SECTION 7.08. CERTAIN ACTIONS. Buyer agrees not to take any of the
actions set forth in Schedule I.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                MUTUAL COVENANTS

            Each of Seller and Buyer covenants and agrees as follows:

            SECTION 8.01. CONSENTS. Buyer acknowledges that consents and waivers
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Other
Transaction Documents may be required from parties to contracts that are
Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities, or contracts to which a Clairol Entity
is a party, including the Contracts listed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "TRANSFERRED CONTRACTS") or with respect to environmental
permits or other assets and that such consents and waivers have not been
obtained. Buyer agrees that Seller shall not have any liability whatsoever to
Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or
waivers that may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or because of the termination of any Transferred Contract as a
result thereof. Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty or
covenant of Seller contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to
obtain any such consent or waiver, (b) any such termination or (c) any lawsuit,
action, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of
any person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such consent
or any such termination.

                                                                              50


Prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all such consents and waivers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such efforts
shall not include any requirement of Seller or any of its Affiliates to expend
money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation, incur any obligation
in favor of, or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to,
any third party, and all costs and expenses related to seeking and obtaining
such consents and waivers shall be for Buyer's account.

            SECTION 8.02. COOPERATION. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with
each other, and shall cause their officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to cooperate with each other, for a period of 60 days after the
Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the Acquired Business from Seller to
Buyer and to minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of Seller,
Buyer and the Acquired Business, that might result from the transactions
contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer
and Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
employees, counsel, auditors and representatives access, during normal business
hours, to such information and assistance relating to the Acquired Business as
is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting matters, the
preparation and filing of any Tax returns, reports or forms or the defense of
any Tax claim or assessment. The obligation to cooperate pursuant to the
preceding sentence insofar as it concerns Taxes shall terminate at the time the
relevant applicable statute of limitations expires (giving effect to any
extension thereof). Each party shall reimburse the other for reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting the other pursuant to
this Section 8.02. Neither party shall be required by this Section 8.02 to take
any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business or
unreasonably disrupt its normal operations (or, in the case of Buyer, the
Acquired Business).

            SECTION 8.03. PUBLICITY. Seller and Buyer agree that, from the date
hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by either party without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the
rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance.

without limiting the requirements for Closing set forth in Section 2.01(a),
Buyer and Seller shall use their respective best efforts to cause the Closing to

thereafter. Except as expressly provided in Section 8.05(c), each of Seller and
Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective Affiliates to,
take any action that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in
any of the conditions to the purchase and sale of the Clairol Shares, the
International Shares and the Acquired Assets and the assignment and assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities set forth in Article III not being satisfied

            (b) Except as expressly provided in Section 8.05(c), Buyer shall use
its best efforts to have any restraint or prohibition of the type described in
clause (z) of the proviso to Section 2.01(a)(ii) terminated as promptly as

interest on the Purchase Price after the Six Month Anniversary pursuant to
Section 1.01(a), (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.01(d) and
(iii) receive the payment specified in Section 13.03 upon a termination pursuant
to Section 13.01(d), do not, in any manner, reduce, lessen, alter, modify or
otherwise change Buyer's obligations under this Section 8.04 to use its best
efforts to cause the Closing to occur (including its obligation to use best
efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to the Six Month Anniversary
or as soon as practicable thereafter) or to cause any restraint or prohibition
of the type described in clause (z) of the proviso to Section 2.01(a)(ii) to be
lifted or terminated.

            SECTION 8.05. ANTITRUST NOTIFICATION AND OTHER REGULATORY FILINGS.

later than five business days following the execution and delivery of this

shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may

<Page>
                                                                              52

necessary under the HSR Act. Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of
the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply with any such
inquiry or request as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five
business days after receipt of such inquiry or request. Any such notification
and report form and supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Seller and Buyer shall use its
best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the
Transaction.

            (b) Seller and Buyer shall make any required regulatory filings, and
shall use their best efforts to obtain any required regulatory consents,
authorizations, orders, approvals and declarations outside the United States, in
each case as promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, including filings under the Mexican Merger Regulation, the Canada
Competition Act and the merger control acts in the United Kingdom and Germany
and the Irish Mergers Act.

            (c) Seller and Buyer shall further use their best efforts to (i) if
and to the extent Buyer so elects, contest any Antitrust Proceeding until each
such Antitrust Proceeding is either resolved pursuant to a final nonappealable
court order or Buyer has determined not to further contest such Antitrust
Proceeding and (ii) once all such Antitrust Proceedings are so resolved or
abandoned by Buyer, take such actions as may be necessary to resolve any
objections as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity to obtain all necessary
clearances and approvals under the U.S. Antitrust Laws. Subject to Buyer's
obligations pursuant to Section 8.05(a) to keep Seller apprised of the status of
the regulatory process, Buyer shall control the regulatory process to obtain all
such clearances and consents under the U.S. Antitrust Laws (including all
Antitrust Proceedings), subject to Seller's right to participate therein. Seller
shall not have independent substantive contacts with any Governmental Entities
administering the U.S. Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (unless Seller is otherwise advised by its counsel that it
is advisable for Seller to do so).

Transaction and any other required regulatory consents, authorizations, orders,
approvals and declarations outside the United States.

            SECTION 8.06. RECORDS. As soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all
Records, if any, in the possession of Seller and its Affiliates relating to the
Acquired Business to the extent not then in the possession of the Clairol
Entities, subject to the following exceptions:

            (i) Buyer recognizes that certain Records may contain incidental
      information relating to the Acquired Business or may relate primarily to
      subsidiaries or divisions of Seller other than the Acquired Business and
      that Seller may retain such Records and shall provide copies of the
      relevant portions thereof to Buyer;

            (ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the

                                                                              56


            (d) Seller has provided to Buyer a list (by name or by category and

collective bargaining or labor agreements with respect to Employees previously
disclosed to Buyer (collectively, the "COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS"), and
shall assume all liabilities and obligations under the Collective Bargaining
Agreements arising under, INTER ALIA, the terms of the Collective Bargaining
Agreements, the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor Management Relations Act
and all other laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which
Employees are employed, and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability in
connection with the Collective Bargaining Agreements with respect to Employees
and their beneficiaries.

            SECTION 9.03. CONTINUITY OF EMPLOYMENT. (a) Buyer and Seller intend
that there shall be continuity of employment with respect to all Employees as of
the Closing Date. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries to, offer
employment to each Employee as of the Closing Date, or, as applicable, shall
cause the Clairol Entity that presently employs each Employee to continue the
Employee's employment as of the Closing Date, in all cases on substantially the
same terms and conditions as are applicable to such Employees immediately before
the Closing Date.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as
of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause, the Buyer Subsidiaries and the
Clairol Entities to, continue the employment of Employees based in locations

similar law in the relevant jurisdiction, and shall grant for a period of not
less than that provided for by local country law, substantially the same terms
and

                                                                              57

Member States relating to the Safeguarding of Employee's Rights in the Event of
Transfers of Undertakings, Business or Parts of Businesses" (77/187/EC), as
amended, and its subsequent transposition into local laws. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol
Entities to, offer and continue the employment of the Employees on the same
terms and conditions as in effect before the Closing Date, where necessary to
avoid the imposition of severance or similar obligations on Seller or its
Affiliates or where otherwise required by law.

            (c) For not less than 18 months following the Closing Date (the
"CONTINUATION PERIOD"), Buyer shall maintain, or, where applicable, shall cause
the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to maintain (to the extent
permitted by law), compensation arrangements, employee benefit plans, and
perquisites with respect to Employees that are comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Employees by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior
to the Closing Date. In the alternative, during the Continuation Period, Buyer
may replace or, where applicable, cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol
Entities to replace (to the extent permitted by law), Seller's compensation
arrangements, employee benefit plans and perquisites with compensation
arrangements, employee benefit plans and perquisites that are comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries, PROVIDED that Employees shall either be treated entirely
under the first sentence or entirely under the second sentence of this Section
9.03(c). With respect to Buyer's stock-based plans, all Employees in Seller's
grades D-8 and above, and at least 50% of the Employees in Seller's grades D-6
and D-7, shall receive stock awards from Buyer in accordance with this Section
9.03 immediately after the Closing, and Employees' stock awards shall provide
for full vesting upon termination of employment in circumstances that entitle
such Employees to severance benefits under Section 9.08.

            (d) Buyer shall cause Employees' service with Seller and its
Affiliates before the Closing Date to be credited for all purposes for which
such service was recognized by Seller and its Affiliates with respect to all
employee benefit plans and arrangements and employment-

related entitlements provided, maintained or contributed to by Buyer, the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities for Employees on or after the Closing
Date, except as specifically provided otherwise in this Article IX.

            (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the
termination of any Employee's employment or the modification of any benefit
plans and arrangements, consistent with applicable law and the requirements of
Sections 9.03(b) and (c).

            SECTION 9.04. PENSION PLAN. Seller shall retain responsibility for
all benefits accrued before the Closing Date by Employees under the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan (the "Seller's Pension
Plan"), and neither Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries nor any of their Affiliates

are participants in the Seller's Pension Plan shall be immediately eligible on
the Closing Date for participation under the terms of the Procter & Gamble

meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "BUYER'S 401(K) PLAN") and is
intended to be qualified pursuant to Section 401(a) of the Code. Buyer shall
cause Buyer's 401(k) Plan to accept direct rollover contributions (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) of Employee account balances which are made in the form of cash
and/or outstanding Employee loan balances from the Bristol- Myers Squibb Company
Savings and Investment Program (the "SELLER'S 401(K) PLAN"). Employees shall
have a fully vested interest in their accounts under the Seller's 401(k) Plan,
and in any accounts transferred to the Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Neither Buyer, the
Buyer Subsidiaries, Buyer's 401(k) Plan nor any of their Affiliates shall have
or assume any liability in connection with Seller's 401(k) Plan (except

                                                                              59

            (b) The non-qualified defined contribution plans of Buyer, the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities ("BUYER'S BEP-SIP") shall provide those
Employees who are participating before the Closing Date in the Benefits
Equalization Plan of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its Subsidiary or
Affiliated Corporations Participating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
Savings and Investment Program ("SELLER'S BEP-SIP") with an account balance
under Buyer's BEP-SIP equal to the Employees' account balance under Seller's
BEP-SIP as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer
Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, assume and be responsible for paying
all benefits accrued by Employees under Seller's BEP-SIP before the Closing
Date.

            (c) Seller shall retain responsibility for all benefits accrued

Participating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan or the

BEP-RIP") and (ii) Seller's Key International Pension Plan ("SELLER'S KIP").
Neither Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries, the Clairol Entities nor any plan of
Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries, or the Clairol Entities shall have or assume any
liability with respect to Seller's BEP-RIP or Seller's KIP.

            SECTION 9.07. WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) Effective as of the Closing

Section 9.03. All waiting periods and pre-existing condition clauses shall be
waived under the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans for Employees and their eligible
dependents who were participating in the welfare benefits plans and programs of
Seller and its Affiliates ("SELLER WELFARE BENEFIT PLANS") before the Closing
Date. Buyer shall cause the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans to recognize any out-of-
pocket medical and dental expenses incurred by each of the Employees and their
eligible dependents prior to the Closing Date and during the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of determining deductibles and
out-of- pocket maximums under the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans.

such health and dental claims, stock options and restricted stock. In addition,
Buyer shall not be responsible for any dependent life insurance and other
insured benefit claims that are incurred by Employees before the Closing Date,
to the extent that such claims are paid by the insurance carrier to the
Employees according to the terms of the applicable insurance contracts
maintained by Seller.

Welfare Benefit Plans to each Employee who retires on or after the Closing Date

and coverage that are comparable in the aggregate to those set forth in the
Comprehensive Medical Plan Summary Plan Description for Retirees of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or such other retiree benefit plan or arrangement
of Seller or its Affiliates that is applicable to the Employee immediately
before the Closing Date (or that would have been applicable had the Employee
been eligible to retire immediately before the Closing Date), in accordance with
Section 9.03. If Employees are eligible to receive health care benefits under
Seller's retiree plans on or after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that Seller's
retiree plans shall be secondary to the Buyer Welfare Benefit Plans (both active
and retiree plans).

            (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, have in effect a health care

made under the health care and dependent care reimbursement account plans of
Seller and its Affiliates as in effect on the Closing Date (the "Seller

Employee accounts under the Buyer Reimbursement Plan that relate to the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs.

            (e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, assume all responsibilities
and obligations for continuation coverage under Sections 601 ET SEQ. of ERISA

Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to, adopt and maintain, effective as of
the Closing Date, one or more severance policies which shall be identical in all
material respects (including the Rule of 70 provisions, as described in Seller's
written communications to Employees) to the terms of the severance policies of
Seller and its Affiliates applicable to Employees as in effect on the Closing
Date (the "SELLER SEVERANCE POLICIES") and which shall be enhanced as described
in Exhibit N (the "ENHANCED SEVERANCE PROGRAM"). Buyer shall cause the Enhanced
Severance Program to be maintained for Employees whose employment terminates on
or after the Closing Date and during the Continuation Period. Buyer and the

Employees on or after the Closing Date.

            SECTION 9.10. RELOCATION BENEFITS. As of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and the Clairol Entities to,

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            SECTION 11.01. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Seller shall indemnify Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities) and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and
hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Clairol Entities and
Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (including
any U.S. federal income Taxes imposed on the Company or the U.S. Clairol
Subsidiaries as a result of the Code Section 338(h)(10) election contemplated by
Section 12.04 of this Agreement), (ii) all liability for Taxes of the Clairol

as a result of Treasury Regulation ss. 1.1502-6(a) for Taxes of Seller or any
other corporation which is or has been affiliated with Seller (other than the
Clairol Entities). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities) and each
of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents, from any liability
for Taxes attributable to any action taken on or after the Closing Date by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including the Clairol Entities), or any transferee
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than any such action expressly required
by Applicable Law or by this Agreement) (a "BUYER TAX ACT") or attributable to a
breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and Clairol
Entities to, indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives and
hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Clairol Entities and
Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date (except to the extent such taxable period began before the Closing

Taxes that are not for the Pre-Closing Tax Period) and (ii) all liability for
Taxes attributable to a Buyer Tax Act or to a breach by Buyer of its obligations
under this Agreement.

                                                                              65


            (c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"):

            (i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("PROPERTY TAXES")
      of the Clairol Entities and Property Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets
      allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
      such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
      fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
      Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which
      is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and

            (ii) the Taxes of the Clairol Entities and Taxes relating to the
      Acquired Assets (other than Property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Closing
      Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the
      close of business on the Closing Date.

            SECTION 11.02. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER. (a) Except as
relates to Taxes, for which the sole indemnification is provided in Section
11.01, Seller shall indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Clairol
Entities) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives against and hold them harmless from any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent
arising from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, in
each case, which survives the Closing, (ii) any breach of any covenant of Seller
contained in this Agreement or any Other Transaction Document, (iii) any failure
of Seller to perform or satisfy any employee benefit obligations or liabilities
specifically retained by Seller under Article IX, (iv) all Excluded Liabilities
or (v) any breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Agreements set forth
in Section 11.02(a)(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) or clause
(ii) of this Section 11.02(a) (in the case of clause (ii), only with respect to
breaches of covenants that occur prior to Closing) unless the aggregate of all
losses, liabilities, costs and expenses relating thereto for which Seller would,
but for this clause (A), be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal
to 1% of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent of any such excess; (B)
Seller shall not have any liability under clause (i) or clause (ii) of this
Section 11.02(a) (in the case of clause (ii), only with respect to breaches of
covenants that occur prior to Closing) for any individual item or series of
related items where the loss, liability, cost or expense relating thereto is
less than $250,000 and such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of the
foregoing clause (A) of this Section 11.02(a); (C) Seller's liability under
clause (i) or clause (ii) of this

<Page>
                                                                              66


Section 11.02(a) (in the case of clause (ii), only with respect to breaches of
covenants that occur prior to Closing) shall in no event exceed 20% of the
Purchase Price; and (D) Seller shall not have any liability under this Section
11.02(a) to the extent the liability or obligation arises as a result of any
action taken or omitted to be taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations of clauses (A), (B) and (C) of
the preceding sentence shall not apply to any employee benefit obligations or
liabilities specifically retained by Seller pursuant to the provisions of
Article IX or any Excluded Liabilities. In no event shall Seller be obligated to
indemnify Buyer or any other person with respect to any matter to the extent
that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the
Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to Section 2.02.

            (b) Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing
occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating
to this Agreement, any Other Transaction Document, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Clairol Shares, the International Shares, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Clairol Entities or their respective assets, liabilities and
business (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) or any
Federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or
otherwise, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article XI. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) it or any of its Affiliates (including the Clairol
Entities) may have against Seller and its Affiliates arising under or based upon
this Agreement, any Other Transaction Document, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, or any Federal, state, local or foreign
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XI).

            SECTION 11.03. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Except as relates to
Taxes, for which the sole indemnification is provided in Section 11.01, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Buyer Subsidiaries and Clairol Entities to, indemnify
Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, agents and representatives against and hold them
harmless from any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) suffered or incurred by any such indemnified
party to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto, in each case, which survives the Closing, (ii) any breach of
any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Other Transaction
Document, (iii) any guarantee or obligation or liability given or made by Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller with respect to any obligation or any Assumed
Liability set forth in clause (iv),(v) or (vi) below (each, a "SELLER
GUARANTEE"), (iv) all Assumed Liabilities, (v) any obligations assumed or
retained by Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries or the Clairol Entities pursuant to
Article IX, (vi) all obligations and liabilities of whatever kind and nature,
primary or secondary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, known or
unknown, whether or not accrued, whether arising before, on or after the Closing
Date, of the Clairol Entities, including any such obligations or liabilities
under any agreement, lease, license, permit, plan or commitment to which any
Clairol Entity is a party or by which any Clairol Entity or any of its
properties or assets are bound or the Benefit Plans set forth in Section 4.14 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any plan, fund, program, policy, contract or
arrangement described in Section 4.14 but not required to be set forth in
Section 4.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "PLANS") (in
each case other than items for which indemnification is provided under Section
11.02), (vii) any discontinuance, suspension or modification on or after the
Closing Date of any Plan and (viii) any claim that the purchase and sale of the
Clairol Shares, the International Shares, the Acquired Assets or the
transactions contemplated hereby give rise to any severance or other benefits
under any Plan.

            SECTION 11.04. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY; COOPERATION. (a)
Notwithstanding any provision herein, neither Seller nor Buyer shall in any
event be liable to the other party or its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, agents or representatives on account of any indemnity
obligation set forth in Section 11.02 or 11.03 for any indirect, consequential,

<Page>
                                                                              68


special, incidental or punitive damages (including, but not limited to, lost
profits, loss of use, damage to goodwill or loss of business).

            (b) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to
indemnify the other party hereunder including by making commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

            SECTION 11.05. LOSSES NET OF INSURANCE, ETC. The amount of any loss,
liability, claim, damage, expense or Tax for which indemnification is provided
under this Article XI shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by
the indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to such loss,
liability, claim, damage, expense or Tax (collectively, a "LOSS") and shall be
reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit (including as a result of any
basis adjustment) of the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, the
indemnified party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt
of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any
indemnified Loss. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or successor
form) with respect to the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates causes any
such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for United
States Federal income Tax purposes.

            SECTION 11.06. TERMINATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto (a) pursuant to Section 11.01, shall
terminate at the time the applicable statutes of limitation with respect to the
Tax liabilities in question expire (giving effect to any extension thereof), (b)
pursuant to Sections 11.02(a)(i) and 11.03(i), shall terminate when the
applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Article XIV and (c)
pursuant to Sections 11.02(a)(ii) and 11.03(ii), in each case with respect to
breaches of covenants that occur prior to the Closing, shall terminate eighteen
months after the Closing Date and (d) pursuant to the other clauses of Sections
11.02 and 11.03 shall not terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that as to clauses (a),
(b) and (c) above such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to

<Page>
                                                                              69


be indemnified or the related party thereto shall have, before the expiration of
the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such
claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the indemnifying
party.

            SECTION 11.07. PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR THIRD
PARTY CLAIMS. In order for a party (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this Agreement (other than
indemnification for a Tax Claim under Section 11.01 which shall be governed by
Section 11.09) in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made
by any person against the indemnified party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), such
indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim within 10 business days after
receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the
period in which the indemnified party failed to give such notice). Thereafter,
the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly after
the indemnified party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the Third
Party Claim.

            If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemni fied party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it so chooses and acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the indemnified
party therefor, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such counsel is not reasonably
objected to by the indemnified party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to the indemnified party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless the indemnified
party retains its own counsel due to a mutually agreed upon conflict of
interest. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel
(not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being

<Page>
                                                                              70


understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying party has
failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during the period prior to the
time the indemnified party shall have given notice of the Third Party Claim as
provided above).

            If the indemnifying party so elects to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim, all of the indemnified parties shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the provision
to the indemnifying party of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

            SECTION 11.08. PROCEDURES RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION FOR OTHER
CLAIMS (OTHER THAN TAX CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.01). In the event any indemnified
party should have a claim against any indemnifying party under Section 11.02 or
11.03 that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought
to be collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver
notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. The
failure by any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such
indemnified party under Section 11.02 or 11.03, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such
failure.

            SECTION 11.09. PROCEDURES RELATING TO INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS.
(a) If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section
11.01 (the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), and the other party to this Agreement (the
"TAX INDEMNIFIED PARTY") receives notice of any deficiency, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM")
with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. If notice of a Tax

<Page>
                                                                              71


Claim is not given to the Tax Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period of
time to allow such party effectively to contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable
detail to apprise such party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in each case taking
into account the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax Claim, the Tax
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party (or, any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives) to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying
Party position is materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

            (b) With respect to any Tax Claim, for which the Tax Indemnified
Party has not waived its rights to indemnification for Taxes under this
Agreement, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and control all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any
and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
taxing authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either
pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such
refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the case of a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes with respect
to any Clairol Entity for a Straddle Period, Seller and Buyer shall jointly
control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Claim.

            (c) The Tax Indemnified Party and each of its respective Affiliates
shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in contesting any Tax Claim,
which cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Tax Indemnifying
Party's request) the provision to the Tax Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at
proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

            (d) In no case shall Buyer, the Buyer Subsidiaries, the Clairol
Entities or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives settle or otherwise compromise any Tax
Claim without Seller's prior written consent. Neither party shall settle a Tax
Claim relating solely to Taxes of the Company or the Clairol Subsidiaries for a
Straddle Period without the other party's prior written consent.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   TAX MATTERS

            SECTION 12.01. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARATION AND FILING OF TAX
RETURNS AND AMENDMENTS. (a) For any taxable period of the Clairol Entities that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, Buyer shall timely prepare and
file with the appropriate authorities all Tax returns, reports and forms
required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such returns,
reports and forms; PROVIDED that Seller shall remit to Buyer not less than ten
(10) days prior to the due date of any such return, report or form any amount
owed by Seller pursuant to Section 11.01 with respect to the taxable periods
covered by such returns, reports or forms. All such returns shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with the past practice of the Clairol Entities and in a
manner that does not distort taxable income provided such basis will not subject
Buyer to any penalties or fines or such basis is otherwise not prohibited by
Applicable Law. Buyer shall furnish such returns to Seller for its approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld) at least 30 days
prior to the due date for filing such returns.

            (b) For any taxable period of the Clairol Entities that ends on or
before the Closing Date, Seller shall timely prepare and file with the
appropriate authorities all Tax returns, reports and forms required to be filed,
and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such returns, reports and forms. To
the extent that they relate to the Clairol Entities, all such returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of Clairol Entities and in
a manner that does not distort taxable income. Buyer and Seller agree to cause
the Clairol Entities to file all Tax returns, reports and forms for the period
including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, unless the relevant taxing
authority will not accept a return, report or form filed on that basis.

            (c) Seller shall be responsible for filing any amended,
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax returns for taxable years ending on or
prior to the Closing Date. For those jurisdictions in which separate Tax returns
are filed by the Company or the Clairol Subsidiaries, any required amended
returns shall be prepared by Seller and furnished to the Company or the Clairol
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for signature and filing at least 30 days
prior to the due date for filing such returns, and the Company or applicable

<Page>
                                                                              73


Clairol Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall promptly sign and timely file any
such amended return.

            SECTION 12.02. COOPERATION. Each of Seller, the Seller Entities, the
Clairol Entities and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all returns, reports and forms
relating to Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Buyer and Seller
recognize that Seller and its Affiliates will need access, from time to time,
after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information
held by the Clairol Entities to the extent such records and information pertain
to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees, and
agrees to cause the Clairol Entities, (a) to use their best efforts to properly
retain and maintain such records until such time as Seller agrees that such
retention and maintenance is no longer necessary, and (b) to allow Seller and
its agents and representatives (and agents or representatives of any of its
Affiliates), at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect,
review and make copies of such records as Seller may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours and at Seller's expense.

            SECTION 12.03. REFUNDS AND CREDITS. Any refunds or credits of Taxes
of the Clairol Entities or Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of Seller.
Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Clairol Entities or Taxes relating to the
Acquired Assets for any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date shall be
for the account of the Buyer. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Clairol
Entities or Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets for any Straddle Period shall
be equitably apportioned between Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall, if Seller so
requests and at Seller's expense, cause the Clairol Entities to file for and
obtain any refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under this Section
12.03. Buyer shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund
claim and, where deemed appropriate by Seller, shall cause the Clairol Entities
to authorize by appropriate powers of attorney such persons as Seller shall
designate to represent the Clairol Entities, as applicable, with respect to such
refund claim, PROVIDED,

<Page>
                                                                              74


HOWEVER, that the prosecution of such could not give rise to Taxes imposed upon
any Buyer Indemnified Person. Buyer shall cause the Clairol Entities to forward
to Seller any such refund to which it is entitled under this Section 12.03
within 10 days after the refund is received (or reimburse Seller for any such
credit within 10 days after the credit is allowed or applied against other Tax
liability); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such amounts payable to Seller shall be
net of any Tax cost or Tax benefit (including as a result of any basis
adjustment) to Buyer or the Clairol Entities, as the case may be, attributable
to the receipt of such refund and/or the payment of such amounts to Seller.
Seller and Buyer shall treat any payments under the preceding sentence that
Seller shall receive pursuant to this Section 12.03 as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, unless a final determination (which shall include the execution
of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for United Stated Federal income Tax purposes. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the control of the prosecution of a claim for refund of Taxes
paid pursuant to a deficiency assessed subsequent to the Closing Date as a
result of an audit shall be governed by the provisions of Section 11.09.

            SECTION 12.04. SECTION 338(h)(10). (a) SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTIONS.
Buyer and Seller shall (i) join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the United States Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "TREASURY REGULATIONS") and any comparable election
under state or local Tax law with respect to Clairol, Inc., any U.S. Clairol
Subsidiaries and U.S. legal entity acquired pursuant to these Transaction
Documents (the "ELECTIONS"), (ii) provide to the other party any information
reasonably requested in reasonable detail by such other party to permit the
Elections to be made, (iii) as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date, take all actions reasonably requested in reasonable detail by the other
party to effect and preserve timely Elections (including filing such forms,
returns, elections, schedules and other documents reasonably requested in
reasonable detail by the other party to effect and preserve timely Elections in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury
Regulations (or any comparable provisions of state or local tax law)) and (iv)
report Buyer's acquisitions pursuant to this Agreement consistent with such
Elections.

                                                                              75


            (b) Section 338(g) ELECTIONS. Buyer and Seller agree that neither
Buyer nor Seller nor any Affiliate of either thereof shall make any election
pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code and the United States Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (or any comparable election under state or
local Tax law) with respect to any International Clairol Subsidiary.

            SECTION 12.05. PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS. (a) ALLOCATIONS OF
PURCHASE PRICE. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no
event later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the last date on which an IRS
Form 8023 ("FORM 8023") can be filed to provide for the Elections) Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer and Seller shall agree on (i) an
allocation of that portion of the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to the
operation of Section 2.02) attributable to the Clairol Shares pursuant to
Section 1.01(d) among the assets of the Company and each U.S. Clairol Subsidiary
and (ii) a completed Form 8023 and the required schedules thereto, providing for
each election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of
the Treasury Regulations.

            (b) ADJUSTMENTS TO PURCHASE PRICE. Buyer and Seller agree that, to
the extent that the Purchase Price is adjusted pursuant to the operation of
Section 2.02, Buyer and Seller, for all Tax purposes (including for purposes of
completing or amending Form 8023), shall allocate such adjustment to the item or
items to which it is principally attributable.

            (c) PARTIES AGREE TO REPORT THE ELECTIONS, PURCHASE PRICE
ALLOCATIONS AND INDEMNITY PAYMENTS CONSISTENTLY. Buyer and Seller agree to file
all Tax returns, reports and forms consistent with the Elections and with the
allocations described in Section 1.01(d) (including the allocations set forth on
Exhibit E) and this Section 12.05 and not to take any position inconsistent
therewith for any Tax purpose, unless required by Applicable Law. In addition,
Buyer and Seller agree to treat any indemnity payment under Article XI as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to the operation of
Section 2.02) for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

            (d) DISPUTES BY TAXING AUTHORITY. In the event that any of the
allocations described in Section 1.01(d) (including the allocations set forth on
Exhibit E) or this Section 12.05 are disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party
receiving notice of such dispute shall promptly notify the other party in
writing of such dispute, and Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith in
responding to such

<Page>
                                                                              76


challenge in order to preserve the effectiveness of such allocation.

            SECTION 12.06. TRANSFER TAXES. All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, value added, registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer or gains Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties,
interest and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby ("TRANSFER TAXES") shall be shared equally
between Seller and Buyer, and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in timely making
all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the
provisions of such Tax laws; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all Transfer Taxes which
are refundable to or otherwise recoverable by Buyer shall be paid solely by
Buyer.

            SECTION 12.07. FIRPTA CERTIFICATE. Seller shall deliver to Buyer at
the Closing a certificate in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, duly
executed and acknowledged, certifying any facts that would exempt the
transactions contemplated hereby from withholding pursuant to the provisions of
the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act.

            SECTION 12.08. BUYER ACTIVITY POST-CLOSING. Buyer shall not, with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (a) file any amended Tax return with
respect to the Clairol Entities; (b) carry back any loss or other Tax attribute
of the Clairol Entities; or (c) take or advocate any position with respect to
Taxes of the Clairol Entities that reasonably could be expected to adversely
affect Seller or that would have the effect of shifting income to a Pre- Closing
Tax Period unless, in each case, Seller shall have consented in writing to such
action by the Buyer.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                   TERMINATION

            SECTION 13.01. TERMINATION. Anything contained herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

            (a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

<Page>
                                                                              77


            (b) by Seller if any of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02
      shall have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived
      by Seller;

            (c) by Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01
      (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 3.01(b) or 3.01(c)) shall
      have become incapable of fulfillment, and shall not have been waived by
      Buyer; or

            (d) by Seller, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to the
      Twelve Month Anniversary of the date of this Agreement;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause (b),
(c) or (d) is not in breach in any material respect of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

            SECTION 13.02. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. If the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein:

            (a) Buyer shall return all documents and other material received
      from Seller, any Seller Entity, any Clairol Entity or any other Affiliate
      of Seller relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so
      obtained before or after the execution hereof, to Seller; and

            (b) all confidential information received by Buyer with respect to
      the businesses of Seller and its Affiliates (including the Clairol
      Entities, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) shall be
      treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
      remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this
      Agreement.

            SECTION 13.03. CONSEQUENCES OF TERMINATION. In the event of
termination by Seller or Buyer pursuant to Article XIII, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given to the other party and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by either party. If
this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are
abandoned as described in this Article XIII, this Agreement shall become void
and of no further force or effect, except for the provisions of (a) Section 7.01
relating to the obligation of Buyer to keep confidential certain information and
