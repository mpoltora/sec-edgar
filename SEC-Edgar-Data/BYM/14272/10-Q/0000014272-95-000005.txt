                   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
             OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
            (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)

Basis of Presentation
- ----------------------

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments
(consisting only of normal adjustments) necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company (the "Company") at March 31, 1995 and December 31, 1994,
the results of operations for the three months ended March 31,
1995 and 1994, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31,
1995 and 1994.  These condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included in the Company's 1994
Annual Report on Form 10-K.


First Quarter Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------

Sales
- -----

Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 1995 increased 16% over
the prior year to $3,301.  The consolidated sales growth resulted
from a 14% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to the
favorable effect of foreign currency translation, and no effect
due to selling prices.  Domestic sales increased 11% and
international sales increased 25% (20% excluding the favorable
effect of foreign currency translation).  All four of the
Company's core businesses had good growth, in both domestic and
international markets.  The three acquisitions made in the last
nine months, Calgon Vestal Laboratories, Matrix Essentials, Inc.
and the UPSA Group, accounted for 6% of the reported 16% increase
for the Company as a whole.  Worldwide sales for the first quarter
of 1994 increased 3% compared to the first quarter of 1993.  In
general, the business of the Company's industry segments is not
seasonal.

quarter of 1994 to $1,895.  Sales growth resulted from a 12%
increase in volume, a 1% decrease in selling prices and a 2%
increase due to the favorable effect of foreign currency
translation.   Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product
group in the segment, increased to $685 from $681 in 1994.  Sales
of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor sold
primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN* and the Company's largest
selling product, were $372 compared to $374 in 1994.  In the U.S.,
the expiration date of the CAPOTEN* patent was redefined by
legislation implementing the GATT treaty to February 1996.  Due to
questions surrounding the implementation of the GATT legislation,
the effect of the new patent expiration date on the Company's
overall performance is currently being evaluated.  In Germany, the
patent expiration for CAPOTEN* occurred in February 1995.
PRAVACHOL*, the Company's cholesterol-lowering agent, contributed
to the increase in cardiovascular sales.  During the first quarter
the Company received regulatory approvals for pravastatin's new
indication in the U.K., France, the Netherlands and New Zealand as
treatment to reduce the incidence of clinical cardiac events and/or
slow the progression of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic
patients.  In the U.S., PRAVACHOL* clinical pharmacology
labeling was changed to reflect a 67% reduction in the incidence of
fatal and non-fatal heart attacks in hypercholesterolemic patients.
Anti-infective drug sales increased 16% to $426 compared to $366 in
1994 due to increased sales of DURICEF* and CEFZIL*, oral
cephalosporin antibiotics, and ZERIT*, a new antiretroviral drug
approved by the FDA in June 1994, as well as strong sales of broad
spectrum penicillins.  In the Company's line of anti-cancer drugs,
sales increased 32% to $403.  TAXOL* (paclitaxel), which continues
to benefit from the April 1994 approval for use in the treatment of
breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for
metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant
chemotherapy, experienced very strong growth.  Sales of PLATINOL*
and PARAPLATIN* also increased in domestic and international
markets.  Sales of central nervous system drugs increased due to
introductory sales of SERZONE*, the Company's newly launched
antidepressant which offers a low incidence of side effects, and
increases in sales of STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal spray
analgesic, and BUSPAR*, the Company's novel anti-anxiety agent.
Dermatological drug sales increased primarily due to very strong
sales of DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3 analogue for the treatment of
moderate psoriasis.  In March 1995, the Company received FDA
approval to market Glucophage, a new oral anti-diabetes agent for
Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes.  For the first quarter of
1994, sales of the pharmaceutical products segment increased 6%
over the first quarter of 1993 primarily as a result of increases
in sales of cardiovascular, anti-cancer and central nervous system
drugs.

In the medical devices segment, sales increased 9% to $453.  In
January 1995, the Company acquired Calgon Vestal Laboratories, a
skin care and infection control products business.  Excluding the
effect of the acquisition and the divestiture of Xomed-Treace, Inc.
in April 1994, sales increased 5%, reflecting a 2% increase due to

volume, a 1% decrease due to selling prices, and a 4% increase due
to the favorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Sales of
ostomy care products increased due to the growth of the ACTIVE
LIFE/COLODRESS* and the SUR-FIT/ COMBIHESIVE* product lines.
Worldwide sales of prosthetic implants, which were adversely
affected by competitive pressures, increased 1% with growth of the
Insall/Burstein II Modular Total Knee System, the MGII* Total Knee
System, and the CENTRALIGN* Precoat Hip Prosthesis. During the
first quarter, the Company launched the NEXGEN* Complete Knee
Solution, its advanced knee replacement system. In the Company's
line of wound care products, sales increased reflecting volume
growth of DUODERM* products.  For the first quarter of 1994,
medical devices segment sales increased 2% (an increase of 5%
excluding the effect of businesses divested in the fourth quarter
of 1993) over the prior year due to increased sales of prosthetic
implants, ostomy and wound care products.

Sales of the nonprescription health products segment increased 26%
to $580.  In September 1994, the Company acquired the remaining
ownership interest of the UPSA Group, the leading maker and
marketer of analgesics in France and Belgium and a world leader in
effervescent technology.  Excluding the acquisition of UPSA, sales
increased 9%, reflecting a 6% increase due to volume, a 2% increase
due to selling prices, and a 1% increase due to the favorable
effect of foreign currency translation. ENFAMIL* and PROSOBEE*
infant formula sales increased with the addition of new sole-source
contracts in late 1994 and early 1995 under the federal
government's Women, Infants and Children program.  Sales of
LACTOFREE*, a milk-based, lactose-free infant formula, and
NUTRAMIGEN* infant formula also increased.  Sales of analgesics
also increased due to the sales of EXCEDRIN* in the U.S. and the
strong sales of BUFFERIN* in Japan.  With the addition of
EFFERALGAN*, ASPIRINE UPSA* and DAFALGAN* from UPSA, the Company's
participation in Europe's growing self-medication market place has
been enhanced.  For the first quarter of 1994, the nonprescription
health products segment sales were 3% below the first quarter of
the prior year primarily as a result of decreases in sales of
analgesics, cough/cold remedies and Gerber Baby Formula.

Sales of the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 32% over
the prior year to $373.  In August 1994, the Company acquired
Matrix Essentials, Inc., the leading manufacturer in North America
of professional hair care and beauty products sold exclusively in
beauty salons.  Excluding the acquisition of Matrix, sales
increased 11%, reflecting  a 10% increase due to volume, a 3%
increase due to selling prices, and a 2% decrease due to the
unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Strong market
growth led to increased sales of haircoloring products.
Introductory sales of NATURAL INSTINCTS*, launched in the U.S. in
the latter part of 1994, contributed to the sales growth in
haircoloring products.  Sales of hair care products increased,
benefiting from the addition of the SYSTEME BIOLAGE*, VAVOOM!* and
MATRIX ESSENTIALS* lines from Matrix, as well as the launch of the
HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos and conditioners.  For
the first quarter of 1994, sales of the toiletries and beauty aids
segment were 3% below the first quarter of the prior year (an

increase of 2% excluding the effect of businesses divested in the
fourth quarter of 1993) as increased sales of haircoloring and skin
care products were more than offset by decreased sales of anti-
perspirants and hair care products.

Cost of Products Sold and Operating Expenses
- --------------------------------------------

Total costs and expenses for the quarters ended March 31, 1995 and
1994 as a percentage of sales were 71.8% and 70.8%, respectively,
increasing primarily due to the acquired businesses.  Cost of
products sold increased to 26.6% of sales from 26.3% in 1994.
Marketing, selling, administrative and other expenses as a
percentage of sales were 25.1% in 1995 and 24.2% in 1994.
Expenditures for advertising and promotion in support of new and
existing products increased 19% to $375 from $315 in 1994.
Research and development expenses increased 11% to $290 from $261
in 1994, and as a percentage of sales were 8.8% compared to 9.2%.
Pharmaceutical research and development spending increased 10% over
the prior year and as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was
13.0% compared to 13.4% in 1994.

Earnings
- --------

Earnings before income taxes for the first quarter increased 13% to
$932 from $828 in 1994.  Net earnings increased 13% to $657 from
$581 and earnings per share increased 13% to $1.29 from $1.14 in
1994.

Financial Position
- ------------------

The balance sheet at March 31, 1995 and the statement of cash flows
for the three months then ended reflect the Company's strong
financial position.  The Company continues to maintain a high level
of working capital totaling $2,275 at March 31, 1995 compared to
$2,436 at December 31, 1994.

Internally generated funds continue to be the Company's primary
source for financing expenditures for new plant and equipment.
Additions to fixed assets for the three months ended March 31, 1995
were $90 compared to $107 during the same period of 1994.

During the three months ended March 31, 1995, the Company purchased
651,600 shares of its common stock.

                       ---------------------------


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered
normal to its business are pending against the Company and certain
of its subsidiaries.  The most significant of these are reported in
the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994
with material developments since that report described below.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

At the end of April, 1995, the federal judge overseeing the pending
settlement of the breast implant litigation concluded from a random
sampling of claims filed during the settlement process that the
total amount of the "current claims" portion of the settlement that
are likely to be approved for payment would substantially exceed
the amount allocated for that purpose.  Under the global settlement
agreement, approximately $1.2 billion of the $4.25 billion
settlement total for all defendants is presently allocated to this
"current claims" fund.  The settlement agreement provides that if
current claims do exceed the amount allocated, a reduction of the
amount to be paid to individual claimants would be required.  This
would afford class members a "second opt out" right permitting them
to pursue their claims individually.  If claimants opt out because
of such reduction, defendants may choose to withdraw from the
settlement.  The settlement agreement requires that before any such
reduction, the parties attempt to negotiate satisfactory
adjustments.  At the judge's request, the Company and the other
parties to the settlement agreement have commenced such
negotiations.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

The Company, one of its subsidiaries and others are defendants in
22 antitrust actions in 19 states filed on behalf of purported
statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products
and by the Attorneys General of Mississippi and Texas alleging a
price fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or
deceptive trade practices laws and seeking certification of
statewide classes, damages, statutory and civil penalties and other
relief.  In the Louisiana indirect purchaser case, the federal
district court's decision to remand the case has been reversed by
the appellate court with directions to the federal district court
to retain jurisdiction.  In Nevada, the state court dismissed the
complaint but plaintiffs are expected to appeal as has been done in
the already dismissed Colorado and Florida state actions.  The suit
filed by the State of Louisiana in federal court is still pending.
The investigations of domestic infant formula pricing and marketing
started by five state Attorneys General are still pending.  The
civil and criminal inquiries by the Canadian Bureau of Competition
Policy into alleged anticompetitive practices by the Company and
certain other members of the Canadian infant formula industry are
ongoing.  While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the
foregoing and of other pending matters, the Company believes that

the ultimate disposition of such matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's operating results, liquidity or
consolidated financial position.

Pharmaceutical Pricing Litigation
- ---------------------------------

The Company, along with more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers, is a
defendant in over 100 actions brought by over 3000 plaintiffs in
various federal courts seeking damages and injunctive relief under
the federal antitrust laws for alleged antitrust violations in the
pricing and marketing of brand-name prescription drugs.  The
federal court cases have been transferred for pre-trial purposes to
the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois.  These lawsuits are of three different varieties: (1)
individual actions by independent retail pharmacies; (2) class
actions by retail pharmacies seeking to represent a class comprised
of those alleged to be similarly situated; and (3) individual
actions by large retail pharmacy chains and supermarkets.
Discovery is ongoing in the cases.  The defendants have entered
into a Judgment Sharing Agreement; the Court has denied plaintiffs'
motion seeking to invalidate that arrangement.  The Court has set a
trial date of April 1, 1996.  A Case Management Order agreed to by
the defendants and counsel for the individual and chain store
plaintiffs stipulates that discovery of those plaintiffs' price
discrimination claims under the federal Robinson-Patman Act will go
forward now only as to a subset of 20 individual drug stores and
four chain stores as plaintiffs against a subset of five
pharmaceutical manufacturer defendants, not including the Company.
In addition, the Company, along with other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, wholesalers, certain pharmacy benefit managers and
others, has been named as a defendant in state court actions
commenced in California, Alabama, Wisconsin, Washington and
Minnesota.  These actions seek damages and injunctive relief under
antitrust and other laws of the states in question for alleged
violations in the pricing of prescription drugs, in some cases
including those not sold under brand names.  The actions in
Wisconsin and Minnesota and several of the California actions are
brought on behalf of purported classes of retail pharmacies.  The
Alabama case is brought on behalf of individual retail pharmacies
and also asserts a claim for fraud.  The Washington action and one
of the California actions are brought on behalf of purported
classes of consumers.  Discovery has commenced in some of these
actions.  Others are still at the pleading stage.  The Company
believes that these actions are without merit and that their
ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations, liquidity or consolidated
financial position.

Securities Litigation
- ---------------------

On April 5, 1995, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York entered a final judgment approving the
settlement of a class action which alleged violations of federal
securities laws and regulations in connection with, among other

material adverse effect on the Company's operating results,
liquidity or consolidated financial position.

          the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company of the holders of
          any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common
          Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, special meetings of

          and special meeting of the shareholders shall be in writing and
          shall be delivered personally or mailed in a postage prepaid

          person who appears on the books of the Company as a shareholder
          entitled to vote at such meeting, and to any shareholders who, by
          reason of any action proposed at such meeting, would be entitled
          to have their shares appraised if such action were taken.  The
          notice of every special meeting, besides stating the time and
          place of such meeting, shall state briefly the purpose or
          purposes thereof; and no business other than that specified in
          such notice or germane thereto shall be transacted at the
          meeting, except with the unanimous consent in writing of the
          holders of record of all of the shares of the Company entitled to
          vote at such meeting.  Notice of any meeting of shareholders
          shall not be required to be given to any shareholder entitled to
          participate in any action proposed to be taken at such meeting
          who shall attend such meeting in person or by proxy or who before
          or after any such meeting shall waive notice thereof in writing
          or by telegram, cable or wireless.  Notice of any adjourned
          meeting need not be given.

          the outstanding shares of the Company, present in person or by
          proxy and entitled to vote thereat, shall constitute a quorum for
          the transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum the
          holders of a majority in number of the shares of stock so present
          or represented and entitled to vote may adjourn the meeting from
          time to time until a quorum is present.  At any such adjourned
          meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be
          transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as

          meeting.  In the event the Chairman of the Board and the Board of
          Directors fail to so designate a chairman of the meeting the
          shareholders may designate an officer or shareholder as chairman.

          absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer shall appoint a
          secretary of the meeting.

          entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to one vote for each
          share of the Company standing in that shareholder's name on the
          books of the Company provided that no share of stock shall be
          voted at any election of directors which shall have been
          transferred on the books of the Company later than the record
          date announced by the Board of Directors or fixed by operation of
          these bylaws  The vote on shares may be given by the shareholder
          entitled thereto in person or by proxy duly appointed by an
          instrument in writing subscribed by such shareholder or that
          shareholder's duly authorized attorney, and delivered to the
          secretary of the meeting; provided, however, that no proxy shall

          be valid after the expiration of three years from the date of its
          execution unless the shareholder executing it shall have
          specified therein the length of time it is to continue in force,
          which shall be for some limited period.  At all meetings of
          shareholders, a quorum being present, all matters, except as
          otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation
          of the Company or these bylaws, shall be decided by the holders
          of a majority in number of the shares of stock of the Company
          present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote.  A share vote
          may be by ballot and each ballot shall state the name of the
          shareholder voting and the number of shares owned by that
          shareholder and shall be signed by such shareholder or by that
          shareholder's proxy.  Except as otherwise required by law or by
          these bylaws all voting may be viva voce.

11.       The Secretary or other officer in charge of the stock ledger of
          the Company shall prepare and make at least ten days before every
          meeting of shareholders a complete list of the shareholders
          entitled to vote at the meeting arranged in alphabetical order
          and showing the address of each shareholder and the number of
          shares registered in the name of each shareholder.  Such list
          shall be open to the examination of any shareholder for any
          purpose germane to the meeting during ordinary business hours for
          a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting either at a
          place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which
          place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not
          so specified at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The
          list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the
          meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any
          shareholder who is present.  The stock ledger shall be the only
          evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine the
          stock ledger, the list required by this bylaw, or the books of
          the Company or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of
          shareholders.

12.       The Board of Directors shall present at each annual meeting, and
          when called for by vote of the shareholders at any special
          meeting of the shareholders, a full and clear statement of the
          business and condition of the Company.

13.       At all elections of directors and when otherwise required by law,
          the chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of
          election.  The inspectors shall be responsible for receiving,
          tabulating and reporting the result of the votes taken.  No
          director or candidate for the office of director shall be
          appointed such inspector.  The chairman of the meeting shall open
          and close the polls.

          DIRECTORS.

14.       The property, business and affairs of the Company shall be
          managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors,
          which may exercise all such powers of the Company and do all such
          lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the
          Certificate of Incorporation or by these bylaws directed or
          required to be exercised or done by the shareholders.

15.(a)    The Board of Directors shall consist of ten directors.  Directors
          need not be shareholders.  The number of directors may be
          determined by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors.


                                     E-1-7

<PAGE>

   (b)    Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation,
          by these bylaws or by law, at each meeting of the shareholders
          for the election of directors at which a quorum shall be present,
          the persons receiving a plurality of the votes cast shall be
          directors.  Such election shall be by ballot.

   (c)    The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders
          of any class or series of stock having a preference over the
          Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be
          classified, with respect to the time for which they severally
          hold office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as
          possible, as determined by the Board of Directors, one class to
          be originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting
          of stockholders to be held in 1985, another class to be
          originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of
          stockholders to be held in 1986, and another class to be
          originally elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of
          stockholders to be held in 1987, with the directors of each class
          to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified.
          At each annual meeting of the stockholders, the successors of the
          class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be
          elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting
          of stockholders held in the third year following the year of
          their election.  No decrease in the number of directors
          constituting the Board of Directors or change in the restrictions
          and qualifications for directors shall shorten the term of any
          incumbent director.

   (d)    Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
          or in these bylaws, each director shall continue in office until
          the expiration of his term of office and until a successor shall
          have been elected and shall have qualified, or until the director
          shall have resigned, or, in the case of a director who is an
          employee of the Company, until the director shall have resigned
          from employment with the Company or the director's employment
          shall have been terminated by the Company.  In addition, a
          director who is not an employee of the Company or who is the
          Chief Executive Officer of the Company or a retired Chief
          Executive Officer of the Company shall retire from the position
          of director at the Annual Meeting following attainment of age 70;
          an employee who is a director of the Company (other than the
          Chief Executive Officer or a retired Chief Executive Officer)
          shall retire from the position of director on the effective date
          of the director's retirement as an employee of the Company.  Any
          director of the Company may resign at any time by giving written
          notice to the Chairman of the Board or to the Secretary of the
          Company.  Such resignation shall take effect at the time
          specified therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein, the
          acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
          effective.  Exceptions to the requirements for the retirement of
          a director may be made by the Board of Directors.

   (e)    Subject to the rights under Article FOURTH of the Certificate of
          Incorporation of any class or series of stock having a preference
          over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to
          elect directors under specified circumstances, any director or
          entire class of directors or the entire Board of Directors may be
          removed from office, with or without cause, only by the
          affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the
          outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote
          generally in the election of directors, voting together as a
          single class.

<PAGE>

   (f)    Subject to the rights under Article FOURTH of the Certificate of
          Incorporation of the Company of the holders of any class or
          series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to
          dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified
          circumstances, newly created directorships resulting from any
          increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the
          Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement,
          disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled only by
          the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors
          then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board of
          Directors.  Any director elected in accordance with the preceding

          shall have no power as such.

21.       At each meeting of the Board of Directors the Chairman of the
          Board shall preside.  The Chairman of the Board may designate

          the Board attended and/or such annual fee as shall be determined
          from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors,
          provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to

          capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

24.(a)    The Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions, passed
          by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate an
          Executive Committee (and may discontinue the same at any time) to
          consist of three or more of the Directors of the Company.  The
          members shall be appointed by the Board of Directors and shall
          hold office during the pleasure of the Board of Directors;
          provided, however, that in the absence or disqualification of any
          member of the Executive Committee, the member or members thereof
          present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether
          or not the member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
          appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the
          meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
          The Executive Committee shall have and may exercise, during the
          intervals between the meetings of the Board of Directors, all of
          the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the

          Audit Committee to consist of three or more non-employee
          directors of the Company free from any relationship that, in the
          opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the
          exercise of independent judgment as a Committee member.   Any
          director who is a former employee of the Company may not serve on
          the Audit Committee.  The members of the Audit Committee shall be
          appointed by and hold office during the pleasure of the Board of
          Directors.  A majority of the members of the Audit Committee will
          constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  It shall be

          read, understand and are not aware of any violation of the
          Statement of Business Conduct; (v) to review with the Controller

          duties usually incident to the office of Secretary.  The
          Secretary shall also have such powers and perform such duties as
          are assigned by these bylaws, and shall have such other powers
          and perform such other duties, not inconsistent with these
          bylaws, as from time to time may be assigned by the Board of
          Directors.

39.       The Controller shall perform the usual duties pertaining to the
          office of the Controller.  The Controller shall have charge of
          the supervision of the accounting system of the Company,
          including the preparation and filing of all reports required by
          law to be made to any public authorities and officials, and shall
          also have such powers and perform such duties, not inconsistent
          with these bylaws, as from time to time may be assigned by the
          Board of Directors.

          such powers and perform such duties as are assigned to them by
          these bylaws and shall have such other powers and perform such
          other duties, not inconsistent with these bylaws, as from time to
          time may be assigned to them by the Treasurer or the Secretary,
          respectively, or by the Board of Directors.

41.       The compensation of the Chairman of the Board, Vice Chairman of
          the Board, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary and
          Controller shall be fixed by the Board of Directors.  The
          compensation of such other officers as may be appointed in
          accordance with the provisions of these bylaws may be fixed by
          the Chairman of the Board.  No officer shall be prevented from
          receiving such compensation by reason of also being a director of
          the Company.

          CONTRACTS, CHECKS, DRAFTS, BANK ACCOUNTS, ETC.

42.       The Board of Directors except as in these bylaws otherwise
          provided, may authorize any officer or officers, agent or agents,
          in the name of and on behalf of the Company, to enter into any
          contract or execute and deliver any instrument, and such

                                      E-1-15

<PAGE>

          authority may be general or confined to specific instances; and,
          unless so authorized by the Board of Directors or expressly
          authorized by these bylaws, no officer or agent or employee shall
          have any power or authority to bind the Company by any contract
          or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it pecuniarily
          liable for any purpose or to any amount.

43.       No loans shall be contracted on behalf of the Company and no
          negotiable paper shall be issued in its name unless authorized by
          resolution of the Board of Directors.  When authorized by the
          Board of Directors, any officer or agent of the Company thereunto
          authorized may effect loans and advances at any time for the
          Company from any bank, trust company, or other institution, or
          from any firm, corporation or individual, and for such loans and
          advances may make, execute and deliver promissory notes, bonds,
          or other certificates or evidences of indebtedness of the Company
          and, when authorized so to do, may pledge, hypothecate or
          transfer any securities or other property of the Company as
          security for any such loans or advances.  Such authority may be
          general or confined to specified instances.

44.       All checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of moneys out
          of the funds of the Company and all notes or other evidences of
          indebtedness of the Company shall be signed on behalf of the
          Company in such manner as shall from time to time be determined
          by resolution of the Board of Directors.

45.       All funds of the Company not otherwise employed shall be
          deposited from time to time to the credit of the Company in such
          banks, trust companies or other depositories as the Board of
          Directors may select or as may be selected by any officer or
          officers, agent or agents of the Company to whom such power may
          from time to time be delegated by the Board of Directors; and for
          the purpose of such deposit, the Chairman of the Board, the Vice
          Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice President, the
          Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any other officer or
          agent or employee of the Company to whom such power may be
          delegated by the Board of Directors, may endorse, assign and
          deliver checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of moneys
          which are payable to the order of the Company.

          CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFERS OF SHARES.

46.       Certificates for shares of the Company shall be in such form as
          shall be approved by the Board of Directors. Such certificates
          shall be numbered and registered in the order in which they are
          issued and shall be signed by the  Chairman of the Board, the
          Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or a Vice President and
          the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an
          Assistant Treasurer.  Where any such certificate is countersigned
          by a transfer agent, other than the Company or its employee, or
          by a registrar, other than the Company or its employee, any other
          signature on such certificate may be a facsimile, engraved,
          stamped or printed.  In the event that an officer whose facsimile
          signature appears on such certificate ceases for any reason to
          hold the office indicated and the Company or its transfer agent
          has on hand a supply of share certificates bearing such officer's
          facsimile signature, such certificates may continue to be issued
          and registered until such supply is exhausted.

47.       Transfers of shares of the Company shall be made only on the

                                      E-1-16

<PAGE>

          books of the Company by the holder thereof, or by the holder's
          attorney thereunto duly authorized and on surrender of the
          certificate or certificates for such shares properly endorsed.
          Every certificate surrendered to the Company shall be marked
          "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, and no new
          certificate shall be issued in exchange therefor until the old
          certificate has been surrendered and cancelled, except as
          hereinafter provided.

48.       The holder of any shares of the Company shall immediately notify
          the Company of any loss, destruction or mutilation of the
          certificate therefor and the Company may issue a new certificate
          in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it alleged
          to have been lost, destroyed or mutilated.  The Board of
          Directors may, in its discretion, as conditions to the issue of
          any such new certificate, require the owner of the lost or
          destroyed certificate or the owner's legal representatives to
          make proof satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the loss or
          destruction thereof and to give the Company a bond in such form,
          in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of
          Directors may direct, to indemnify the Company against any claim
          that may be made against it on account of any such certificate so
          alleged to have been lost or destroyed.

          DETERMINATION OF RECORD DATE.

49.       In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled
          to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any
          adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any
          dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or
          entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
          conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
          lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record
          date which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before
          the date of such meeting nor more than 60 days prior to any other
          action.

          If no record date is fixed:

          (i)  The record date for determining shareholders entitled to
               notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be
               at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
               on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the
               close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
               the meeting is held.

          (ii) The record date for determining shareholders for any other
               purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on
               which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating
               thereto. A determination of shareholders of record entitled
               to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall
               apply to any adjournment of the meeting provided, however,
               that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
               the adjourned meeting.

          REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS.

50.       The Company shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of
          any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and,
          accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
          other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other

                                      E-1-17

<PAGE>

          person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice
          thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of Delaware.

          FISCAL YEAR.

51.       The fiscal year shall begin on the first day of January and end
          on the thirty-first day of December in each year.

          NOTICES.

52.       Whenever under the provision of these bylaws notice is required
          to be given to any director or shareholder, it shall be construed
          to mean personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing,
          by mail, by depositing the same in a post office or letter box,
          in a postpaid sealed wrapper, addressed to such director or
          shareholder at such address as appears on the books of the
          Company, or, in default of other address, to such director or
          shareholder, at the General Post Office in the City of
          Wilmington, Delaware, and such notice shall be deemed to be given
          at the time when the same shall be thus mailed.

53.       Any notice required to be given under these bylaws may be waived
          in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said
          notice, whether before or after the time stated therein.

          AMENDMENTS.

54.       Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
          of the Company and consistent therewith, these bylaws may be
          altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be made by the
          affirmative vote of the holders of record of a majority of the
          shares of the Company entitled to vote, at any annual or special
          meeting, provided that such proposed action shall be stated in
          the notice of such meeting, or, by a vote of the majority of the
          whole Board of Directors, at any regular meeting without notice,
          or at any special meeting provided that notice of such proposed
          action shall be stated in the notice of such special meeting.
