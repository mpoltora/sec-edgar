           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    (Unaudited, dollars in millions except per share amounts)

Note 1:   Basis of Presentation
- -------------------------------

In   the   opinion  of  management,  the  accompanying  unaudited
consolidated   financial  statements  include   all   adjustments
(consisting  only  of normal adjustments) necessary  for  a  fair
presentation  of  the financial position of Bristol-Myers  Squibb
Company (the "Company") at March 31, 2000 and December 31,  1999,
the  results of operations for the three months ended  March  31,
2000  and  1999, and cash flows for the three months ended  March
31,  2000  and  1999.   These consolidated  financial  statements
should  be  read  in conjunction with the consolidated  financial
statements  and the related notes included in the Company's  1999
Annual  Report  on  Form 10-K.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  the
Company's independent accountants, have performed a review of the
unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein,  and
their review report thereon accompanies this filing.


Note 2: Earnings Per Share
- --------------------------
Basic  earnings per common share are computed using the  weighted
average  number of shares outstanding during the  year.   Diluted
earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average
number   of  shares  outstanding  during  the  year,   plus   the
incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of  dilutive
stock options.

The  computations for basic earnings per common share and diluted
earnings per common share are as follows:

Note 3: Restructuring
- ---------------------

During  the first quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a  pretax
charge of $120 million in marketing, selling, administrative  and
other  expenses for restructuring activities. The charge  related
to   work-force   reductions,  downsizing  and  streamlining   of
operations  in  certain international markets  and  the  ConvaTec
business, and the reorganization of the Company's Global Business
Services.

Of  the  total  restructuring  charge,  $77  million  relates  to
employee  termination benefits for approximately 1,400 employees.
The  remaining $43 million represents the closure of  facilities,
primarily  in  the  ConvaTec business and  certain  international
markets.  At March 31, 2000, $77 million was included in  accrued
expenses  related  to these activities.  The Company  expects  to
substantially complete these restructuring activities by the  end
of 2000.


Note 4: Divestitures
- --------------------

In  February  2000,  the  Company completed  the  sale  of  three
pharmaceutical products - Estrace Cream, Ovcon 35 and  Ovcon  50,
resulting in a pre-tax gain of $120 million.


Note 5: Pension Contribution
- ----------------------------

In  January 2000, the Company made a contribution of $230 million
to fund its U.S. Retirement Income Plan.

                Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
of  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its subsidiaries as  of
March  31,  2000, and the related consolidated statement  of
earnings and comprehensive income and of cash flows for  the
three-month  periods ended March 31, 2000  and  1999.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.

We   conducted  our  review  in  accordance  with  standards
established  by  the American Institute of Certified  Public
Accountants.   A  review  of interim  financial  information
consists  principally of applying analytical  procedures  to
financial  data and making inquiries of persons  responsible
for  financial  and accounting matters.  It is substantially
less  in  scope  than an audit conducted in accordance  with
generally  accepted  auditing standards,  the  objective  of
which  is  the  expression  of  an  opinion  regarding   the
financial statements taken as a whole.  Accordingly,  we  do
not express such an opinion.

Based  on  our  review,  we are not aware  of  any  material
modifications  that  should  be  made  to  the  accompanying
consolidated interim financial statements for them to be  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted  in
the United States.

We  previously audited in accordance with auditing standards
generally  accepted in the United States,  the  consolidated
balance  sheet  as  of December 31, 1999,  and  the  related
consolidated  statements of earnings,  comprehensive  income
and  retained earnings and of cash flows for the  year  then
ended  (not  presented  herein), and  in  our  report  dated
January  24,  2000  we expressed an unqualified  opinion  on
those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the
information  set  forth  in  the  accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheet as of December 31, 1999, is fairly stated  in
all  material  respects  in  relation  to  the  consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Condition and Results of Operations

First Quarter Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------

Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 2000 increased  8%  over
the  prior year to $5,260 million. The consolidated sales  growth
resulted from a 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase  due  to
changes  in  selling  prices and a 3%  decrease  due  to  foreign
exchange  rate  fluctuations.   U.S.  sales  increased  14%   and
international  sales  decreased 2% (a 4% increase  excluding  the
effect of foreign exchange).

Sales  in  the  medicines products segment  (pharmaceuticals  and
consumer  medicines),  which is the largest  segment  at  72%  of
total  Company  sales, increased 10% over the  first  quarter  of
1999  to  $3,783  million.   Sales growth  resulted  from  a  10%
increase  in  volume, a 3% increase in selling prices  and  a  3%
decrease  due  to  foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Worldwide
pharmaceutical  sales  increased  12%  with  U.S.  pharmaceutical
sales  up  20%  over  the  prior year. Consumer  medicines  sales
increased 2% (9% excluding foreign exchange).

GLUCOPHAGE  (metformin), the leading branded oral medication  for
treatment  of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes,  continued
its  strong  growth  rate  with  sales  increasing  51%  to  $426
million.  In  March  2000,  the  U.S.  marketing  exclusivity  of
GLUCOPHAGE  was extended through September 3, 2000 based  on  the
Company's  completion  of  pediatric studies  which  qualify  for
benefits under U.S. research incentive legislation.

Sales of TAXOL* (paclitaxel), the Company's leading anti-cancer
agent, increased 17% to $385 million.
PLAVIX,  a  platelet aggregation inhibitor for the reduction  of
stroke,  heart  attack  and  vascular death  in  atherosclerotic
patients  with recent stroke, recent heart attack or  peripheral
arterial  disease,  increased  128%  to  $201  million  for  the
quarter.   AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor  blocker  for  the
treatment of hypertension, increased 74% to  $87 million. AVAPRO
and  PLAVIX are cardiovascular products that were launched  from
the Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi S.A. joint venture.

Sales  of BUSPAR*, an anti-anxiety agent, increased 24% to  $163
million  following  a  direct-to-consumer campaign  launched  in
December 1999. The exclusivity period  for BUSPAR expires in May
2000. Sales of SERZONE*, a novel anti-depressant, increased  38%
to $87 million.

Sales of the anti-cancer agent PARAPLATIN* increased 7% to  $160
million  as  the product continues to benefit from  its  use  in
combination with other chemotherapy agents.

Sales  of  ZERIT*  and VIDEX*, the Company's two  antiretroviral
agents,  remained at prior year levels of $151 million  and  $45
million, respectively.

*      Indicates  brand  names  of  products  which  are  registered
trademarks owned by the Company.

Sales  of  TEQUIN*, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic,
launched  in  December  1999, were $15 million.  In  just  three
months on the market, TEQUIN has been prescribed to more than
200,000  people.  In  March 2000, the Company  entered  into  an
agreement  to  have  Schering-Plough co-promote  TEQUIN  in  the
United States.

Sales  of Oncology Therapeutics Network, a specialty distributor
of  anti-cancer  medicines and related  products,  reached  $244
million, an increase of 21% over the prior year.

Worldwide  sales  of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's  largest  selling
product, decreased 5% to $461 million for the quarter.

Sales  of  EXCEDRIN* increased 5% to $62 million  and  sales  of
BUFFERIN* increased 14% (7% excluding foreign exchange)  to  $33
million.

Earnings  before  taxes  for  the  medicines  products   segment
increased  17%  to $1,169 million in 2000. As  a  percentage  of
sales, earnings before taxes for this segment improved to  30.9%
in  2000 from 29.2% in 1999 primarily due to improvements, as  a
percentage of sales, in cost of products sold.

Sales  in the beauty care products segment decreased 4% to  $549
million.  The  decline in sales resulted from a 5%  decrease  in
volume,  a  1% increase in selling prices and no effect  due  to
foreign exchange. Haircolor sales increased 3% with increases in
NICE  'N EASY* of 4% to $48 million and HYDRIENCE* of 9% to  $24
million.  AUSSIE*  products added $32  million  to  Beauty  Care
sales, an increase of 10% over the prior year. HERBAL ESSENCES*,
a  complete  line of shampoos, conditioners, styling aids,  body
wash  and  facial  care, decreased 5% to $151  million.  Clairol
continues to be the number one hair products company in the U.S.
Earnings before taxes for the beauty care segment increased  17%
to $76 million in 2000 from $65 million in 1999 primarily due to
a  decrease, as a percentage of sales, in advertising  expenses.
In  April,  the  Company  reached an agreement  to  sell  Matrix
Essentials  to Cosmair, Inc., a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary  of
L'Oreal  S.A.   The  transaction is expected to  close  sometime
during the second quarter.

Sales in the nutritional products segment increased 13% to  $506
million.  Sales growth resulted from a 12% increase in volume, a
1%  increase  in  selling prices and no effect  due  to  foreign
exchange   rate   fluctuations.  The  Company's   Mead   Johnson
subsidiary  continues  to  build  on  its  U.S.  and   worldwide
leadership position in the infant formula market. ENFAMIL*,  the
Company's largest-selling infant formula, recorded sales of $204
million,  an increase of 9% from the prior year.  Adult consumer
nutritional sales increased 41% as a result of a 39% increase in
sales  of  BOOST*  to $32 million and $15 million  in  sales  of
VIACTIV*  Soft  Calcium Chews.  Earnings before  taxes  for  the
nutritional segment increased to $120 million in 2000 from  $101
million  in  1999,  and as a percentage of sales,  increased  to
23.7%  from  22.5%  in 1999 primarily due to a  decrease,  as  a
percentage  of sales, in cost of products sold and  sales  force
expenses.

Medical  device segment sales increased 5% to $422 million,  due
to  volume  increases  of 7% and a 2% decrease  due  to  foreign
exchange.   Zimmer  sales  increased  9%  to  $260  million  (8%
excluding  foreign  exchange).   Knee  joint  replacement  sales
increased  9%  to $102 million, hip replacement sales  increased
13%  to $80 million and fracture management sales increased  23%
to  $37 million.  ConvaTec sales decreased 1% to $162 million (a
4%  increase excluding foreign exchange).  Sales of modern wound
care  products increased 2% to $57 million (7% excluding foreign

                                        10
<PAGE>

exchange)  while sales of ostomy products decreased  4%  to  $98
million.   Earnings before taxes for the medical device  segment
increased 11% to $80 million in 2000 from $72 million in 1999
and, as a percentage of sales, increased to 19.0% in  2000 from
17.9% in 1999, resulting from decreases, as a percentage of
sales, in research and development expenses.

Operating Expenses
- ------------------

Total  expenses,  as a percentage of sales, decreased  to  68.1%
from  69.6% in 1999.  Cost of products sold, as a percentage  of
sales,  decreased to 26.2% from 26.9% in 1999 primarily  due  to
product mix.

Marketing,  selling,  administrative and other  expenses,  as  a
percentage of sales, decreased to 22.1% in the first quarter  of
2000  from  23.1% in 1999. Also included in marketing,  selling,
administrative and other expenses were a pre-tax  gain  of  $120
million from the divestiture of three pharmaceutical products  -
Estrace  Cream,  Ovcon  35 and Ovcon  50,  and  a  $120  million
provision for restructuring. The restructuring charge related to
work-force reductions in certain of the international  medicines
markets, ConvaTec and the reorganization of the Company's Global
Business Services. (See also Note 3 to the financial statements)

Expenditures for advertising and promotion in support of new and
existing products increased 8% to $570 million from $529 million
in  1999. Research and development expenditures increased 11% to
$468  million from $423 million in 1999. Pharmaceutical research
and  development spending increased 13% over the prior year, and
as  a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.3% in the first
quarter  of  2000  and 12.2% in the first quarter  of  1999.  In
April,  the  Company voluntarily withdrew its current  New  Drug
Application (NDA) for VANLEV* (omapatrilat) from the  U.S.  Food
and  Drug  Administration  (FDA). The  Company  now  expects  to
resubmit  its application early next year. Also, in April  2000,
the Company resubmitted its NDA to the FDA for UFT(R) capsules for
use  with leucovorin calcium tablets in the first-line treatment
of advanced colorectal cancer.

Earnings
- --------

Earnings  before  income taxes increased 14% to  $1,678  million
from  $1,476 million in 1999. The effective tax rate on earnings
before  income  taxes decreased to 27.2% in 2000 from  27.8%  in
1999. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable  to
higher  operating  earnings from lower  tax  jurisdictions.  Net
earnings increased 15% to $1,221 million from $1,066 million  in
1999.  Basic earnings per share increased 15% to $.62 from  $.54
in  1999  and diluted earnings per share increased 15%  to  $.61
from $.53 in 1999.

Financial Position
- ------------------

The  balance sheet at March 31, 2000 and the statement  of  cash
flows  for  the  three months then ended reflect  the  Company's
strong financial position.  The Company continues to maintain  a
high  level of working capital, $3.7 billion at March 31,  2000,
at approximately the same level as December 31, 1999.

                                        11

Long-Term Debt decreased slightly to $1,333 million from  $1,342
million at December 1999.

Internally generated funds continue to be the Company's  primary

Net  Cash  Provided  by Operating Activities increased  to  $738
million in 2000.  Additions to fixed assets for the three months
ended  March 31, 2000 were $91 million compared to $122  million
during the same period of 1999.

In  January  2000, the Company made a contribution  of  $230
million to fund its U.S. Retirement Income Plan.

During  the  three months ended March 31, 2000, the  Company
purchased 9.9 million shares of its common stock at  a  cost
of $563 million.

Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.  These  statements
involve  a  number of risks, uncertainties and  other  factors
that  could  cause  actual results to differ  materially  from

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
- ---------------------------

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Various  lawsuits,  claims and proceedings of a  nature  considered
normal  to its business are pending against the Company and certain
of its subsidiaries.  The most significant of these are reported in
the  Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1999 and any subsequent material developments in  such
matters are described below.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

As  previously reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for  the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, the Company, together
with  its  subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation  (MEC),  and
certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in a  number
of  claims  and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries  of
various  types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured
by MEC or a related company.

Of  the  more  than 90,000 claims or potential claims  against  the
Company  in direct lawsuits or through registration in the national
class action Revised Settlement Program, most have been dealt  with
through the Revised Settlement, other settlements, or trial.  As of
May  1,  2000,  the Company's contingent liability  in  respect  of
breast  implant  claims  was  limited to  residual  unpaid  Revised
Settlement Program obligations and to roughly 1,550  remaining opt-
outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court.

As  of  May  1,  2000, approximately 5,800 United States  and  200
foreign  breast  implant  recipients were plaintiffs  in  lawsuits
pending  in federal and state courts in the United States  and  in
certain courts in Canada and Australia.  These figures include the
claims  of  plaintiffs that are in the process  of  being  settled
and/or  dismissed.  In these lawsuits, about 3,000 U.S. plaintiffs
and  46  foreign  plaintiffs opted out of the Revised  Settlement.
The  lawsuits of approximately 2,800 U.S. plaintiffs who  did  not
opt out are expected to be dismissed as these plaintiffs are among
the  estimated  74,000  women  with  MEC  implants  who  chose  to
participate  in the nationwide settlement.  Of the  3,000  opt-out
plaintiffs, an estimated 1,450 plaintiffs have claims  based  upon
products  that were not manufactured and sold by MEC or that  have
been  or  are  in  the process of being settled and/or  dismissed.
Accordingly,  the number of remaining plaintiffs who have  pursued
or may pursue their claims in court against the Company is roughly
1,550 as stated in the preceding paragraph.

Under the terms of the Revised Settlement Program, additional opt-
outs  are expected to be minimal since the deadline for U.S. claim
members  to  opt  out  has  passed.  In  addition,  the  Company's
remaining  obligations  under the Revised Settlement  Program  are
limited  because most payments to "Current Claimants" have already
been  made,  no  additional "Current Claims" may be filed  without
court approval, and because payments of claims to so-called "Other
Registrants"  and "Late Registrants" are limited by the  terms  of
the  Revised Settlement Program.  The Company believes it will  be
able  to  address  remaining opt-out claims as well  as  remaining
obligations  under  the  Revised  Settlement  Program  within  its
reserves as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form  10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.

                                        13
<PAGE>

On  March  31, 2000, the federal government filed a civil  suit  in
federal  district  court  in Birmingham, Alabama,  against  several
parties  in  the breast implant litigation, including the  Company.
The  government claims it is entitled to reimbursement for  certain
costs  incurred  in connection with medical treatment  provided  to
women  with breast implants.  The Company believes it will be  able
to  address the government lawsuit within its reserves as described
in  the  Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the  fiscal  year
ended December 31, 1999.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

The  Company  remains  a defendant in several  actions  challenging
pricing  on brand name prescription drugs.  These actions  include:
several  currently consolidated antitrust actions  brought  against
the   Company   and   more   than   thirty   other   pharmaceutical
manufacturers,  drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit  managers  by
certain   chain  drugstores,  supermarket  chains  and  independent
drugstores;  state  pharmaceutical  actions;  and  purported  class
actions  on  behalf  of consumers.  The Company  will  continue  to
defend  vigorously  its  position in this  ongoing  litigation  and
believes it will be able to address all remaining claims within its
reserves  as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form  10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

As  previously reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for  the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, the Company,  one  of
its  subsidiaries, and others have been defendants in a  number  of
antitrust  actions in various states filed on behalf  of  purported
statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products
and   by   the  Attorneys  General  of  Louisiana,  Minnesota   and
Mississippi,   alleging  a  price  fixing  conspiracy   and   other
violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws  and
seeking  penalties and other relief.  The Company has resolved  all
of  these actions. On April 3, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court decided
to  let  stand the lower court's decision dismissing a case pending
in Louisiana, which had been the only open case remaining.

TAXOL* Litigation
- -----------------

As  previously reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for  the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999, in 1997 and 1998, the
Company  filed several lawsuits alleging that a number  of  generic
drug  companies infringed its patents covering certain  methods  of
administering  paclitaxel  when they  filed  abbreviated  new  drug
applications  seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel.   The
generic drug company defendants are Boehringer Ingelheim Corp.; Ben
Venue    Laboratories,   Inc.;   Bedford   Laboratories;    Immunex
Corporation;   Zenith   Goldline   Pharmaceuticals,   Inc.;    Ivax
Corporation;  Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Marsam  Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.;   and   Schein  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  These  actions   were
consolidated for discovery in the United States District Court  for
the District of New Jersey.  The Company does not assert a monetary
claim  against  any  of the defendants, but seeks  to  prevent  the
defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates  the
Company's patents.  The defendants have asserted that they  do  not
infringe  the Company's patents and that these patents are  invalid
and  unenforceable.   Some defendants also  asserted  counterclaims
seeking  damages  for  alleged  antitrust  and  unfair  competition
violations.

On January 4, 2000, the District Court granted the Company's motion
to   dismiss  certain  of  the  antitrust  and  unfair  competition
counterclaims.   The Company's motion for summary judgment  on  the

                                        14
<PAGE>

remaining antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims was denied
on March 17, 2000.

On  February  29,  2000, the District Court  granted  in  part  the
generic  companies'  summary judgment  motions  for  invalidity  by
finding  all  claims of the Company's patents invalid,  except  for
claims  limited to the treatment of ovarian cancer. As a result  of
this  ruling, the generic companies may obtain U.S. Food  and  Drug
Administration  approval  to  market paclitaxel  for  treatment  of
metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy.
The  District Court's opinion left for determination at  trial  the
validity of the claims of the Company's patents directed to the low
dose,  three-hour administration of paclitaxel for  ovarian  cancer
and  denied the generic companies' summary judgment motion  arguing
non-infringement of the Company's patents.

In  order  to pursue an immediate appellate review of the  District
Court's  invalidity findings, the Company voluntarily  relinquished
all  rights in the remaining ovarian tumor specific claims  of  its
patents.   On  April  7,  2000,  the  District  Court  granted  the
Company's   request  for  an  entry  of  judgment.    The   Company
subsequently  filed  a notice of appeal with  the  Federal  Circuit
Court  of Appeals.  If the Company is successful on appeal and  the
trial  that would follow a successful appeal, the Company  believes
its remaining patent rights would apply to all tumor types.

It  is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of
the outcome of the appeal and the remaining claims in these actions
nor to reasonably estimate the impact on TAXOL* sales or the amount
of damages were the Company not to prevail.

VANLEV* Litigation
- ------------------

The Company, its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer,
Charles  A.  Heimbold,  Jr. and its Chief  Scientific  Officer  and
President  - Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Peter S.  Ringrose,
Ph.D., are defendants in a number of purported class actions  filed
in April and May in the U.S. District Court for the District of New
Jersey   alleging  violations  of  federal  securities   laws   and
regulations.    Plaintiffs  claim that the defendants  disseminated
materially  false and misleading statements and failed to  disclose
information concerning the safety and expected availability of  its
product  VANLEV* during the period November 8, 1999  through  April
19,  2000.   Plaintiffs  seek compensatory damages  and  costs  and
expenses.

                       BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
              2000 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN

     1.Purpose:

     The  purpose  of  the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company  2000  Non-Employee
Directors'  Stock  Option Plan ("the Plan") is to secure for  Bristol-Myers
Squibb  Company  ("the Company") and its stockholders the benefits  of  the
incentive  inherent in increased common stock ownership by the  members  of
the  Board  of  Directors  ("the Board") of the Company  who  are  Eligible
Directors as defined in the Plan.

     2.Administration:

     The Plan shall be administered by the Board.  The Board shall have all
the  powers  vested in it by the terms of the Plan, such powers to  include
authority (within the limitations described herein) to prescribe  the  form
of  the  agreement embodying awards of stock options made  under  the  Plan
("Options").  The Board shall, subject to the provisions of the Plan, grant
Options  under the Plan and shall have the power to construe the  Plan,  to
determine  all  questions arising thereunder and to adopt  and  amend  such
rules  and  regulations for the administration of the Plan as it  may  deem
desirable.  Any decision of the Board in the administration of the Plan, as
described herein, shall be final and conclusive.  The Board may act only by
a  majority  of its members in office, except that the members thereof  may
authorize  any one or more of their number or the Secretary  or  any  other
officer  of the Company to execute and deliver documents on behalf  of  the
Board.  No member of the Board shall be liable for anything done or omitted
to be done by such member or by any other member of the Board in connection
with  the  Plan,  except  for such member's own willful  misconduct  or  as
expressly provided by statute.

     3.Amount of Stock:

     The  stock  which may be issued and sold under the Plan  will  be  the
Common  Stock (par value $.10 per share) of the Company, of a total  number
not  exceeding  750,000  shares,  subject  to  adjustment  as  provided  in
Paragraph  6  below.  The stock to be issued may be either  authorized  and
unissued  shares  or  issued  shares  acquired  by  the  Company   or   its
subsidiaries.  In  the  event that Options granted  under  the  Plan  shall
terminate  or  expire  without being exercised in whole  or  in  part,  new
Options may be granted covering the shares not purchased under such  lapsed
Options.

     4.Eligible Directors:

     The  members of the Board who are eligible to participate in the  Plan
are  persons who serve as directors of the Company after the effective date
of the Plan and:

     (a)    who are not current or former employees of the Company and

     (b)     who  are  not  and,  in the past, have not  been  eligible  to
       receive Options on Company stock by participation as an employee  in
       another  plan  sponsored  by  the Company  or  under  a  contractual
       arrangement with the Company.

     5.  Terms and Conditions of Options:

     Each  Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an agreement
in  such  form as the Board shall prescribe from time to time in accordance
with the Plan and shall comply with the following terms and conditions:

     (a)     The  Option exercise price shall be the fair market  value  of
       the  Common  Stock shares subject to such Option  on  the  date  the
       Option  is granted, which shall be the average of the high  and  the
       low  sales  prices of a Common Stock share on the date of  grant  as
       reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions  Tape
       or,  if  the New York Stock Exchange is closed on that date, on  the
       last  preceding date on which the New York Stock Exchange  was  open
       for trading.


                                        E-10-1

<PAGE>

     (b)      Each  year,  as  of  the  date  of  the  Annual  Meeting   of
       Stockholders  of the Company, each Eligible Director  who  has  been
       elected  or reelected or who is continuing as a member of the  Board
       as  of  the  adjournment of the Annual Meeting  shall  automatically
       receive an Option Award.  The number of shares to be covered  by  an
       individual  award  may  not exceed 5,000  shares,  with  such  limit
       subject to the provisions of Section 6.

     (c)     No Option granted under the Plan shall be transferable by  the
       optionee  other  than  by  will  or  by  the  laws  of  descent  and
       distribution,  and  such  Option shall be  exercisable,  during  the
       optionee's  lifetime,  only  by the optionee.   Notwithstanding  the
       foregoing,  the Board may set forth in a Stock Option Agreement,  at
       the   time  of  grant  or  thereafter,  that  the  Options  may   be
       transferred  to  members  of  the optionee's  immediate  family,  to
       trusts  solely for the benefit of such immediate family members  and
       to  partnerships in which such family members and/or trusts are  the
       only  partners.   For  this  purpose,  immediate  family  means  the
       optionee's  spouse,  parents, children, stepchildren,  grandchildren
       and  legal  dependants.   Any transfer of Options  made  under  this
       provision  will  not be effective until notice of such  transfer  is
       delivered to the Company.

     (d)  No Option or any part of an Option shall be exercisable:

      (i)  before the Eligible Director has served one term-year as a member of
          the Board since the date the Option was granted (as used herein, the
          term "term-year" means that period from one Annual Meeting to the
          subsequent Annual Meeting),

      (ii)  after the expiration of ten years from the date the Option  was
      granted,

      (iii)unless,  written  notice of the exercise  is  delivered  to  the
  Company specifying the
          number of shares to be purchased and payment in full is made  for
          the  shares of Common Stock being acquired thereunder at the time
          of exercise; such payment shall be made

          (A)  in United States dollars by certified check, or bank draft, or

          (B)  by tendering to the Company Common Stock shares owned by the
               person exercising the Option and having a fair market value
               equal to the cash exercise price applicable to such Option,
               such fair market value to be the average of the high and low
               sales prices of a Common Stock share on the date of exercise
               as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
               Transactions Tape or, if the New York Stock Exchange is closed
               on that date, on the last preceding date on which the New York
               Stock Exchange was open for trading, or

          (C)by  a  combination of United States dollars and  Common  Stock
             shares as aforesaid; and

       (iv)     unless  the person exercising the Option has been,  at  all
          times  during the period beginning with the date of grant of  the
          Option  and  ending  on  the date of such exercise,  an  Eligible
          Director of the Company, except that

          (A)if  such  a person shall cease to be such an Eligible Director
             for  reasons other than retirement or death, while holding  an
             Option  that has not expired and has not been fully exercised,
             such  person, at any time within one year after  the  date  he
             ceases to be such an Eligible Director (but in no event  after
             the  Option  has expired under the provisions of  subparagraph
             5(d) (ii) above), may exercise the Option with respect to  any
             Common  Stock shares as to which such person has not exercised
             the  Option  on  the  date the person ceased  to  be  such  an
             Eligible Director; or

          (B)if  such person shall cease to be such an Eligible Director by

             administrators  or distributees, as the case may  be,  may  at
             any  time following the date of retirement or death but in  no
             event  after the expiration of the Option period  set  for  in
             the  Stock Option Agreement, exercise the Option with  respect
             to  any shares of Common Stock as to which such person has not
             exercised the Option on the date the person ceased to be  such

                                        E-10-2
<PAGE>

          (C)  if any person who has ceased to be such an Eligible Director for
             reasons other than death, shall die holding an Option that has not
             been fully exercised, such person's executors, administrators,
             heirs or distributees, as the case may be, may, at any time within
             the greater of
             (1) one year after the date of death or
             (2) the remainder for the period in
             which such person could have exercised the Option had the person
             not died, (but in no event under either (1) or (2) after the
             Option has expired under the provisions of subparagraph 5(d) (ii)
             above), exercise the Option with respect to any shares as to which
             the decedent could have exercised the Option at the time of death.

             In  the  event  any  Option  is exercised  by  the  executors,
             administrators, legatees or distributees of the  estate  of  a
             deceased  optionee, the Company shall be under  no  obligation
             to  issue  stock  thereunder unless and until the  Company  is
             satisfied  that  the person or persons exercising  the  Option
             are  the  duly appointed legal representatives of the deceased
             optionee's  estate  or  the  proper legatees  or  distributees
             thereof.

     (e) Subject to subparagraph 5(d) (i) above, one-quarter (25%) of the total
       number  of shares of Common Stock covered by the Option shall become
       exercisable beginning on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary date
       of the grant of the Option or (b) the completion of one term-year
       following the grant of the Option; thereafter an additional one-quarter
       (25%) of the  shares  shall become exercisable annually on the earlier
       of (a)  the anniversary date of the grant of the Option or (b) the
       completion of an additional term-year of service as a member of the
       Board.

     (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,if an Option has been
       transferred  in  accordance with Section 5(c), the Option  shall  be
       exercisable solely by the transferee.  The Option shall remain subject
       to the provisions of the Plan, including that it will be exercisable
       only to the extent that the optionee or optionee's estate would have
       been entitled to exercise it if the optionee had not transferred the
       Option.  In the event of the death of the transferee prior to the
       expiration of the right to exercise the Option, the Option shall be
       exercisable by the executors,administrators, legatees and distributees
       of the transferee's estate, as the  case may be for a period of one year
       following the date of the transferee's death but in no event be
       exercisable after the expiration of the Option period set forth in the
       Stock Option Agreement. The Option shall be subject to such other rules
       as the Board shall determine.

     6.Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock:

     In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company
by  reason  of stock dividends, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations,
split-ups, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the  aggregate
number  and  kind of shares available under the Plan, and the number,  kind
and  price  of shares subject to outstanding Options shall be appropriately
adjusted by the Board, whose determination shall be conclusive.

     7.Miscellaneous Provisions:

     (a)     Except  as  expressly provided for in the  Plan,  no  Eligible
       Director  or  other  person shall have any  claim  or  right  to  be
       granted  an Option under the Plan.  Neither the Plan nor any  action
       taken  hereunder shall be construed as giving any Eligible  Director
       any right to be retained in the service of the Company.

     (b)  Except as provided for under Section 5(c), an optionee's rights and
       interest under the Plan may not be assigned or transferred in whole or
       in part either directly or by operation of law or otherwise (except in
       the event  of  an  optionee's death, by will or the laws of descent and
       distribution), including, but not by way of limitations, execution,
       levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge, bankruptcy or in any other
       manner, and no such right or interest of any participant in the Plan
       shall be subject to any obligation or liability of such participant.

    (c)  No Common Stock shares shall be issued hereunder unless counsel for
      the Company shall be satisfied that such issuance will be in compliance
      with applicable federal, state and other securities laws and regulations.

                                        E-10-3
<PAGE>


    (d)  It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue
      Common Stock shares upon exercise of an Option, that the optionee (or any
      beneficiary or person entitled to act under subparagraph 5(d) (iv) above)
      pay to the Company, upon its demand, such amount as may be requested by
      the Company for the purpose of satisfying any liability to withhold
      federal,state, local or foreign income or other taxes.  If the amount
      requested is not paid, the Company may refuse to issue Common Stock
      shares.

     (e)  The expenses of the Plan shall be borne by the Company.

     (f)     The Plan shall be unfunded.  The Company shall not be required
       to  establish  any  special or separate fund or to  make  any  other
       segregation  of  assets  to  assure  the  issuance  of  shares  upon
       exercise  of  any Option under the Plan and issuance of shares  upon
       exercise  of  Options  shall be subordinate to  the  claims  of  the
       Company's general creditors.

     (g)     By  accepting any Option or other benefit under the Plan, each
       optionee  and  each  person claiming under or  through  such  person
       shall  be  conclusively deemed to have indicated his acceptance  and
       ratification of, and consent to, any action taken under the Plan  by
       the Company or the Board.

     8.Amendment or Discontinuance:

     The Plan may be amended at any time and from time to time by the Board
as the Board shall deem advisable, including, but not limited to amendments
necessary to qualify for any exemption or to comply with applicable law  or
regulations  provided,  however, that except as  provided  in  Paragraph  6
above,  the Board may not, without further approval by the shareholders  of
the  Company  in accordance with Paragraph 10 below, increase  the  maximum
number  of shares of Common Stock as to which Options may be granted  under
the  Plan,  increase the number of shares subject to an Option, reduce  the
minimum Option exercise price described in subparagraph 5(a) above,  extend
the  period during which Options may be granted or exercised under the Plan
or  change the class of persons eligible to receive Options under the Plan.
No amendment of the Plan shall materially and adversely affect any right of
any  optionee  with respect to any Option theretofore granted without  such
optionee's written consent.

     9.   Termination:

     This  Plan shall terminate upon the earlier of the following dates  or
events to occur:

     (a)   upon  the adoption of a resolution of the Board terminating  the
     Plan; or

     (b)ten  years  from the date the Plan is initially  approved
        and  adopted  by  the  shareholders  of  the  Company  in
        accordance with Paragraph 10 below.

    10.Effective Date of Plan:

    The  Plan  shall become effective as of May 2, 2000 or such later  date
