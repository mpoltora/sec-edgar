               MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
         OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
        (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company") at March 31, 1996 and
December 31, 1995, the results of operations for the three months ended
March 31, 1996 and 1995, and cash flows for the three months ended
March 31, 1996 and 1995.  These condensed consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and the related notes included in the Company's 1995 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

First Quarter Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------

Sales
- ------

Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 1996 increased 11% over the prior
year to $3,669.  The consolidated sales growth resulted from a 12% increase
due to volume and a 1% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign
currency translation.  Changes in selling prices had no effect on total
sales growth.  Domestic sales increased 10% and international sales increased
12% (14% excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation).
Worldwide sales for the first quarter of 1995 increased 16% compared to the
first quarter of 1994.  Excluding the acquisitions of the UPSA Group, Matrix
Essentials, Inc. and Calgon Vestal Laboratories and the divestiture of
Xomed-Treace, Inc., sales increased 10% for the first quarter of 1995.
In general, the business of the Company's industry segments is not seasonal.

                   BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
               MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
         OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
        (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


Sales in the pharmaceutical products segment, which is the largest segment
at 59% of total Company sales, increased 14% over the first quarter of 1995
to $2,155.  Sales growth resulted from an increase in volume, with no effect
due to changes in selling prices and foreign currency translation.  Sales of
cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the segment, increased
8% to $738.  Sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, increased 47%.
PRAVACHOL* is benefiting from a number of clinical studies, including the
landmark Pravastatin Primary Prevention Study, demonstrating its potential
benefits for a wide range of patients.  The recently issued Cholesterol and
Recurrent Events (CARE) study is expected to yield additional benefits in
future quarters.   MONOPRIL*, a second generation ACE inhibitor with
once-a-day dosage, also contributed to the increase in cardiovascular sales.
Increases in sales of these products were partially offset by the 15%
decline in sales of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor sold primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN*.  This decrease is
primarily due to the loss of its patent exclusivity in the U.S. in February
1996 and in Germany in February 1995.   Sales of anti-cancer drugs increased
12% to $450, due to strong sales of TAXOL* (paclitaxel), the Company's
leading anti-cancer agent, and PARAPLATIN*.  These increases were partially
offset by decreases in sales of PLATINOL* and VEPESID*.  Anti-infective drug
sales increased 1% to $430.  Strong gains were recorded for VIDEX* and ZERIT*,
the Company's two antiretroviral agents, both of which benefited from positive
regulatory agency actions in the U.S. and Europe, expanding markets for both
of the products.  MAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable cephalosporin,
introduced in international markets in 1995 and recently approved for
marketing in the U.S., also contributed to the growth of anti-infectives.
Growth in these products was partially offset by decreases in DURICEF* and
CEFZIL*.  Sales of central nervous system drugs including BUSPAR*, the
Company's novel anti-anxiety agent, SERZONE*, an anti-depressant which
offers a low incidence of side effects, and STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal
spray analgesic, continued to experience very good growth.  Dermatological
drug sales increased primarily due to strong sales of DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3
analog for the treatment of moderate psoriasis.  Glucophage, an oral
medication for non-insulin dependent diabetes, launched in April 1995 in the
U.S., performed exceptionally well.  The Company expanded its market position
in the important Argentina pharmaceutical market, becoming the seventh largest
drug company there with the acquisition in March of Argentia SA, one of that
country's largest manufacturers and marketers of ethical pharmaceuticals.
Also, the integration of two other recent acquisitions is proceeding.  They
are A/S GEA, acquired in September 1995, a leading manufacturer and marketer
of branded generic products for the Scandinavian market, and Pharmavit,
acquired in January 1996, one of Hungary's leading manufacturers of
over-the-counter medicines, nutritional products and generic pharmaceuticals.
For the first quarter of 1995, sales of the pharmaceutical products segment
increased 13% over the first quarter of 1994 as a result of increases in sales
of anti-cancer, anti-infective, cardiovascular, central nervous system and
dermatological drugs.

          OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
         (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


In the medical devices segment, sales of $438 were 3% below prior year levels,
reflecting a 1% decrease due to selling prices and a 2% decrease due to volume.
Foreign currency translation had no effect on sales for the quarter.  The
Company continues to be the world market share leader in knee and hip
replacements as well as ostomy and modern wound care products and is developing
a number of new product enhancements in each of these categories. The
Company expects to launch a major new hip replacement device, the VERSYS* Hip
System, later this year.  The NEXGEN* Complete Knee Solution continues to gain
worldwide acceptance.  In addition, Seabrook Medical Systems, Inc. a
manufacturer and distributor of thermal therapy products, was acquired in
April 1996.  For the first quarter of 1995, medical devices segment sales
increased 9% (5% excluding the effect of the acquisition of Calgon Vestal
Laboratories and the divestiture of Xomed-Treace, Inc.) over the prior year
due to increased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy and wound care products.

Sales of the nonprescription health products segment increased 16% to $674,
reflecting a 16% increase due to volume, a 1% increase in selling prices, and
a 1% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency.  Nutritional
product sales also increased 16%.  Sales of ENFAMIL*, the Company's largest
selling infant formula, as well as NUTRAMIGEN* and LACTOFREE*, special infant
formulas, performed well.  During the first quarter, the Company was awarded
sole-source contracts for Oklahoma and the New England States Alliance under
the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program.  BOOST* and SUSTACAL*
nutritional beverages, launched directly to consumers in the fourth quarter
of 1995, also contributed to sales growth.  Sales of analgesics, increased
primarily due to the strong performance of EXCEDRIN*, the Company's leading
analgesic in the U.S.  Sales of the UPSA Group grew, driven by sales of
EFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN* and ASPIRINE UPSA* in Europe.  For the first quarter
of 1995, the nonprescription health products segment sales increased 26%
(an increase of 9% excluding the effect of the acquisition of the UPSA Group
in September, 1994) over the prior year, primarily due to increased sales of
infant formulas and analgesics.

Sales of the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 8% over the prior
year to $402, reflecting a 7% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to
selling prices, and a 1% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign
currency.  Sales of hair care products increased due to strong market growth
of HERBAL ESSENCES*, SYSTEME BIOLAGE* and INFUSIUM 23* complete lines of
shampoos and conditioners.  Haircoloring product sales increased, primarily
due to sales of NATURAL INSTINCTS* and salon haircolorings.  Skin care
products sales increased, primarily due to strong introductory sales of
KERI* facial care products in Japan.  For the first quarter of 1995, sales of
the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 32% (an increase of 11%
excluding the effect of the acquisition of Matrix Essentials, Inc. in
August, 1994) over the prior year, primarily due to increases in sales of
haircoloring and hair care products.

         OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
        (in millions of dollars, except per share amounts)


Cost of Products Sold and Operating Expenses
- --------------------------------------------

Total costs and expenses for the quarters ended March 31, 1996 and 1995, as a
percentage of sales, were 72.1% and 71.8%, respectively.  Cost of products
sold decreased to 25.5% of sales from 26.6%, in 1995 due to a favorable
product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies.  Expenditures for
advertising and promotion in support of new and existing products increased
14% to $427 from $375 in 1995 and, as a percentage of sales, increased to
11.6% from 11.4% in 1995.  The increase is primarily due to the incremental
spending over the prior year in support of nonprescription health products.
Marketing, selling, administrative and other expenses, as a percentage of
sales, were 26.8% in 1996 and 25.1%, in 1995.  Research and development
expenses increased 4% to $302 from $290 in 1995, and as a percentage of
sales were, 8.2% compared to 8.8%.  Pharmaceutical research and development
spending increased 3% over the prior year and as a percentage of
pharmaceutical sales, was 11.8% compared to 13.0% in 1995.

Earnings
- --------

Earnings before income taxes for the first quarter increased 10% to $1,022
from $932 in 1995.  Net earnings increased 11% to $726 from $657 and earnings
per share increased 12% to $1.44 from $1.29 in 1995.  The growth in earnings
per share exceeded the growth in net earnings by 1% as a result of the
Company's share repurchase program.  The effective tax rate on earnings before
taxes decreased to 29.0% in the first quarter of 1996 from 29.5% in 1995,
reflecting the benefit of increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.

Financial Position
- ------------------

The balance sheet at March 31, 1996 and the statement of cash flows for the
three months then ended reflect the Company's strong financial position.  The
Company continues to maintain a high level of working capital totaling
approximately $2 billion at March 31, 1996.

Internally generated funds continue to be the Company's primary source for
financing expenditures for new plant and equipment.  Additions to fixed
assets for the three months ended March 31, 1996 were $115 compared to $90
during the same period of 1995.

During the three months ended March 31, 1996, the Company purchased 3,082,200
shares of its common stock at a total cost of $264.  On March 5, 1996, the
authorization for the Company's current share repurchase program was increased
from 50 million shares to 75 million shares.

are described for various lawsuits, claims and proceedings in which the Company
is involved.

                    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
                   ----------------------------


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its
business are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.  The
most significant of these are reported in the Company's Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1995 with material developments since that
report described below.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K referred to above, the
Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are defendants in a number of
antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of purported statewide
classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products and by the Attorneys
General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging a price fixing
conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade practices
laws and seeking damages and/or penalties and other relief.  On December 6,
1995, a trial in state court in Wichita, Kansas in which the Company and
Abbott Laboratories were defendants concluded with a jury verdict in favor of
the defendants.  The court subsequently denied the plaintiff's motion for a
new trial, and the plaintiff has appealed.  Courts in Colorado, Florida,
Kentucky, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee have dismissed similar
complaints, and the plaintiffs have appealed or are expected to appeal those
dismissals.  In Colorado, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the trial
court's dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint.  In Tennessee, the
intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the
plaintiff's case.  The intermediate appellate court found that the plaintiff
has standing, that the plaintiff must show a predominately intrastate
conspiracy under state law and that there was not yet sufficient information
in the record to determine whether the conspiracy alleged was intrastate or
interstate in scope.  In Florida, the intermediate appellate court reversed
the trial court's dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint for lack of standing
under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act but certified the
issue to the Florida Supreme Court.  Motions to certify classes of indirect
purchasers of infant formula have been denied in Minnesota, in Michigan and
by two courts in Alabama, and have been granted in Kansas, Wisconsin and
South Dakota.

Pharmaceutical Pricing Litigation
- ---------------------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Form 10-K referred to above, the
Company is a defendant in over 100 class and individual antitrust actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers by retailers
that have been coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  On April 4, 1996, the Court
declined to approve a settlement that had previously been reached by the
Company and certain other defendants with the plaintiffs in the class action.

                               -10-

                    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
                   ----------------------------


The Court also denied motions for summary judgment as against the conspiracy
claims of the class and individual plaintiffs that had been made by the drug
manufacturer defendants, including the Company; denied motions made by the
drug manufacturer defendants for summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs'
damage claims based on purchases of drugs from wholesalers; and granted a
motion for summary judgment on behalf of certain wholesalers that are
defendants in the class action.  Defendants who had participated in the class
action settlement filed a motion for reconsideration of or leave to appeal
from the order denying approval of the settlement.  The Company and certain
of the other manufacturer defendants who participated in the settlement
subsequently reached an agreement with the class plaintiffs on an amendment
to the settlement agreement that the Company believes will resolve the
concerns raised by the Court.  The class settlement as amended was
preliminarily approved by the Court on May 8 and any objections by class
members to Court approval will be heard on June 11, 1996.  The Company and
other drug manufacturers are seeking leave to appeal the order containing
the denial of summary judgment with respect to damage claims based on
purchases of drugs from wholesalers.  The defendant wholesalers have asked
the Court to enter final judgment dismissing them from the case.  Certain of
the class plaintiffs have made, and the Court has presently denied, motions
for a preliminary injunction concerning the alleged pricing practices of the
defendant manufacturers, including the Company.  The May 7, 1996 date for
commencement of trial of the class action has been vacated, and the Court has
not set a new date.  In the state court litigation pending in California, a
class action complaint has been filed on behalf of consumers who purchase from
California chain pharmacies, and an individual complaint on behalf of certain
California chain pharmacies has also been filed.  The judge presiding over the
retailer case pending in Alabama state court has recused himself, and a new
judge has been appointed.  In the retailer case pending in Wisconsin state
court, a motion to dismiss made by the Company and certain other defendants
has been denied.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
- ------------------------------------------------------------

      required by this bylaw, or the books of the Company or to vote in
      person or by proxy at any meeting of shareholders.

      these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the
      shareholders.


15.   (a) The Board of Directors shall consist of ten directors.  Directors

      (b) Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, by
          these bylaws or by law, at each meeting of the shareholders for the
          election of directors at which a quorum shall be present, the
          persons receiving a plurality of the votes cast shall be directors.
          Such election shall be by ballot.

      (c) The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of
          any class or series of stock having a preference over the
          Common Stock  as to dividends or upon liquidation, shall be
          classified, with respect to the time for which they severally hold
          office, into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible,
          as determined by the Board of Directors, one class to be originally
          elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
          to be held in 1985, another class to be originally elected for a
          term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in
          1986, and another class to be originally elected for a term expiring
          at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 1987, with the
          directors of each class to hold office until their successors are
          elected and qualified.  At each annual meeting of the stockholders,
          the successors of the class of directors whose term expires at that
          meeting shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the
          annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the
          year of their election.  No decrease in the number of directors
          constituting the Board of Directors or change in the restrictions
          and qualifications for directors shall shorten the term of any
          incumbent director.

      (d) Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation
          or in these bylaws, each director shall continue in office until
          the expiration of his term of office and until a successor shall
          have been elected and shall have qualified, or until the director
          shall have resigned, or, in the case of a director who is an
          employee of the Company, until the director shall have resigned
          from employment with the Company or the director's employment shall
          have been terminated by the Company.  In addition, a director who
          is not an employee of the Company or who is the Chief Executive
          Officer of the Company or a retired Chief Executive Officer of the
          Company shall retire from the position of director at the Annual
          Meeting following attainment of age 70; an employee who is a director
          of the Company (other than the Chief Executive Officer or a retired
          Chief Executive Officer) shall retire from the position of director
          on the effective date of the director's retirement as an employee
          of the Company.  Any director of the Company may resign at any time
          by giving written notice to the Chairman of the Board or to the
          Secretary of the Company.  Such resignation shall take effect at
          the time specified therein; and, unless otherwise specified therein,
          the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make
          it effective.  Exceptions to the requirements for the retirement
          of a director may be made by the Board of Directors.

      (e) Subject to the rights under Article FOURTH of the Certificate of
          Incorporation of any class or series of stock having a preference
          over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect
          directors under specified circumstances, any director or entire
          class of directors or the entire Board of Directors may be removed

          and such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of

      or agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the
      Company by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to
      render it pecuniarily liable for any purpose or to any amount.

43.   No loans shall be contracted on behalf of the Company and no negotiable
      paper shall be issued in its name unless authorized by resolution of
      the Board of Directors.  When authorized by the Board of Directors, any
      officer or agent of the Company thereunto authorized may effect loans
      and advances at any time for the Company from any bank, trust company,
      or other institution, or from any firm, corporation or individual, and
      for such loans and advances may make, execute and deliver promissory
      notes, bonds, or other certificates or evidences of indebtedness of the
      Company and, when authorized so to do, may pledge, hypothecate or
      transfer any securities or other property of the Company as security
      for any such loans or advances.  Such authority may be general or
      confined to specified instances.

44.   All checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of moneys out of
      the funds of the Company and all notes or other evidences of
      indebtedness of the Company shall be signed on behalf of the Company
      in such manner as shall from time to time be determined by resolution
      of the Board of Directors.

45.   All funds of the Company not otherwise employed shall be deposited
      from time to time to the credit of the Company in such banks, trust
      companies or other depositories as the Board of Directors may

                                   E-3-15

<PAGE>





      select or as may be selected by any officer or officers, agent or agents
      of the Company to whom such power may from time to time be delegated by
      the Board of Directors; and for the purpose of such deposit, the
      Chairman of the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the President,
      a Vice President, the Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any
      other officer or agent or employee of the Company to whom such power
      may be delegated by the Board of Directors, may endorse, assign and
      deliver checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of moneys which
      are payable to the order of the Company.


CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFERS OF SHARES.
- -------------------------------------

46.   The shares of the Company shall be represented by certificates or shall
      be uncertificated.  Each registered holder of shares, upon request to
      the Company, shall be provided with a certificate of stock, representing
      the number of shares owned by such holder.  Certificates for shares of
      the Company shall be in such form as shall be approved by the Board of
      Directors. Such certificates shall be numbered and registered in the
      order in which they are issued and shall be signed by the Chairman of
      the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board, the President or a Vice
      President and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer
      or an Assistant Treasurer.  Where any such certificate is countersigned
      by a transfer agent, other than the Company or its employee, or by a
      registrar, other than the Company or its employee, any other signature
      on such certificate may be a facsimile, engraved, stamped or printed.
      In the event that an officer whose facsimile signature appears on such
      certificate ceases for any reason to hold the office indicated and the
      Company or its transfer agent has on hand a supply of share certificates
      bearing such officer's facsimile signature, such certificates may
      continue to be issued and registered until such supply is exhausted.

47.   Transfers of shares of the Company shall be made only on the books of
      the Company by the holder thereof, or by the holder's attorney thereunto
      duly authorized and on either the surrender of the certificate or
      certificates for such shares properly endorsed or upon receipt of
      proper transfer instructions from the registered owner of uncertificated
      shares.  Every certificate surrendered to the Company shall be marked
      "Canceled," with the date of cancellation, and no new certificate shall
      be issued in exchange therefor until the old certificate has been
      surrendered and canceled, except as hereinafter provided. Uncertificated
      shares shall be canceled and issuance of new equivalent uncertificated
      shares shall be made to the person entitled thereto and the transaction
      shall be recorded upon the books of the Company.

48.   The holder of any shares of the Company shall immediately notify the
      Company of any loss, destruction or mutilation of the certificate
      therefor and the Company may issue a new certificate in the place of
      any certificate theretofore issued by it alleged to have been lost,
      destroyed or mutilated.  The Board of Directors may, in its discretion,
      as conditions to the issue of any such new certificate, require the
      owner of the lost or destroyed certificate or the owner's legal
      representatives to make proof satisfactory to the Board of Directors
      of the loss or destruction thereof and to give the Company a bond in
      such form, in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board
      of Directors may direct, to indemnify the Company against any claim
      that may be made against it on account of any such certificate so
      alleged to have been lost or destroyed.

DETERMINATION OF RECORD DATE.
- -----------------------------

49.   In order that the Company may determine the shareholders entitled to
      notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment
      Thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
      distribution or allotment of any rights or entitled to exercise any
      rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or
      for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors
      may fix in advance a record date which shall not be more than 60 nor
      less than 10 days before the date of such meeting nor more than 60 days
      prior to any other action.

      If no record date is fixed:

       (i)     The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice
               of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the
               close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
               notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of
               business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting
               is held.

       (ii)    The record date for determining shareholders for any other
               purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which
               the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

      A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to
      vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
      meeting provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new
      record date for the adjourned meeting.


REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS.
- ------------------------

50. The company shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share
    or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall
    not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
    in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall
    have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the
    laws of Delaware.


FISCAL YEAR.
- ------------

51. The fiscal year shall begin on the first day of January and end on the
    thirty-first day of December in each year.


NOTICES.

52. Whenever under the provision of these bylaws notice is required to be
    given to any director or shareholder, it shall be construed to mean
    personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, by
    depositing the same in a post office or letter box, in a postpaid sealed
    wrapper,

                                   E-3-17

<PAGE>


    addressed to such director or shareholder at such address as appears on
    the books of the Company, or, in default of other address, to such
    director or shareholder, at the General Post Office in the City of
    Wilmington, Delaware, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the
    time when the same shall be thus mailed.

53. Any notice required to be given under these bylaws may be waived in
    writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether
    before or after the time stated therein.


AMENDMENTS.
- -----------

54. Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
    Company and consistent therewith, these bylaws may be altered, amended or
    repealed or new bylaws may be made by the affirmative vote of the holders
    of record of a majority of the shares of the Company entitled to vote,
    at any annual or special meeting, provided that such proposed action
    shall be stated in the notice of such meeting, or, by a vote of the
    majority of the whole Board of Directors, at any regular meeting without
    notice, or at any special meeting provided that notice of such proposed
    action shall be stated in the notice of such special meeting.
