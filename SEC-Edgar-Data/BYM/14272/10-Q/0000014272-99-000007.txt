              ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
               FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
                                (UNAUDITED)


Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------

In   the  opinion  of  management,  the  accompanying  unaudited
consolidated   financial  statements  include  all   adjustments
(consisting  only of normal adjustments) necessary  for  a  fair
presentation  of the financial position of Bristol-Myers  Squibb
Company (the "Company") at June 30, 1999 and December 31,  1998,
the  results  of operations for the three and six  months  ended
June  30, 1999 and 1998, and cash flows for the six months ended
June 30, 1999 and 1998.  These consolidated financial statements
should  be  read in conjunction with the consolidated  financial
statements and the related notes included in the Company's  1998
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Second Quarter Results of Operations
- ------------------------------------

Worldwide  sales  for the second quarter of 1999  increased  11%
over  the prior year to $4,920 million.  The consolidated  sales
growth resulted from a 10% increase due to volume, a 2% increase
due  to  changes  in  selling prices and a 1%  decrease  due  to
foreign  exchange rate fluctuations.  U.S. sales  increased  19%
and  international  sales  remained at  prior  year  levels  (an
increase of 3% excluding the effect of foreign exchange).

Sales  in  the medicines products segment, which is the  largest
segment  at 70% of total Company sales, increased 15%  over  the
second   quarter   of   1998  to  $3,435   million.    Worldwide
pharmaceutical  sales  increased 17%  with  U.S.  pharmaceutical
sales  up  29% over the prior year. Sales growth in  the  second
quarter resulted from a 14% increase in volume, a 2% increase in
selling  prices and a 1% decrease due to foreign  exchange  rate
fluctuations.

Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in  the
segment,  increased 20% to $881 million (22%  excluding  foreign
exchange).   Sales of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's largest  selling
product,  increased  5% to $380 million.   Sales  of  the  anti-
hypertensive   MONOPRIL*,   a  second   generation   angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, increased 9% to $116 million.
PLAVIX,  a  platelet aggregation inhibitor for the reduction  of
stroke,  heart  attack  and  vascular death  in  atherosclerotic
patients  with recent stroke, recent heart attack or  peripheral
arterial  disease, had sales of $128 million  for  the  quarter.
AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment  of
hypertension,  had sales of $64 million. AVAPRO and  PLAVIX  are
cardiovascular  products that were launched  from  the  Bristol-
Myers  Squibb  and Sanofi S.A. joint venture. In May  1999,  the
Company  and Sanofi S.A. announced the availability in the  U.S.
of  the  anti-hypertensive AVALIDE, an angiotensin  II  receptor
blocker  combined  with a thiazide diuretic.  Sales  growth  for
these  cardiovascular products was partially offset  by  an  18%
decline  in CAPOTEN* sales due to the loss of patent exclusivity
in international markets.

Sales of anti-cancer drugs increased 19% to $852 million.  Sales
of  TAXOL*  (paclitaxel),  the  Company's  leading  anti-cancer
agent, increased 19% to $362 million as the product continues to
benefit from increased use in ovarian, breast and non-small cell
lung  cancer. In April 1999, the Company applied for  regulatory
approval  to  extend  the use of TAXOL* to treat  breast  cancer
patients following surgery.  In June 1999, the Company submitted
a  regulatory  application to the Food and  Drug  Administration
(FDA)  to  gain  marketing  approval  for  TAXOL*  injection  in
combination  with  Genentech, Inc's Herceptin  r  as  first-line
therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer.  Also in  June,
the  Company filed for European marketing authorization  to  the
Dutch  Health Authorities for the use of TAXOL* for the adjuvant
treatment of node-positive breast cancer.  Sales of PARAPLATIN*,
an anti-cancer agent used in combination with other chemotherapy
agents,  increased  11% to $138 million.   Sales  from  Oncology
Therapeutics  Network  (OTN), a specialty distributor  of  anti-
cancer  medicines and related products, increased  41%  to  $219
million.

prior  year.    ZERIT*  and  VIDEX*,  the  Company's  two  anti-
retroviral agents, increased 19% to $151 million and 41% to  $55
million,  respectively.  ZERIT* is  one  of  the  most  commonly
prescribed thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase  inhibitor
in  HIV therapy in most major markets in the world.  During  the
quarter,  the European Union gave a mutual recognition agreement
on  the  once-daily dosing of VIDEX* for the treatment  of  HIV.
International sales of MAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable
cephalosporin,  increased 19% to $32  million  in  the  quarter.
Effective  January  1,  1999,  Dura  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.  was
appointed the exclusive distributor for MAXIPIME* in the  United
States.

The  Company is committing $100 million over the next five years
in  connection with the Secure the Future program,  whose  goals
are  to  speed  research, train doctors  and  enhance  community
outreach to fight HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa.

treatment  of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, continued
its  strong  growth  rate  with sales  increasing  47%  to  $350
million.  In  May 1999, the FDA approved AVANDIA in  combination
with  GLUCOPHAGE for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.   AVANDIA
is  a product of SmithKline Beecham, and is being co-promoted by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in the United States.

partially  offset  by  increases in cost of  goods  sold,  as  a
percentage of sales.

Sales  in  the  beauty care products segment  increased  4%  (5%
excluding  the  effect  of foreign exchange)  to  $626  million.
Sales  growth in the second quarter resulted from a 3%  increase
in volume, a 2% increase in selling prices and a 1% decrease due
to  foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Clairol continues to be
the   number  one  hair  products  company  in  the  U.S.    The
introduction of a demand management manufacturing system  slowed
shipments  during the quarter. HERBAL ESSENCES*, the number  two
brand  in the U.S. shampoo/conditioner category and number three
in   the  body  wash  category,  continued  its  strong  growth,
increasing 16% to $159 million.  HERBAL ESSENCES FACIAL CARE*, a
line  of  skin  care products, was launched in March  1999,  and
contributed $6 million in second quarter sales. AUSSIE* products

second quarter, following its launch into international markets.
Earnings  before taxes for the beauty care segment decreased  to
$44  million in 1999 from $89 million in 1998, primarily due  to
the introduction of a demand management manufacturing system.

Sales  in the nutritional products segment increased 4% to  $438
million  (6%  excluding the effect of foreign  exchange).   U.S.
sales   increased  7%  and  international  sales  decreased   1%
primarily due to market conditions in Asia.  Sales growth in the
second  quarter  resulted from a 4% increase  in  volume,  a  2%
increase  in  selling prices and a 2% decrease  due  to  foreign
exchange   rate   fluctuations.  The  Company's   Mead   Johnson
subsidiary  continues  to  build  on  its  U.S.  and   worldwide
leadership position in the infant formula market.  ENFAMIL*, the
Company's largest-selling infant formula, recorded sales of $163
million,  a  5% increase over the prior year. BOOST*,  an  adult
nutritional  supplement,  also  contributed  to  sales   growth,
increasing  45%  to  $29 million. In March  1999,  Mead  Johnson
Nutritionals introduced VIACTIV* Soft Calcium Chews  to  address
the  need for a convenient, great-tasting calcium supplement for
women.   Sales  of  VIACTIV* reached $6 million  in  the  second
quarter.   Earnings  before taxes for  the  nutritional  segment
decreased  to $71 million in 1999 from $74 million in 1998,  and

in 1998 primarily due to market conditions in Asia.

Medical  device  segment sales increased  4%  to  $421  million,
excluding  sales  from a 1998 distribution  agreement  with  the
acquirer  of Zimmer's divested arthroscopy and powered  surgical
instrument  business.   On  this  basis,  medical  device  sales
increased  5% due to volume and decreased 1% due to  changes  in
selling  prices. Fluctuations in foreign exchange had no  effect
on  medical  devices  sales.  Zimmer sales on  this  same  basis
increased  7%  to $240 million (6% excluding foreign  exchange).
Knee  joint  replacement sales increased 12% to $95 million  and
hip  replacement  sales increased 9% to $72  million.   ConvaTec
sales  increased  1%  to  $180  million  (2%  excluding  foreign
exchange).   Sales  of  ostomy products  increased  2%  to  $116
million partially offset by a decrease in wound care products of
3% to $56 million.  Earnings before taxes for the medical device
segment increased 12% to $91 million in 1999 from $81 million in
1998  and, as a percentage of sales, increased to 21.6% in  1999
from  19.4%  in  1998,  primarily due to improved  manufacturing
efficiencies.

Operating Expenses
- ------------------

Total  expenses  for  the quarter ended  June  30,  1999,  as  a
percentage  of  sales, decreased to 73.2% from 73.7% in 1998. Cost
of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 27.7% from
27.2%  in  1998  due  to  revenue growth of  OTN  which  carries
significantly  lower margins.  Expenditures for advertising  and
promotion  in support of new and existing products increased  4%
to   $666   million  from  $642  million.   Marketing,  selling,
administrative  and  other  expenses  increased  9%  to   $1,122
million. Research and development expenditures increased 18%  to
$453 million from $384 million in 1998.  Pharmaceutical research
and  development spending increased 19% over the prior year, and
as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.7% in the second
quarter  of  1999 and 12.6% in the second quarter  of  1998.  In
research  and development highlights this quarter, data  on  the
Company's  new  novel cardiovascular agent in Phase  II  trials,
VANLEV*  (omapatrilat), were presented at the American  Society
of  Hypertension.   The  Phase II results  showed  that  use  of
VANLEV* was effective in reducing both systolic (top number) and
diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure.  The Company plans  to
file for regulatory approval for VANLEV* with the FDA by the end
of  the  year  with worldwide regulatory filings to follow.  The
Company  is  also awaiting marketing approval from the  FDA  for
ORZEL*  (UFT),  an  oral  therapy for  colorectal  cancer,  and
TEQUIN*  (gatifloxacin), a broad-spectrum quinolone  antibiotic
for the treatment of multiple common infections, including those
of the respiratory tract.

Earnings
- --------

Earnings  before  income taxes for the second quarter  increased
13% to $1,318 million from $1,164 million in 1998. The effective
tax  rate on earnings before income taxes decreased to 27.8%  in
1999  from 28.3% in 1998. The decrease in the effective tax rate
is  due to increased earnings from lower tax rate jurisdictions.
Net  earnings  increased 14% to $952 million from $835  million
in 1998. Basic earnings per share increased 14% to $.48 from $.42
in 1998 and  diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $.47 from

by  a  22% decline in CAPOTEN* sales, due to the loss of  patent
exclusivity  in  international markets.   Sales  of  anti-cancer

million  (3%  excluding the effect of foreign exchange).   Sales
growth for the six months resulted from a 2% increase in volume,
a 1% increase in selling prices and a 1% decrease due to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations. Total infant formula sales increased
2% to $605 million.  ENFAMIL* recorded sales of $350 million,  a
