                       BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
             (Unaudited, in millions except per share amounts)


Note 1:   Basis of Presentation
- -------------------------------

In   the  opinion  of  management,  the  accompanying  unaudited
consolidated   financial  statements  include  all   adjustments
(consisting  only of normal adjustments) necessary  for  a  fair
presentation  of the financial position of Bristol-Myers  Squibb
Company  (the "Company") at September 30, 1999 and December  31,
1998,  the  results of operations for the three and nine  months
ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998, and cash flows for the  nine
months  ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998.  These  consolidated
financial  statements  should be read in  conjunction  with  the
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included
in   the   Company's   1998  Annual   Report   on   Form   10-K.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent  auditors,
have  performed a review of the unaudited consolidated financial
statements  included  herein, and their  review  report  thereon
accompanies this filing.

Note 2:   Accounting Policies
- -----------------------------

Basis  of  Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all  of
its subsidiaries.

Cash  and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily
include  securities with a maturity of three months or  less  at
the  time  of  purchase,  recorded at cost,  which  approximates
market.

Time  Deposits  and  Marketable Securities - Time  deposits  and
marketable securities are available for sale and are recorded at
fair value, which approximates cost.

Inventory  Valuation  -  Inventories  are  generally  stated  at
average cost, not in excess of market. As of September 30, 1999,
the  amounts  of finished goods, work in process,  and  raw  and
packaging  materials  were $1,362, $340 and $350,  respectively.
These  amounts  as  of December 31, 1998 were $1,209,  $236  and
$428, respectively.

Capital  Assets  and Depreciation - Expenditures for  additions,
renewals  and betterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation
is  generally computed by the straight-line method based on  the
estimated  useful  lives of the related assets.   The  estimated
useful  lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are  50
years  for  buildings and 3 to 40 years for machinery, equipment
and fixtures.  Accumulated depreciation as of September 30, 1999
and   December   31,  1998  amounted  to  $3,234   and   $3,079,
respectively.

Excess  of  Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess  of  cost
over  net tangible assets arising from business acquisitions  is
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from  15
to  40  years.  The excess of cost over net tangible  assets  is
periodically  reviewed for impairment based on an assessment  of
future operations (including cash flows) to ensure the excess of
cost over net tangible assets is appropriately valued.

                                -6-
<PAGE>

Product   Liability   -  Accruals  for  product  liability   are
recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable  that  a
liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability  can
be  reasonably  estimated, based on existing information.  These
accruals   are  adjusted  periodically  as  assessment   efforts
progress   or  as  additional  information  becomes   available.
Receivables   for  related  insurance  or  other   third   party
recoveries   for  product  liabilities  are  recorded,   on   an
undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will  be
realized.   Insurance recoverable recorded on the balance  sheet
has, in general, payment terms of three years or less.

Revenue  Recognition - Revenue from product sales is  recognized
upon shipment to customers.

Note 3: Earnings Per Share
- --------------------------

Basic  earnings per common share are computed using the weighted
average  number of shares outstanding during the year.   Diluted
earnings  per  common  share  are computed  using  the  weighted
average  number of shares outstanding during the year, plus  the
incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive
stock  options.  The computations for basic earnings per  common
share and diluted earnings per common share are as follows:


                                Three Months Ended      Nine Months Ended

                  Report of Independent Accountants



To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

We  have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
Bristol-Myers  Squibb  Company  and  its  subsidiaries   as   of
September  30, 1999, and the related consolidated  statement  of
earnings  and  comprehensive income for each of the  three-month
and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the
consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine-month  periods
ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998.  These financial  statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with standards established
by  the  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.   A
review of interim financial information consists principally  of
applying  analytical  procedures to financial  data  and  making
inquiries  of  persons responsible for financial and  accounting
matters.   It  is  substantially less in  scope  than  an  audit
conducted   in  accordance  with  generally  accepted   auditing
standards,  the  objective of which  is  the  expression  of  an
opinion  regarding the financial statements taken  as  a  whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based   on  our  review,  we  are  not  aware  of  any  material
modifications   that   should  be  made  to   the   accompanying
consolidated  interim financial statements for  them  to  be  in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

We  previously  audited  in accordance with  generally  accepted
auditing  standards,  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as   of
December  31,  1998, and the related consolidated statements  of
earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our
report  dated  January  20,  1999 we  expressed  an  unqualified
opinion  on  those  consolidated financial statements.   In  our
opinion,   the   information  set  forth  in  the   accompanying
consolidated  balance sheet as of December 31,  1998  is  fairly
stated  in all material respects in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Item 2.     Management's  Discussion and Analysis  of  Financial
            Condition and Results of Operations


Third Quarter Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------

Worldwide sales for the third quarter of 1999 increased 11% over
the prior year to $5,040 million.  The consolidated sales growth
resulted from a 10% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to
changes  in  selling  prices and a 1% decrease  due  to  foreign
exchange  rate  fluctuations.   U.S.  sales  increased  15%  and
international  sales increased 5% (7% excluding  the  effect  of
foreign exchange).

Sales  in  the medicines products segment, which is the  largest
segment  at 70% of total Company sales, increased 14%  over  the
third  quarter of 1998 to $3,548 million.  Sales growth resulted
from  a  13% increase in volume, a 3% increase in selling prices
and  a  2%  decrease due to foreign exchange rate  fluctuations.
Worldwide   pharmaceutical  sales  increased   15%   with   U.S.
pharmaceutical sales up 22% over the prior year.

Sales of cardiovascular drugs increased 12% to $871 million (14%
excluding  foreign exchange). Sales of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's
largest selling product, decreased 1% to $386 million. Sales  of
the anti-hypertensive MONOPRIL*, a second generation angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, increased 9% to $94  million.
PLAVIX(R), a platelet aggregation inhibitor for the reduction of
stroke,  heart  attack  and  vascular death  in  atherosclerotic
patients with recent stroke, heart attack or peripheral arterial
disease,  had sales of $148 million compared to $45 million  for
the same quarter last year. AVAPRO(r), an angiotensin II receptor
blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 55% to  $62
million. AVAPRO(r) and PLAVIX(r) are cardiovascular products that
were  launched  from the Bristol-Myers Squibb  and  Sanofi  S.A.
joint  venture.  Sales growth for these cardiovascular  products
was  partially offset by a 23% decline in CAPOTEN* sales due  to
the loss of patent exclusivity in international markets.

Sales  of  anti-cancer drugs, the largest product group  in  the
segment,  increased  16%  to  $898  million.   Sales  of  TAXOL*
(paclitaxel), the Company's leading anti-cancer agent, increased
23%  to  $375  million as the product continues to benefit  from
increased use in ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer.
Sales  from  Oncology Therapeutics Network  (OTN),  a  specialty
distributor  of  anti-cancer  medicines  and  related  products,
increased 38% to $236 million.

Anti-infective drug sales of $602 million increased 3% over  the
prior year.   Sales of ZERIT* and VIDEX*, the Company's two anti-
retroviral agents, increased 17% to $155 million and 14%
to $49 million, respectively.  International sales of MAXIPIME*,
a  fourth generation injectable cephalosporin, increased 35%  to
$31 million in the quarter.

Central nervous system drug sales of $314 million increased  16%
with  sales  of BUSPAR*, an anti-anxiety agent, and SERZONE*,  a
novel  anti-depressant, increasing 12% to $155 million, and  41%
to $86 million, respectively.

the Company.

                                -9-
<PAGE>

GLUCOPHAGE(r), the leading  branded  oral  medication  for   the
treatment  of non-insulin dependent (type 2) diabetes, continued
its  strong  growth  rate  with sales  increasing  57%  to  $349
million.

Analgesic sales increased 11% to $180 million.  EXCEDRIN*  sales
increased  5% to $61 million, BUFFERIN* sales increased  19%  to
$32  million and sales of EFFERALGAN*, an effervescent analgesic
sold  primarily  in  France, increased 3% to  $33  million.   In
October 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the
EXCEDRIN* migraine  indication from  just  the treatment of mild
to moderate  migraine  pain  to encompass  even the  severe pain
and  associated  symptoms  of  the full migraine syndrome.  Also
in October, the  Company  introduced THERAGRAN  HEART  RIGHT*, a
complete multivitamin with a  formula  specially created to help
support a healthy heart.

Earnings  before  taxes  for  the  medicines  products   segment
increased  20%  to $1,049 million in 1999. As  a  percentage  of
sales, earnings before taxes for this segment improved to  29.6%
in  1999  from 28.2% in 1998.  Advertising and promotion,  sales
force  and  general  administrative  expenses  improved,  as   a
percentage  of sales, partially offset by increases in  cost  of
goods sold, as a percentage of sales.

Sales  in  the  beauty care products segment  increased  5%  (4%
excluding  the  effect  of foreign exchange)  to  $624  million.
Sales  growth  resulted  from a 2%  increase  in  volume,  a  2%
increase  in  selling prices and a 1% increase  due  to  foreign
exchange rate fluctuations.  Clairol continues to be the  number
one  hair  products company in the U.S.  The introduction  of  a
demand  management manufacturing system slowed shipments  during
the  quarter. HERBAL ESSENCES*, the number two brand in the U.S.
shampoo/conditioner category and number three in the  body  wash
category,  continued its strong growth, increasing  6%  to  $163
million.   AUSSIE*  products contributed $32  million  to  third
quarter  sales,  an  increase of 7%.  Sales  of  DAILY  DEFENSE*
increased  12%  to  $29  million,  following  its  launch   into
international  markets.  Haircolor sales increased  12%  due  to
increases  in  NICE 'N EASY* of 24% to $56 million  and  NATURAL
INSTINCTS* of 24% to $26 million.  Earnings before taxes for the
beauty  care products segment decreased to $92 million  in  1999
from $96 million in 1998, primarily due to the introduction of a
demand management manufacturing system.

Sales  in the nutritional products segment increased 6% to  $466
million.  Sales growth resulted from an 8% increase in volume, a
2%  decrease  in  selling prices and no effect  due  to  foreign
exchange   rate   fluctuations.  The  Company's   Mead   Johnson
subsidiary  continues  to  build  on  its  U.S.  and   worldwide
leadership position in the infant formula market. ENFAMIL*,  the
Company's largest-selling infant formula, recorded sales of $176
million, an increase of 1% over the prior year. BOOST*, an adult
nutritional  supplement,  also  contributed  to  sales   growth,
increasing  38%  to  $33 million and sales of  VIACTIV*  Calcium
Chews  reached  $10  million.  Earnings  before  taxes  for  the
nutritional  segment increased to $96 million in 1999  from  $91
million in 1998, and as a percentage of sales, remained at prior
year  levels  of approximately 20.6%.  Sales force  and  general
administrative  expenses  improved as  a  percentage  of  sales,
offset  by  increases in cost of goods sold and advertising  and
promotion expenses, as a percentage of sales.

                                -10-
<PAGE>

Medical  device segment sales increased 4% to $402 million,  due
to  volume  increases  of 3% and increases  due  to  changes  in
selling  prices of 1%. Fluctuations in foreign exchange  had  no
effect on medical devices sales.  Zimmer sales increased  8%  to
$226  million  (5%  excluding  foreign  exchange).   Knee  joint
replacement  sales  increased  13%  to  $88  million   and   hip
replacement sales increased 14% to $67 million.  ConvaTec  sales
remained  at  prior year levels at $176 million (a  1%  increase
excluding  foreign  exchange).   Sales  of  modern  wound   care
products  increased  5%  to $62 million while  sales  of  ostomy
products  decreased 11% to $100 million.  Earnings before  taxes
for  the medical device segment increased 15% to $91 million  in
1999  from  $79 million in 1998 and, as a percentage  of  sales,
increased to 22.6% in 1999 from 20.5% in 1998, primarily due  to
improved manufacturing processes.


Operating Expenses
- ------------------

Total  expenses,  as a percentage of sales, decreased  to  69.9%
from  70.2% in 1998.  Cost of products sold, as a percentage  of
sales,  increased  to 27.8% from 26.3% in 1998  due  to  revenue
growth  of  Oncology  Therapeutics Network (OTN)  which  carries
significantly  lower margins. Excluding OTN,  cost  of  products
sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 24.5% in 1999  from
23.6% in 1998 due primarily to decreased sales of CAPOTEN* and a
product  mix  shift  to  lower margin  pharmaceutical  products.
Expenditures for advertising and promotion in support of new and
existing  products  increased  3%  to  $573  million  from  $554
million.

Marketing,  selling  administrative and  other  expenses,  as  a
percentage of sales, decreased to 21.7% in the third quarter  of
1999  from 22.9% in the third quarter of 1998, primarily due  to
sales    force   effectiveness   and   reductions   in   general
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.  Research  and
development expenditures increased 14% to $452 million from $398
million   in  1998.   Pharmaceutical  research  and  development
spending  increased 13% over the prior year, and as a percentage
of  pharmaceutical sales, was 12.5% in the third quarter of 1999
and 12.6% in the third quarter of 1998.

In research and development highlights this quarter, the Company
and  Otsuka  Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., announced a  development,
commercialization and collaboration agreement for  aripiprazole,
a  novel drug under study in Phase III trials as a treatment for
schizophrenia.  This  new compound has  a  unique  mechanism  of
action  and  has the potential to expand the options for  safely
and  effectively  treating schizophrenia  and,  possibly,  other
forms  of  mental illness. In October, the U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration  (FDA) approved the use of TAXOL*  injection  for
adjuvant   treatment  of  node-positive   breast   cancer.    In
September,  the  Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  recommended
that  the  FDA  approve  UFT(r) capsules  in  combination   with
leucovorin   calcium   tablets  for  treatment   of   metastatic
colorectal  cancer. Also in September, ZERIT*  and  VIDEX*  were
both approved by the FDA for use as a first-line component of  a
combination  antiretroviral  therapy  regimen  for  HIV-infected
patients.

The  Company also submitted a regulatory application to the  FDA
in   September  to  gain  marketing  approval  for  a  new  oral
antidiabetic combination drug.  The new drug, which is the first
fixed  combination product of its kind to be  developed  in  the
United  States, leverages the benefits of two widely  prescribed
oral  antidiabetic  medications,  GLUCOPHAGE(r) (metformin)  and
glyburide,  a  well  established  sulfonylurea  antidiabetic.  A
regulatory  application was filed with the FDA in  September  to
gain  marketing  approval for VANIQA*, a topical  treatment  for
excessive facial hair in women.

                             -11-
<PAGE>

The  Company  is awaiting marketing approval from  the  FDA  for
TEQUIN*  (gatifloxacin), a broad-spectrum  quinolone  antibiotic
for the treatment of multiple common infections, including those
of  the  respiratory tract. The Company also plans to  file  for
regulatory  approval with the FDA for a new  hypertension  drug,
VANLEV*,  by  the  end  of  the year with  worldwide  regulatory
filings to follow.  A research agreement between the Company and
Exelixis  Pharmaceuticals  was recently  announced  to  identify
novel, validated targets for new medicines using the genetics of
yeast, worms and fruit flies.


Earnings
- --------

Earnings  before  income taxes increased 13% to  $1,518  million
from  $1,346 million in 1998. The effective tax rate on earnings
before  income  taxes decreased to 27.7% in 1999 from  28.2%  in
1998. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due to increased
earnings   from  lower  tax  rate  jurisdictions.  Net  earnings
increased 14% to $1,097 million from $966 million in 1998. Basic
earnings  per share increased 12% to $.55 from $.49 in 1998  and
diluted  earnings per share increased 15% to $.54 from  $.47  in
1998.


Nine Months Results of Operations
- ---------------------------------

Worldwide sales for the first nine months of 1999 increased  11%
over  the prior year to $14,814 million.  The consolidated sales
growth  resulted  from a 9% increase due  to  volume  and  a  2%
increase due to changes in selling prices.  Foreign exchange had
no  effect  on sales for the nine months.  U.S. sales  increased
16%  and  international sales increased  3%  (4%  excluding  the
effect of foreign exchange).

Sales  in the medicines products segment increased 14% over  the
prior  year to $10,413 million. Sales growth for the nine months
resulted from a 13% increase in volume, a 2% increase in selling
prices   and  a  1%  decrease  due  to  foreign  exchange   rate
fluctuations.  Worldwide pharmaceutical sales increased 15% with
U.S. pharmaceutical sales up 23% over the prior year.

Cardiovascular drug sales of $2,673 million increased  15%  from
the  prior  year. PRAVACHOL* increased 5% to $1,252 million  and
MONOPRIL* increased 10% to $316 million. PLAVIX(r) had  sales of
$364 million for the nine months and AVAPRO(r) had sales of $176
million.   Sales growth for these products was partially  offset
by  a  22% decline in CAPOTEN* sales, due to the loss of  patent
exclusivity  in  international markets.   Sales  of  anti-cancer
drugs  increased  21% to $2,585 million due to strong  sales  of
TAXOL* and OTN which increased 24% to $1,067 million and 41%  to
$656 million, respectively.  Anti-infective drug sales increased
4%  to $1,819 million as ZERIT* and VIDEX* recorded gains of 17%
to   $458   million  and  26%  to  $148  million,  respectively.
International  sales of MAXIPIME* increased 26% to  $92  million
for  the nine months and sales of CEFZIL* increased 11% to  $329
million.  Sales of central nervous system drugs increased 13% to
$888  million  as  BUSPAR* and SERZONE* increased  14%  to  $418
million  and  19% to  $233 million, respectively.  GLUCOPHAGE(r)
continued  its strong growth and increased 53% to $980  million.
Analgesic  sales of $540 million increased 6% primarily  due  to
increases in EFFERALGAN* of 9% to $118 million and BUFFERIN*  of
14%  to  $97 million.  Sales of EXCEDRIN* decreased 1%  to  $173
million,  coming off significant increases in 1998  due  to  the
launch of EXCEDRIN MIGRAINE*.

Earnings  before  taxes  for  the  medicines  products   segment
increased  17%  to $2,943 million in 1999.  As a  percentage  of
sales, earnings before taxes for this segment improved to  28.3%
in  1999  from 27.5% in 1998.  Advertising and promotion,  sales
force  and  general  administrative  expenses  improved,  as   a
percentage of sales, partially offset by an increase in cost  of
goods sold, as a percentage of sales.

Sales  in  the  beauty care products segment  increased  5%  (6%
excluding  the  effect of foreign exchange) to  $1,822  million.
Sales  growth  resulted  from a 4%  increase  in  volume,  a  2%
increase  in  selling prices and a 1% decrease  due  to  foreign
exchange  rate  fluctuations.  HERBAL  ESSENCES*  continued  its
strong  growth, increasing 16% to $486 million.  HERBAL ESSENCES
FACIAL  CARE*  contributed  $15 million  in  nine  month  sales.
AUSSIE*  products contributed $93 million, an increase  of  15%,
and sales of DAILY DEFENSE* increased 60% to $93 million for the
nine  months.  Earnings before taxes for the beauty care segment
decreased  to  $202 million in 1999 from $257 million  in  1998,
primarily  due  to  the  introduction  of  a  demand  management
manufacturing system.

Sales in the nutritional products segment increased 3% to $1,354
million  (4%  excluding the effect of foreign exchange).   Sales
growth  for  the  nine months resulted from  a  4%  increase  in
volume,  and  a  1%  decrease  due  to  foreign  exchange   rate
fluctuations. Changes in selling prices had no effect  on  sales
for  the nine months. Total infant formula sales of $896 million
were  at  prior  year levels.  ENFAMIL* recorded sales  of  $525
million,  a  4% increase over the prior year. BOOST*,  an  adult
nutritional  supplement, increased 29%  to  $84  million.   Nine
month sales of VIACTIV* were $19 million.  Earnings before taxes
for  the nutritional products segment were $268 million in  1999
compared to $260 million in 1998 and, as a percentage of  sales,
earnings  before  taxes  were  19.8%  in  both  1999  and  1998.
Increases,  as  a percentage of sales, in cost of products  sold
and advertising and promotion expenses were offset by decreases,
as  a  percentage  of  sales, in sales  force  and  general  and
administrative expenses.

Medical  device  segment sales increased 4% to  $1,225  million,
excluding  sales  from a 1998 distribution  agreement  with  the
acquirer  of Zimmer's divested arthroscopy and powered  surgical
instrument  business.   On  this  basis,  medical  device  sales
increased  3% due to volume and 1% due to foreign exchange  with
no  effect  from price changes. Zimmer sales on the  same  basis
increased  7%  to  $704 million.  Knee joint  replacement  sales
increased  11%  to  $277  million  and  hip  replacement   sales
increased  9% to $209 million. ConvaTec remained at  prior  year
levels of $521 million as sales of ostomy products decreased  2%
to  $324  million and wound care products increased 1%  to  $173
million.   Earnings before taxes for the medical devices segment
increased 11% to $253 million in 1999 from $227 million in  1998
and,  as  a percentage of sales, improved to 20.7% in 1999  from
18.8%  in  1998, resulting from a decrease, as a  percentage  of
sales, in cost of products sold.

Operating Expenses
- ------------------

Total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 1999,  as
a  percentage of sales, decreased to 70.9% from 71.6%  in  1998.
Cost of products sold increased to 27.5% of sales from 26.5%  in
1998  primarily  due  to revenue growth  of  OTN  which  carries
significantly  lower margins. Excluding OTN,  cost  of  products
sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 24.3% in 1999  from
24.0%  in 1998 due to decreased sales of CAPOTEN*.  Expenditures
for  advertising  and promotion in support of new  and  existing
products  remained  at  prior year  levels  of  $1,768  million.
Marketing, selling, administrative and other expenses  increased
7%  to $3,338 million from $3,116 million in 1998. Research  and
development  expenditures increased 14% to $1,328  million  from
$1,165  million in 1998. Pharmaceutical research and development
spending  increased 14% over the prior year, and as a percentage
of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.4% compared to 12.6% in the same
period of 1998.


Earnings
- --------

Earnings  before income taxes for the nine months increased  13%
to $4,312 million from $3,802 million in 1998. The effective tax
rate  on earnings before income taxes decreased to 27.8% in 1999
from 28.2% in 1998. Net earnings increased 14% to $3,115 million
from  $2,728 million in 1998. Basic earnings per share increased
15%  to $1.57 from $1.37 in 1998 and diluted earnings per  share
increased 15% to $1.54 from $1.34 in 1998.


Financial Position
- ------------------

The  balance  sheet at September 30, 1999 and the  statement  of
cash  flows for the nine months then ended reflect the Company's
strong financial position.  The Company continues to maintain  a
high  level  of working capital, increasing to $3.6  billion  at
September 30, 1999, from $3.0 billion at December 31, 1998.

Long-Term  Debt decreased to $1,331 million from $1,364  million
at December 1998.

Internally generated funds continue to be the Company's  primary
source  for  financing expenditures for new plant and equipment.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities increased 7% to $2,852
million in 1999.  Additions to fixed assets for the nine  months
ended  September  30, 1999 were $455 million  compared  to  $537
million during the same period of 1998.

During  the  nine months ended September 30, 1999,  the  Company
purchased 15.2 million shares of its common stock.

The  Company  is  exposed to market risk, including  changes  in
currency  exchange  rates. To reduce these  risks,  the  Company
enters  into  certain  derivative  financial  instruments  where
available  on  a  cost-effective basis to hedge  its  underlying
economic  exposure.  These instruments also  are  managed  on  a
consolidated  basis to efficiently net exposures and  thus  take
advantage of any natural offsets.

                             -14-
<PAGE>

It  is the Company's policy to hedge certain underlying economic
exposures to reduce foreign exchange risk.  Derivative financial
instruments are not used for trading purposes.  Gains and losses
on  hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses  on  the
underlying  exposures  being hedged.   Foreign  exchange  option
contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts are used to
hedge anticipated transactions.

During the first quarter of 1998, the Company divested its  BANr
brand  of  anti-perspirants  and deodorants  for  $165  million,
resulting  in a gain of $125 million before taxes.   During  the
second  quarter,  the Company divested A/S GEA, a  Denmark-based
generic   drug   business,  and  Hexachimie,  a  fine   chemical
manufacturer  based in France, resulting in a combined  gain  of
$76  million before taxes.  The Company recorded provisions  for
restructuring  of $201 million before taxes in  the  first  nine
months of 1998.

Included  in earnings before taxes of each segment is a  cost  of
capital  charge.   The offset to the cost of  capital  charge  is
included  in  Other. In addition, Other principally  consists  of
interest   income,   interest  expense,  certain   administrative
expenses  and  allocations to the industry segments  for  certain
corporate  programs.  For the first nine months  of  1998,  Other
also includes the gain on sale of businesses of $201 million  and
a  provision for restructuring of $201 million.  In addition, the
segment  information  reflects  certain  internal  organizational
changes  made  in  1999.  Prior  year  data  have  been  restated
accordingly.


Year 2000
- ---------

The  Company  has  reviewed its information, manufacturing,  and
research and development systems for Year 2000 compliance.   The
Year  2000 problem arises because many computer systems use only
two  digits  to  represent the year.   These  programs  may  not
process  dates  beyond 1999, which may cause miscalculations  or
system failures.

The  Company  has  completed a comprehensive compliance  program
used  to assess the Year 2000 problem in the processing of  data
in the Company's information technology (IT) and non-IT systems,
including  manufacturing, and research and development  systems.
This  program  was  executed  in  five  phases  which  included:
Assessment, Planning, Execution, Testing and Certification,  and
Implementation.

In connection with this compliance program, the Company also has
asked   critically  important  vendors,  customers,   suppliers,
governmental  regulatory authorities and financial institutions,
whose incomplete or untimely resolution of the Year 2000 problem
could  potentially have a significant impact  on  the  Company's
operations, to assess their Year 2000 readiness. This assessment
has  been  completed.  The follow-up phase of this  work  (which
includes ongoing monitoring of Year 2000 readiness of the  third
parties and developing contingency plans relating to those third
parties whose responses raise issues or who did not respond)  is
being  undertaken  by  the business continuity  and  contingency
planning committees referred to below.

Contingency  plans  are  in  place to minimize  any  significant
exposures  from the failures of third parties to  be  Year  2000
compliant.   The  contingency plans include  backup  procedures,
identification   of  alternate  suppliers,  and   increases   in
inventory  levels where appropriate.  The contingency plans  are
complete and will continue to be tested during the rest  of  the
year.   In  addition, the Company has formed  business  steering
committees to monitor contingency planning activities at various
business-unit and corporate levels. These committees proactively
monitor  critical  internal systems  as  well  as  the  external
environment.   The  Company  has set up  procedures  to  receive
relevant information regarding any Year 2000 related events from
all of the markets during the year-end change.  This information
will  be  collected by these committees, who will  initiate  the
implementation  of  contingency plans in  a  timely  manner,  as
necessary.

                             -16-
<PAGE>

As a result of the comprehensive compliance program, information
received from critically important third parties regarding their
Year 2000 readiness, and  the  contingency  plans in place,  the
Company  does not expect the Year 2000 problem, as well  as  the
cost of the compliance program, to have a material impact on the
Company's  results  of operations, financial condition  or  cash
flows.   However, there can be no assurance that  third  parties
will  convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that
is compatible with the Company's systems.


Reference  is  made  to Part II, Item 1 - Legal  Proceedings  in
which  developments are described for various  lawsuits,  claims
and proceedings in which the Company is involved.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
- ---------------------------


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Various  lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature  considered
normal  to  its  business  are pending against  the  Company  and
certain  of its subsidiaries.  The most significant of these  are
reported  in  the Company's Annual Report on Form  10-K  for  the
fiscal  year ended December 31, 1998 and any subsequent  material
developments in such matters are described below.


Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-
K  for  the  fiscal  year ended December 31, 1998,  the  Company,
together  with  its  subsidiary, Medical Engineering  Corporation
(MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant
in  a number of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal
injuries of various types resulting from breast implants formerly
manufactured by MEC or a related company.

Of  the  more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against  the
Company  in  direct  lawsuits  or  through  registration  in  the
national class action Revised Settlement Program, most have  been
dealt with through the Revised Settlement, other settlements,  or
trial.  Since December 31, 1998, the Company has settled, reached
agreements  to settle, or otherwise disposed of large numbers  of
claims  of  persons  with breast implants made  by  MEC.   As  of
November  1, 1999, the Company's contingent liability in  respect
of  breast implant claims was limited to residual unpaid  Revised
Settlement Program obligations and to roughly 2,200 remaining opt-
outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court.

As of November 1, 1999, approximately 7,400 United States and 200
foreign  breast  implant recipients were plaintiffs  in  lawsuits
pending in federal and state courts in the United States  and  in
certain  courts  in Canada and Australia.  These figures  include
the claims of plaintiffs that are in the process of being settled
and/or dismissed.  In these lawsuits, about 4,200 U.S. plaintiffs
and  50  foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised  Settlement.
The  lawsuits of approximately 3,200 U.S. plaintiffs who did  not
opt  out  are  expected to be dismissed as these  plaintiffs  are
among  the estimated 74,000 women with MEC implants who chose  to
participate  in the nationwide settlement.  Of the 4,200  opt-out
plaintiffs, an estimated 2,000 plaintiffs have claims based  upon
products that were not manufactured and sold by MEC or that  have
been  or  are  in the process of being settled and/or  dismissed.
Accordingly, the number of remaining plaintiffs who have  pursued
or  may  pursue  their  claims in court against  the  Company  is
roughly 2,200 as stated in the preceding paragraph.

Under the terms of the Revised Settlement Program, additional opt-
outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for U.S. class
members  to  opt  out  has  passed.  In addition,  the  Company's
remaining  obligations under the Revised Settlement  Program  are
limited because most payments to "Current Claimants" have already
been  made,  no additional "Current Claims" may be filed  without
court  approval,  and  because payments of  claims  to  so-called
"Other  Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are  limited  by  the
terms of the Revised Settlement Program.  The Company believes it
will  be  able  to address remaining opt-out claims  as  well  as
remaining obligations under the Revised Settlement Program within
its  reserves as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.


                             -18-

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

The  Company  remains a defendant in several actions  challenging
pricing  on brand name prescription drugs.  These actions include
several  currently consolidated antitrust actions brought against
the   Company   and   more   than  thirty  other   pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers  by
certain  chain  drugstores, supermarket  chains  and  independent
drugstores;  state  pharmaceutical actions; and  purported  class
actions  on  behalf of consumers.  The Company will  continue  to
defend  vigorously  its position in this ongoing  litigation  and
believes  it will be able to address all remaining claims  within
its  reserves as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.


Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

As previously reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-
K  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998, the Company,  one
of  its subsidiaries, and others have been defendants in a number
of  antitrust  actions  in  various states  filed  on  behalf  of
purported  statewide  classes of indirect  purchasers  of  infant
formula  products  and  by the Attorneys  General  of  Louisiana,
Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and
other  violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade  practice
laws  and  seeking penalties and other relief.  The  Company  has
resolved  all  of these actions except for a purported  statewide
class  action  of indirect purchasers in Louisiana in  which  the
plaintiffs  filed a petition for certiorari in the United  States
Supreme  Court  on  jurisdictional grounds following  the  United
States  Court  of  Appeals' affirmation of the  district  court's
dismissal of such action.

                              THIS AGREEMENT dated as of
               June 1, 1999, is made by and between BRISTOL-
               MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation
               (the "Company"),            (the "Executive").

          WHEREAS the Company considers it essential to the
best interests of its shareholders to foster the continuous
employment of key management personnel;
          WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly
held corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control
(as defined in the last Section hereof) exists and that such
possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may
raise among management, may result in the departure or
distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the
Company and its shareholders; and
          WHEREAS the Board has determined that appropriate
steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the
continued attention and dedication of members of the
Company's management, including the Executive, to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the
possibility of a Change in Control.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and the mutual covenants herein contained, the Company and
the Executive hereby agree as follows:

                         ARTICLE I
                       Defined Terms
          The definition of capitalized terms used in this
Agreement is provided in the last Article hereof.

                         ARTICLE II
                     Term of Agreement
          This Agreement shall commence on the date hereof
and shall continue in effect through December 31, 2002;
provided, however, that commencing on January 1, 2003 and
each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement shall
automatically be extended for one additional year unless the
Company or the Executive shall have given at least 30 days'
prior notice not to extend this Agreement or a Change in
Control shall have occurred prior to such January 1;
provided, however, if a Change in Control shall have
occurred during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall continue in effect for a period of not less than
36 months beyond the month in which such Change in Control
occurred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Article, this Agreement shall terminate upon the Executive's
attaining his Retirement Date.

                        ARTICLE III
               Company's Covenants Summarized
          In order to induce the Executive to remain in the
employ of the Company and in consideration of the
Executive's covenants set forth in Section 4 hereof, the
Company agrees, under the conditions described herein, to
pay the Executive the "Severance Payments" described in
Section 6.01 hereof and the other payments and benefits
described herein in the event the Executive's employment
with the Company is terminated following a Change in Control
and during the term of this Agreement.  No amount or benefit
shall be payable under this Agreement unless there shall
have been (or, under the terms hereof, there shall be deemed
to have been) a termination of the Executive's employment
with the Company following a Change in Control.  This
Agreement shall not be construed as creating an express or
implied contract of employment and, except as otherwise
agreed in writing between the Executive and the Company, the
Executive shall not have any right to be retained in the
employ of the Company.

                         ARTICLE IV
                 The Executive's Covenants
          The Executive agrees that, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, in the event of a
Potential Change in Control during the term of this
Agreement, the Executive will remain in the employ of the
Company until the earliest of (i) a date which is six months
from the date of such Potential Change of Control, (ii) the
date of a Change in Control, (iii) the date of termination
by the Executive of the Executive's employment for Good
Reason (determined by treating the Potential Change in
Control as a Change in Control in applying the definition of
Good Reason) or by reason of death or (iv) the termination
by the Company of the Executive's employment for any reason.

                         ARTICLE V
         Compensation other than Severance Payments
          SECTION 5.01.  Following a Change in Control and
during the term of this Agreement, during any period that
the Executive fails to perform the Executive's full-time
duties with the Company as a result of Disability, the
Executive shall be compensated as provided pursuant to the
terms of the Company's short- and long-term disability plans
as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control
together with all other compensation and benefits payable to
the Executive pursuant to the terms of any compensation or
benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by the
Company during such period.
          SECTION 5.02.  If the Executive's employment shall
be terminated for any reason following a Change in Control
and during the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay
the Executive's full salary to the Executive through the
Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time the
Notice of Termination is given, together with all other
compensation and benefits payable to the Executive through
the Date of Termination (including, without limitation, all
incentive compensation amounts owed the Executive for a
completed calendar year to the extent not yet then paid)
under the terms of any compensation or benefit plan, program
or arrangement maintained by the Company during such period.
          SECTION 5.03.  If the Executive's employment shall
be terminated for any reason following a Change in Control
and during the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay
the Executive such normal post-termination compensation and
benefits to the Executive as may be provided by the
Company's retirement, insurance and other compensation or
benefit plans, programs and arrangements, as in effect
immediately prior to a Change in Control.

                         ARTICLE VI
                     Severance Payments
          SECTION 6.01.  In lieu of any other severance
compensation or benefits to which the Executive may
otherwise be entitled under any plan, program, policy or
arrangement of the Company (and which the Executive hereby
expressly waives), the Company shall pay the Executive the
payments described in this Section 6.01 (the "Severance
Payments") upon the termination of the Executive's
employment following a Change in Control and during the term
of this Agreement in addition to the payments and benefits
described in Article V hereof, unless such termination is
(i) by the Company for Cause, (ii) by reason of death, or
(iii) by the Executive without Good Reason.  The Executive's
employment shall be deemed to have been terminated following
a Change in Control by the Company without Cause or by the
Executive with Good Reason if the Executive's employment is
terminated prior to a Change in Control without Cause at the
direction of a Person who has entered into an agreement with
the Company the consummation of which will constitute a
Change in Control or if the Executive terminates his
employment with Good Reason prior to a Change in Control
(determined by treating a Potential Change in Control as a
Change in Control in applying the definition of Good Reason)
if the circumstance or event which constitutes Good Reason
occurs at the direction of such Person.
          (a)  In lieu of any further salary payments to the
Executive for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination
and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to
the Executive, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump
sum severance payment, in cash, equal to three or, if less,
the number of years, including fractions, from the Date of
Termination until the Executive reaches his Retirement Date,
times the sum of (i) the higher of the Executive's annual
base salary in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of
the event or circumstance upon which the Notice of
Termination is based or in effect immediately prior to the
Change in Control, and (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Executive's target annual bonus entitlement under the
Incentive Plan (or any other bonus plan of the Company then
in effect) as in effect immediately prior to the occurrence
of the circumstances giving rise to the Notice of
Termination given in respect thereof (provided that if it is
not practicable to determine the amount that the Executive's
aggregate target bonus would have been for the year in which
the Notice of Termination was given, then, for purposes of
this paragraph (a), the Executive's target annual bonus
entitlement shall be the amount of the largest aggregate
annual bonus paid to him with respect to the five years
immediately prior to the year in which the Notice of
Termination was given).
          (b)  Notwithstanding any provision of the
Incentive Plan or any other compensation or incentive plans
of the Company, the Company shall pay to the Executive a
lump sum amount, in cash, equal to the sum of (i) any
incentive compensation which has been allocated or awarded
to the Executive for a completed calendar year or other
measuring period preceding the Date of Termination but has
not yet been paid (pursuant to Section 5.02 hereof or
otherwise), and (ii) a pro rata portion to the Date of
Termination of the aggregate value of all contingent
incentive compensation awards to the Executive for the
current calendar year or other measuring period under the
Incentive Plan, the Award Plan or any other compensation or
incentive plans of the Company, calculated as to each such
award on a basis which assumes that at least 100% of any
performance target or goal was achieved, and otherwise on a
basis on which the Executive will receive a pro rata portion
(based on elapsed time) of the amounts he would have been
entitled to receive if he had continued to be employed by
the Company throughout the period contemplated with respect
to such award and if all other conditions for receiving the
maximum amount with respect to all such awards had been met.


                          E-10Q-3
<PAGE>

           (c)  All outstanding Options shall become
immediately vested and exercisable (to the extent not then
vested and exercisable).  To the extent not otherwise
provided under the written agreement evidencing the grant of
any restricted Shares to the Executive, all outstanding
Shares which have been granted to the Executive subject to
restrictions which, as of the Date of Termination, have not
then lapsed shall lapse automatically upon the Date of
Termination and the Executive shall own such Shares free and
clear of all such restrictions.
          (d)  In addition to the retirement benefits to
which the Executive is entitled under the Retirement Plan
and BEP, or any successor plans thereto, the Company shall
pay the Executive an additional amount equal to the excess
of (x) the retirement pension (determined as a straight life
annuity commencing at Retirement Date) which the Executive
would have accrued under the terms of the Retirement Plan
and BEP (without regard to any amendment to the Retirement
Plan or BEP made subsequent to a Change in Control and on or
prior to the Date of Termination, which amendment adversely
affects in any manner the computation of retirement benefits
thereunder), determined as if the Executive (i) were fully
vested thereunder, and (ii) had accumulated (after the Date
of Termination) 36 additional months of age and service
credit thereunder at the Executive's highest annual rate of
compensation during the 12 months immediately preceding the
Date of Termination (but in no event shall the Executive be
deemed to have accumulated additional service credit in
excess of that provided pursuant to the Retirement Plan and
BEP) and (y) the retirement pension (determined as a
straight life annuity commencing at the Executive's
Retirement Date) which the Executive had then accrued
pursuant to the respective provisions of the Retirement Plan
and BEP, such additional amount to be paid, except as
provided in the last sentence of this Section 6.01(d), at
such time or times as the relevant benefits are payable to
the Executive under the Retirement Plan and BEP,
respectively, or any successor plans thereto; provided,
however, that if the transaction constituting the Change in
Control has not been approved by the Board prior to the
consummation thereof, the actuarial equivalent of such
additional benefits under this Section 6.01(d) shall be paid
in a cash lump sum.  If the Executive has not attained
age 55 with ten years of service credit as of the Date of
Termination, the Executive may nevertheless elect to receive
(x) his vested benefit (after giving effect to the 36 months
of additional age and service credit provided in the first
sentence of this Section 6.01(d)) under the BEP
(notwithstanding any provision of the BEP to the contrary)
and (y) the incremental vested benefit which would be
accrued under the Retirement Plan (after giving effect to
the 36 months of additional age and service credit provided
in the first sentence of this Section 6.01(d)) over the
Executive's actual accrued benefit thereunder (without
giving effect to such additional credit), such amounts under
clauses (x) and (y) to be paid under the BEP either (i) in
an annuity (in the form provided under the BEP) commencing


                          E-10Q-4
<PAGE>

immediately following the Date of Termination, or (ii) in a
lump sum payment, the amount of which in either case shall
be the actuarial equivalent of the vested annual benefit
payable to the Executive assuming that the Executive had
attained age 55 with ten years of service credit as of the
Date of Termination (i.e., without actuarial reduction to
reflect the fact that the Executive has not attained age 55
with ten years of service as of the Date of Termination).
For purposes of this Section 6.01(d), "actuarial equivalent"
shall be determined using the same methods and assumptions
utilized under the Retirement Plan immediately prior to the
Date of Termination.
          (e)  For a 36-month period after the Date of
Termination, the Company shall arrange to provide the
Executive with life and health (including medical and
dental) insurance benefits and perquisites substantially
similar to those which the Executive is receiving
immediately prior to the Notice of Termination (without
giving effect to any reduction in such benefits subsequent
to a Change in Control).  Benefits and perquisites otherwise
receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Section 6.01(e)
shall be reduced to the extent comparable benefits are
actually received by or made available to the Executive
without greater cost to him than as provided by the Company
during the 36-month period following the Executive's
termination of employment (and any such benefits actually
received by the Executive shall be reported to the Company
by the Executive).
          (f) Following the 36-month period described in the
first sentence of Section 6.01(e), the Executive shall be
immediately eligible to participate (although the Executive
may elect to defer commencement of such participation to
such later date as the Executive shall determine) in the
Company's retiree medical and dental plans, whether or not
the Executive has satisfied any age and service requirements
then applicable.  For purposes of determining the level of
the Executive's participation thereunder, the Executive
shall be deemed to have accumulated 36 months of additional
age and service credit; it being understood that if the
Executive's age and service credit (as augmented hereunder)
do not satisfy the minimum requirements for eligibility, the
Executive shall be eligible to participate at the level
requiring the maximum contribution requirement by an
eligible retiree.
          (g)  In addition to the vested amounts, if any, to
which the Executive is entitled under the Savings Plan as of
the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay the Executive
a lump sum amount equal to the value of the unvested
portion, if any, of the employer matching contributions
credited to the Executive under the Savings Plan.
          (h)  The Company shall provide the Executive with
reasonable outplacement services consistent with past
practices of the Company prior to the Change in Control.
          SECTION 6.02.  Subject to the immediately
following paragraph of this Section 6.02, in the event that
the Executive becomes entitled to the Severance Payments, if
any of the Severance Payments or any other portion of the
Total Payments (as defined below) will be subject to the
Excise Tax, the Company shall pay to the Executive an
additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net
amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any
Excise Tax on the Severance Payments and such other Total
Payments and any Federal, state and local income tax (taking
into account the loss of itemized deductions) and employment
tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this

                         E-10Q-5
<PAGE>

Section 6.02, shall be equal to the present value of the
Severance Payments and such other Total Payments.  For
purposes of determining whether any of the Severance
Payments or other Total Payments will be subject to the
Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) any other
payments or benefits received or to be received by the
Executive in connection with a Change in Control or the
Executive's termination of employment, whether pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement
or agreement with the Company, any Person whose actions
result in a change in control or any Person affiliated with
the Company or such Person (together with the Severance
Payments, the "Total Payments"), shall be treated as
"parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(l) of the
Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless,
in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company's
independent auditors and reasonably acceptable to the
Executive (the "Tax Counsel"), such other payments or
benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute
payments, including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of
the Code, or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in
part) represent reasonable compensation for services
actually rendered, within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the Base
Amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, or are
otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, (ii) the amount of
the Severance Payments which shall be treated as subject to
the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the total
amount of the Severance Payments and other Total Payments or
(B) the amount of excess parachute payments within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(l) of the Code (after applying
clause (i), above), and (iii) the value of any noncash
benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be
determined by the Company's independent auditors in
accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and
(4) of the Code.  For purposes of determining the amount of
the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay
Federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of Federal
income taxation (taking into account the loss of itemized
deductions) in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up
Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at
the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and
locality of the Executive's residence on the Date of
Termination, net of the maximum reduction in Federal income
taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state
and local taxes.  In the event that the Excise Tax is
subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken
into account hereunder at the time of termination of the
Executive's employment, the Executive shall repay to the
Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in
Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-
Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion
of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and
Federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up
Payment being repaid by the Executive to the extent that
such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a
Federal, state or local income tax deduction) plus interest
on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code.  In the event that the
Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into
account hereunder at the time of the termination of the
Executive's employment (including by reason of any payment
the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the
time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an
additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus
any interest, penalties or additions payable by the
Executive with respect to such excess) at the time that the
amount of such excess is finally determined.  The Executive
and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the
other in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability
for Excise Tax with respect to the Severance Payments and
other Total Payments.

                          E-10Q-6
<PAGE>

          Notwithstanding the provisions of the first
paragraph of this Section 6.02, (i) the Company shall have
no obligation to make the Gross-Up Payment unless the value
of the Total Payments for purposes of Section 280G of the
Code (and the regulations thereunder) equals or exceeds 110%
of the maximum amount of parachute payments which could be
paid to the Executive without any imposition of golden
parachute excise taxes under Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Code (the "110% Amount"), and (ii) if (x) any portion of the
Total Payments would be subject to the imposition of golden
parachute excise taxes under Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Code and (y) the value of the Total Payments is less than
the 110% Amount, then, to the extent necessary to make such
portion of the Total Payments not subject to such golden
parachute excise taxes (and after taking into account any
reduction in the Total Payments provided by reason of
Section 280G of the Code in any other plan, arrangement or
agreement), (A) the cash Severance Payments shall first be
reduced (if necessary, to zero), and (B) all other non-cash
Severance Payments shall next be reduced (if necessary, to
zero).  For purposes of the limitation described in
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, (i) no portion of the
Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the
Executive shall have effectively waived in writing prior to
the Date of Termination shall be taken into account, (ii) no
portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account
which, in the opinion of the Tax Counsel, does not
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, including by reason of
section 280(b)(4)(A) of the Code, (iii) the Severance
Payments shall be reduced only to the extent necessary so
that the Total Payments (other than those referred to in
clauses (i) or (ii) of this sentence) in their entirety
constitute reasonable compensation for services actually
rendered within the meaning of section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the
Code or are otherwise not subject to disallowance as
deductions, in the opinion of the Tax Counsel; and (iv) the
value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or
benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined
by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the
principles of sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.
          If it is established pursuant to a final
determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service
proceeding that, notwithstanding the good faith of the
Executive and the Company in applying the terms of the
limitation described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of
the preceding paragraph of this Section 6.02, the aggregate
"parachute payments" paid to or for the Executive's benefit
are in an amount that would result in any portion of such
"parachute payments" not being deductible by reason of
section 280G of the Code, then the Executive shall have an
obligation to pay the Company upon demand an amount equal to
the sum of (i) the excess of the aggregate "parachute
payments" paid to or for the Executive's benefit over the
aggregate "parachute payments" that could have been paid to
or for the Executive's benefit without any portion of such
"parachute payments" not being deductible by reason of
section 280G of the Code; and (ii) interest on the amount
set forth in clause (i) of this sentence at the rate
provided in section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code from the date
of the Executive's receipt of such excess until the date of
such payment.

                        E-10Q-7
<PAGE>

          SECTION 6.03.  The payments provided for in
Section 6.01 (other than Section 6.01(e)) and 6.02 hereof
shall be made not later than the fifth day following the
Date of Termination; provided, however, that if the amounts
of such payments cannot be finally determined on or before
such day, the Company shall pay to the Executive on such day
an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Company, of
the minimum amount of such payments to which the Executive
is clearly entitled and shall pay the remainder of such
payments (together with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount
thereof can be determined but in no event later than the
30th day after the Date of Termination.  In the event that
the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount
subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall
constitute a loan by the Company to the Executive, payable
on the fifth business day after demand by the Company
(together with interest at the rate provided in
Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).  At the time that
payments are made under this Section, the Company shall
provide the Executive with a written statement setting forth
the manner in which such payments were calculated and the
basis for such calculations including, without limitation,
any opinions or other advice the Company has received from
outside counsel, auditors or consultants (and any such
opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to
the statement).
          SECTION 6.04.  The Company also shall pay to the
Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by the
Executive as a result of a termination which entitles the
Executive to the Severance Payments (including all such fees
and expenses, if any, incurred in disputing any such
termination or in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce
any benefit or right provided by this Agreement or in
connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent
attributable to the application of Section 4999 of the Code
to any payment or benefit provided hereunder and including,
but not limited to, auditors' fees incurred in connection
therewith).  Such payments shall be made within five
business days after delivery of the Executive's written
requests for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees
and expenses incurred as the Company reasonably may require.


                        ARTICLE VII

                 Termination Procedures and
                Compensation During Dispute

          SECTION 7.01.  Notice of Termination.  After a
Change in Control and during the term of this Agreement, any
purported termination of the Executive's employment (other
than by reason of death) shall be communicated by written
Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other
party hereto in accordance with Article X hereof.  For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" shall
mean a notice which shall indicate the specific termination
provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth
in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to
provide a basis for termination of the Executive's
employment under the provision so indicated.  Further, a
Notice of Termination for Cause is required to include a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-quarters (3/4) of the entire membership
of the Board at a meeting of the Board which was called and
held for the purpose of considering such termination (after
reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for
the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel, to be
heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion
of the Board, the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in
clause (i) or (ii) of the definition of Cause herein, and
specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
          SECTION 7.02.  Date of Termination.  "Date of
Termination", with respect to any purported termination of
the Executive's employment after a Change in Control and
during the term of this Agreement, shall mean (i) if the
Executive's employment is terminated for Disability, thirty
(30) days after Notice of Termination is given (provided
that the Executive shall not have returned to the full-time
performance of the Executive's duties during such 30 day
period), and (ii) if the Executive's employment is
terminated for any other reason, the date specified in the
Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination
by the Company, shall not be less than 30 days (except in

          SECTION 7.03.  Dispute Concerning Termination.  If
within 15 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or,
if later, prior to the Date of Termination (as determined
without regard to this Section 7.03), the party receiving
such Notice of Termination notifies the other party that a
dispute exists concerning the termination, the Date of
Termination shall be the date on which the dispute
is finally resolved, either by mutual written agreement of
the parties or by a final judgment, order or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or
with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has
expired and no appeal has been perfected); provided further,
that the Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice
of dispute only if such notice is given in good faith and
the party giving such notice pursues the resolution of such
dispute with reasonable diligence.
          SECTION 7.04.  Compensation During Dispute.  If a
purported termination occurs following a Change in Control
and during the term of this Agreement, and such termination
is disputed in accordance with Section 7.03 hereof, the
Company shall continue to pay the Executive the full
compensation in effect when the notice giving rise to the
dispute was given (including, but not limited to, salary)
or, if greater, the full compensation in effect immediately
prior to the Change in Control, and continue the Executive
as a participant (on a basis at least as favorable to the
Executive as in effect immediately prior to the Change in
Control) in all compensation, benefit and insurance plans in
which the Executive was participating when the notice giving
rise to the dispute was given, until the dispute is

finally resolved in accordance with Section 7.03 hereof.
Amounts paid under this Section 7.04 are in addition to all
other amounts due under this Agreement (other than those due
under Section 5.02 hereof) and shall not be offset against
or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.

                        ARTICLE VIII
                       No Mitigation
          The Company agrees that, if the Executive's
employment by the Company is terminated during the term of
this Agreement, the Executive is not required to seek other
employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts
payable to the Executive by the Company pursuant to Section
6 or Section 7.04.  Further, the amount of any payment or
benefit provided for in Article VI (other than
Section 6.01(e)) or Section 7.04 shall not be reduced by any
compensation earned by the Executive as the result of
employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by
offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the
Executive to the Company, or otherwise.

                         ARTICLE IX
                       Noncompetition
          In consideration for the payments and benefits
provided by the Company under this Agreement, the Executive
shall execute, concurrent with the execution of this
Agreement, a noncompetition agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A, which agreement provides that, for a
one-year period following the Executive termination of
employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates, the Executive shall not engage in any
competitive activity with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates.

                         ARTICLE X
               Successors; Binding Agreement
          SECTION 10.01.  In addition to any obligations
imposed by law upon any successor to the Company, the
Company will require any successor (whether direct or
indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise)
to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of
the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this
Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Company would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place.  Failure of the Company to
obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the
effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of
this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to
compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the
same terms as the Executive would be entitled to hereunder
if the Executive were to terminate the Executive's
employment for Good Reason after a Change in Control, except
that, for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date
on which any such succession becomes effective shall be
deemed the Date of Termination.
          SECTION 10.02.  This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or
legal representatives, executors, administrators,
successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If
the Executive shall die while any amount would still be
payable to the Executive hereunder (other than amounts
which, by their terms, terminate upon the death of the
Executive) if the Executive had continued to live, all such
amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the
executors, personal representatives or administrators of the
Executive's estate.

                         ARTICLE XI
                          Notices
          For the purpose of this Agreement, notices and all
other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be
in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when
delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the
respective addresses set forth below, or to such other
address as either party may have furnished to the other in
writing in accordance herewith, except that notice of change
of address shall be effective only upon actual receipt:

                        ARTICLE XII
                       Miscellaneous
          No provision of this Agreement may be modified,
waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or
discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the
Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated
by the Board.  No waiver by either party hereto at any time
of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance
with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be
performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of
similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same
or at any prior or subsequent time.  No agreements or
representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with
respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by
either party which are not expressly set forth in this
Agreement.  The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws
of the State of New York.  All references to sections of the
Exchange Act or the Code shall be deemed also to refer to
any successor provisions to such sections.  Any payments
provided for hereunder shall be paid net of any applicable
withholding required under Federal, state or local law and
any additional withholding to which the Executive has
agreed.  The obligations of the Company and the Executive
under Articles VI and VII shall survive the expiration of
the term of this Agreement.

                        ARTICLE XIII
                      Validity/Pooling
          The invalidity or unenforceability or any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect.  If (i) the
Board approves a merger or consolidation of the Company
which is intended by the Board to satisfy the accounting
rules related to the pooling of interest method of
accounting (the "Pooling Rules") and (ii) any provision of
this Agreement would violate the Pooling Rules, then such
provision shall be null and void ab initio.  In such event,
the Company and Executive shall negotiate, in good faith, a
replacement provision of equivalent value which does not
cause such a violation, provided, and to the extent, that
the Company's outside auditors determine that any such
replacement provision is permissible without violating the
Pooling Rules.

                        ARTICLE XIV
                        Counterparts
          This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which together will constitute one and
the same instrument.

                         ARTICLE XV
            Settlement of Disputes; Arbitration
          All claims by the Executive for benefits under
this Agreement shall be directed to and determined by the
Board and shall be in writing.  Any denial by the Board of a
claim for benefits under this Agreement shall be delivered
to the Executive in writing and shall set forth the specific
reasons for the denial and the specific provisions of this
Agreement relied upon.  The Board shall afford a reasonable
opportunity to the Executive for a review of the decision
denying a claim and shall further allow the Executive to
appeal to the Board a decision of the Board within 60 days
after notification by the Board that the Executive's claim
has been denied.  Any further dispute or controversy arising
under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled
exclusively by arbitration in New York, New York in
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
Association then in effect.  Judgment may be entered on the
arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction;
provided, however, that the Executive shall be entitled to
seek specific performance of the Executive's right to be
paid until the Date of Termination during the pendency of
any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection
with this Agreement.

     or any substitute plans adopted prior to the Change in
     Control, unless an equitable arrangement (embodied in
     an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been
     made with respect to such plan, or the failure by the
     Company to continue the Executive's participation
     therein (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on
     a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of

          The Executive's right to terminate the Executive's
employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the
Executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness.
The Executive's continued employment shall not constitute
consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any act
or failure to act constituting Good Reason hereunder.

an event that would otherwise constitute Good Reason
hereunder shall cease to be an event constituting Good
Reason if Notice of Termination is not timely provided to

Bristol-Myers  Squibb Company has offered  me  an  Executive
Severance Agreement.

In consideration of the above-referenced Executive Severance
Agreement, I agree as follows:

1.   For a one-year period commencing upon my termination, I
     will not in any way, directly or indirectly, own, manage,
     operate, control, accept employment or a consulting position
     with or otherwise advise or assist or be actively connected
     with,  or  have any financial interest in, directly  or
     indirectly, any enterprise which engages in, or otherwise
     carries on, any business activity in competition with the
     businesses  of  Bristol-Myers Squibb  Company  and  its
     subsidiaries and affiliates (referred to collectively as the
     "Company"), in any geographic area in which it engages in
     such business (including,  without limitation, the United
     States and each county in the State of California in which
     the Company from time to time sells or offers its products
     for sale), without the prior written consent of the Company.
     I recognize that the Company's business is worldwide in
     scope in that it directly advertises and solicits business
     from customers wherever they may be found.  It is understood
     that ownership of not more than one percent (1%) of the
     equity securities of a public company shall in no way be
     prohibited pursuant to the foregoing provisions.  I further
     agree that I shall not take any action which might divert
     from the Company or any of its successors or assigns any
     opportunity which would be within the scope of its or their
     respective present or future operations or business.  I
     understand  that  this paragraph  supersedes  the  Non-
     competition provision set forth in my Restricted Stock Award
     Agreement, however in no way modifies the other provisions
     of that agreement which remain in full force and effect.

2.   For a one-year period commencing upon my termination, I
     will not in any way, directly or indirectly, employ, solicit
     for employment, or advise or recommend to any other person
     that  they employ or solicit for employment, any person
     employed at the time by the Company.

3.   I  hereby  waive any and all rights to sue the  Company
     and  its  past, present and future officers, directors,
     employees and agents (referred to collectively  as  the
     "Released Parties") based upon any act or event occurring
     prior to my signing this Agreement.  Without limitation, I
     specifically release the Released Parties from any and all
     claims arising out of my employment and separation from the
     Company, including claims based on discrimination under
     federal anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII of the
     Civil Rights Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, The
     Americans with Disabilities Act, claims for interference

Agreement and Release


     with  my  rights to benefits under section 510  of  the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act and any and all
     federal, state and local laws.

     However, I am not giving up my right to appeal a denial
     of  a claim for benefits submitted under my medical  or
     dental  coverage,  life insurance or disability  income
     program maintained by the Company.  Further, I  am  not
     giving  up  my right to file for unemployment insurance
     benefits at the appropriate time if I so choose, and my
     signing  of this release will not affect my rights,  if
     any,  to  coverage by Workers' Compensation  insurance.
     Nothing herein shall affect any benefits to which I  am
     entitled  under  the  terms of the Executive  Severance
     Agreement  or any claim arising out of the  enforcement
     of the Executive Severance Agreement.

4.   I  acknowledge that I have been given at least  twenty-
     one (21) days to consider and sign this release.  I further
     acknowledge that it will not be effective for a period of
     seven (7) days, during which time I can change my mind and
     revoke my signature.  To revoke my signature, I must notify
     the Company in writing, within seven days of the date I
     signed  this  release.  In the event that I  revoke  my
     signature  I  will not be entitled to the consideration
     described above.

Finally,   I  acknowledge  the  continuing  nature   of   my
obligation to maintain in confidence and not to make use  of
confidential  information concerning the Company's  business
or  affairs of any nature that is not otherwise a matter  of
public   record.   This  obligation  continues   after   the
termination of my employment.

MY  SIGNATURE BELOW ACKNOWLEDGES THAT I HAVE READ THE ABOVE,
UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SIGNING, AND AM ACTING OF MY  OWN  FREE
WILL.   I UNDERSTAND THAT IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT
IS  FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, IT WILL NOT AFFECT
THE  VALIDITY  OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION.   I
FURTHER  AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED  BY  THE
LAWS  OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  THE COMPANY HAS ADVISED  ME
TO  CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY, AND I HAVE DONE SO,  PRIOR  TO
SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT.
