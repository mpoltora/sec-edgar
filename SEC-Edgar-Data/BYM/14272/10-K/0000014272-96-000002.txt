Item 1.   BUSINESS.

DESCRIPTION OF BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
- -------------------------------------------

General:
- -------
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("Bristol-Myers Squibb" or the "Company") was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under
the name Bristol-Myers Company as successor to a New York business started
in 1887. In 1989, the Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company, as a result of a merger.  The Company, through its
divisions and subsidiaries, is a major producer and distributor of
pharmaceutical products, medical devices, nonprescription health products,
toiletries and beauty aids.  In general, the business of the Company's
industry segments is not seasonal.

Toiletries and Beauty Aids:
- --------------------------
This segment includes sales of haircoloring and hair care preparations,
which comprise about 75% of the segment's sales in 1995 and 1994 and 65%

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
- -----------------------------------------
Bristol-Myers Squibb, for the most part, purchases the principal raw
materials and supplies used in each industry segment in the open market.
Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so
that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
- --------------------------------
The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United
States and foreign countries covering products, principally in the
pharmaceutical products and medical devices segments, and has also
developed many brand names and trademarks for products in each industry
segment.  Reference is made to Industry Segments in the Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
Item 7 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.  The Company considers the overall
protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of material
value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.  The Company
believes that, except for the U.S. patent relating to captopril whose
expiration date was redefined by legislation implementing the GATT treaty
to February 1996, no single patent or license is of material importance in
relation to the business as a whole.

COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
- ---------------------------------------
The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad
based, heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal
means of competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers
Squibb include quality, service, price and product performance.  The
products of the pharmaceutical products segment and the medical devices
segment are promoted on a national and international basis in medical
journals and directly to the medical profession.  Most of the other
products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised and promoted on a
national and international basis through the use of television, radio,
print media, consumer offers, and window and in-store displays.  Bristol-Myers
Squibb's products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail
trade both nationally and internationally.  Certain products of the
pharmaceutical products and medical devices segments are also sold to other
drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None of the
segments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such that
the loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the
segment.

                                       3

<PAGE>

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------
Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's
businesses, particularly to the pharmaceutical products segment.
Management continues to place great emphasis on these activities.
Pharmaceutical research and development is carried out by the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute which has major
facilities in Princeton and New Brunswick, New Jersey, Wallingford,
Connecticut and Seattle, Washington.  Pharmaceutical research and
development is also carried out at various other facilities in the
United States and in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the
United Kingdom.

Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,199 million in 1995, $1,108 million in
1994 and $1,128 million in 1993 on company sponsored research and
development activities.  Pharmaceutical research and development
spending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.9% in 1995
compared to 13.6% in 1994 and 14.9% in 1993.

REGULATION
- ----------
Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of
government regulation in the countries in which its operations are
conducted.  The Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory
requirements applying to its products and operations.  For some
products, and in some countries, government regulation is significant
and, in general, there is a trend to more stringent regulation.  The
Company devotes significant time, effort and expense addressing the
extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its
business.  Governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or
seizure of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary
for the production or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal
sanctions.

In the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and
cosmetic industries in which the Company operates have long been subject
to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.
Assuring compliance with appropriate laws and regulations requires
increasing expenditures of time and resources.

In addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other
countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care
and, in some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and
on appropriate drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas
already exists in some countries and may be expanded significantly in
the United States and other countries in the future.

While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business
may be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its
substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements
and restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its
development of new and improved products should enable it to compete
effectively within this environment.

EMPLOYEES
- ---------
Bristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 49,140 people at December 31, 1995.

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
- -------------------------------
Reference is made to Note 16 Segment Information in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this
Form 10-K Annual Report.

International operations are subject to certain risks which are inherent
in conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or
expropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on foreign
participation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental
actions.  In addition, changes in the relative value of currencies take
place from time to time and their effects may be favorable or
unfavorable on Bristol-Myers Squibb's operations.  There are currency
restrictions relating to repatriation of earnings in certain countries.

Item 2.   PROPERTIES.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's world headquarters is located at 345 Park Avenue,
New York, New York, where it leases approximately 841,800 square feet of
floor space, approximately 285,880 square feet of which is sublet to
others.  The Company's pharmaceutical world headquarters is located in
Princeton, New Jersey.  Other major domestic pharmaceutical facilities
are located in Evansville, Indiana, New Brunswick and Plainsboro, New
Jersey and Buffalo and Syracuse, New York.  The Company's major domestic
medical devices facilities are located in Warsaw, Indiana, St. Louis,
Missouri, Skillman, New Jersey and Greensboro, North Carolina.

Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures products at forty-eight major
worldwide locations with an aggregate floor space of approximately
13,278,000 square feet.  Forty-six are owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb and
two facilities are leased.  The U.S. manufacturing facilities total
eighteen, of which 44% and 28% are used in the manufacture of
pharmaceutical products and medical devices, respectively.  The non-U.S.
operations include a total of thirty  major manufacturing facilities, of
which 73% and 3% are used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products
and medical devices, respectively.  These facilities are located in
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Ireland,
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, South
Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Venezuela, and aggregate
approximately 6,539,800 square feet of space.

Portions of these facilities and other facilities owned or leased by
Bristol-Myers Squibb in the United States and elsewhere are used for
research, administration, storage and distribution.  Bristol-Myers
Squibb's facilities are well-maintained, adequately insured and in
satisfactory condition.

Capital expenditures for the construction, expansion and modernization
of production, research and administrative facilities aggregated $517
million, $577 million and $580 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------
As of December 31, 1995, approximately 20,000 plaintiffs had filed suit
against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
("MEC"), and certain other companies, in federal and state courts and in
certain Canadian provincial courts, alleging damages for personal
injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane covered breast
implants and smooth walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC
or its predecessors. Most of these plaintiffs are participants in the
1994 class action settlement referred to below.  A number of other
manufacturers of breast implants, as well as suppliers of component
parts and other parties, are also defendants in many of these cases.
The plaintiffs typically seek compensatory damages for alleged medical
conditions and emotional distress as well as punitive damages.  Some of
these women have sued numerous manufacturers without specifying the
manufacturer of the implants involved.

In June 1992, all federal breast implant cases were consolidated for
pre-trial purposes in the Northern District of Alabama before the
Honorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr.  On September 1, 1994, Judge Pointer
approved a class action settlement, subject to various conditions,
involving payments totaling up to approximately $4.25 billion by the
defendants over 30 years.  The Court excluded claimants from Quebec,
Ontario and Australia from the settlement but allowed voluntary
participation by such women.  Appeals of the Court's order approving the
settlement were filed, primarily by health insurers, health care
organizations and foreign claimants.  These appeals are still pending.

The settlement permitted claimants to elect not to participate (opt out)
and, as stated below, over 9,000 foreign and domestic women (as to all
defendants) had elected to opt out of the settlement.  The settlement
also provided, among other things, that if the total dollar value of all
approved current disease compensation claims, as defined in the
settlement agreement, exceeded $1.2 billion, scheduled benefits would be
reduced and claimants would have a second opportunity to withdraw or opt
out of the settlement.  On October 7, 1995, after reviewing a sample of
about 3,000 claims, Judge Pointer issued an order declaring that class
members in the breast implant class action settlement would be accorded
such a second opt out right because the value of current claims would
likely far exceed the $1.2 billion set aside for such claims.

Under the October 7 order, class members would be permitted to opt out
and pursue litigation beginning on or about December 1, 1995.  The Court
stated, however, that class members would not be required to take
immediate action to file suit to preserve their claims, for the class
action would be maintained and statutes of limitations would remain
suspended until a class member opts out (subject to any cut-off dates).
The Court also then indicated that a revised settlement program might be
offered by the Company, Baxter Healthcare and 3M Company.

On November 13, 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized
management to enter into such a revised settlement program.  Baxter
Healthcare, 3M Company, McGhan Medical Corporation and Union Carbide
Corporation also agreed to participate.  On December 22, 1995, Judge
Pointer approved the revised settlement.  New appeals have been filed
from the order approving the revised settlement.

                                       6
<PAGE>
The fifteen-year revised settlement program generally provides benefits
to those breast implant recipients, other than foreign claimants, who
have had at least one breast implant manufactured by one of the settling
defendants (or their predecessors or subsidiaries).  Several kinds of
benefits are available for eligible participants with breast implants
made by companies affiliated with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter and 3M:
(1) for current claimants, compensation ranging from $10,000 to $50,000
based on disease and disability definitions of the original settlement,
plus supplemental benefits of an additional $15,000 to $50,000 for
claimants with ruptured implants; (2) for current claimants seeking
higher benefits and for other registrants, compensation ranging from
$75,000 to $250,000 based on new, more stringent disease and disability
definitions; and (3) although the settling defendants are not
recommending removal of implants absent some specific medical reason, a
$3,000 payment for those class members (other than late registrants) who
seek removal of implants.  In addition, current claimants would be
eligible for an advance payment of $5,000, and other existing
registrants would be eligible for an advance payment of $1,000.  For
certain current claimants, benefits would be payable regardless of the
number of claimants seeking compensation, regardless of the total dollar
value of approved claims, and, in many cases, regardless of the outcome
of appeals from the order approving the settlement.  For other
claimants, benefits would be subject to annual limits aggregating $755
million for all participating companies over the fifteen-year life of
the program.  The Company's aggregate limit for such benefits over that
period is $400 million.  In the event the dollar value of claims subject
to the limit exceeds the annual amount, affected claimants may be
afforded a new opt out right but without the right to assert punitive or
other statutory multiple damage claims.

In January 1996, the settlement notice was mailed to approximately
450,000 persons.  In addition to explaining potential class members'
rights and benefits under the settlement, the notice packet also
provides instructions for class members who may wish to opt out of the
settlement.  Although class members are now permitted to opt out of the
settlement, the Court has cautioned class members against doing so and
has "strongly recommend[ed]" that most class members delay any decision
about opting out until they receive a Notification of Status letter from
the claims office.  Class members must then decide whether to
participate in the settlement or opt out no later than 45 days after
they receive the Notification of Status letter.  Class members who had
not previously registered by certain deadlines will have the opportunity
to opt out provided they register by April 1, 1996.  At this time, it is
not possible on any reliable basis to estimate with any precision how
many class members will participate in or opt out of the settlement.

The cost of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying
factors, including the number of class members that participate in the
settlement, the kinds of claims approved and their dollar value.  In
light of the uncertainties attendant to these and other factors, it is
not possible to achieve any precision at this time in estimating the
cost of the settlement to the Company.  The Court has advised that
approximately 440,000 women with implants of all manufacturer companies
had registered with the claims office under the original settlement,
including approximately 57,000 foreign class members.  However, since
all women with implants were urged by the Court to register, the number
of registrants does not indicate the number of women who have filed or
will file claims against the settlement funds.

                                       7

<PAGE>

In July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million (U.S. funds)
class action settlement with plaintiff representatives in the provinces
of Ontario and Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had MEC
breast implants and who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received
their MEC implants there.  The settlement has been approved by the
provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.  The Company has the right to
withdraw from the settlement if the number of persons participating in
the settlement is unacceptably low.

The Company's insurers have been notified of the breast implant claims,
the settlement and revised settlement, and generally have reserved their
rights or declined to confirm coverage.  In 1993, the Company commenced
litigation in state court, Jefferson County, Texas, against most of the
Company's insurers, seeking damages and a declaration of coverage.  The
Company has reached settlements with some of its insurers and trial of
this insurance coverage case currently is expected in late 1996.

As of December 1, 1995, 7,115 United States women and 2,140 foreign
women (excluding those from Australia, Ontario and Quebec) had elected
to opt out of the original settlement as to all defendants.  With
respect to such opt outs by women from the United States, and after
accounting for settlements and other case dispositions since that time,
the Company now estimates that approximately 2,600 women, a large number
of whom reside in Texas, may have remaining claims based upon MEC
implants.  The Company has, at this time, identified approximately 300
of the foreign opt outs as having MEC implants.  A number of the opt
outs cannot, at this time, be identified as having implants of any
particular manufacturer, although it is expected that such manufacturer
identification will ultimately be possible in most cases.  In addition,
as indicated above, it is not possible at this time to estimate the
number of women who will opt out of the revised settlement so that the
exact number of lawsuits that will remain outstanding against the
Company with respect to breast implant litigation cannot be determined
at this time.

The cost to the Company of resolving opt out claims is subject to a
number of complex uncertainties in addition to the unknown quantity and
quality of such claims.  While there have been some large judgments, the
relatively few trials against breast implant manufacturers have produced
mixed results and additional trials may affect the outlook.  The Company
expects to try a number of breast implant cases in various states in
1996.  It has maintained throughout this litigation that breast implants
do not cause disease and recent medical and scientific data support the
Company's position.  The results of continuing medical research and a
variety of additional factors, including the success of other legal
defenses and the success of the revised settlement program, may
substantially affect the cost of resolving opt out cases.

In 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500 million before
taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant product
liability claims.  The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential
liabilities and expenses, offset by $1 billion of expected insurance
proceeds.  In 1994, the Company recorded an additional special charge of
$750 million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) in respect of
breast implant product liability claims.  In the fourth quarter of 1995,
the Company recorded an additional special charge in respect of such
claims.  The 1995 charge consisted of $950 million before taxes, $590
million after taxes, or $1.17 per share.  Since so much information

                                       8

<PAGE>

about these claims is not yet known, predictions about the existence or
amount of any future charges cannot be definitely made at this time; it
can only be said that an additional charge may be required as additional
information relating to the revised settlement and the litigation
becomes known and that, while any such charge could have a material
adverse effect on the results of operations in the period in which
taken, the Company does not believe that such a charge would have a
material adverse effect on its liquidity or its consolidated financial
position.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------
The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are defendants in a
number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of
purported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula
products and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and
Mississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations of
state antitrust or deceptive trade practices laws and seeking damages
and/or penalties and other relief.  On December 6, 1995, a trial in
state court in Wichita, Kansas in which the Company and Abbott
Laboratories were defendants concluded with a jury verdict in favor of
the defendants.  This case in Kansas was the first infant formula
indirect purchaser case to go to trial.  The court subsequently denied
the plaintiff's motion for a new trial.  Courts in Colorado, Florida,
Kentucky, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee have dismissed similar
complaints, and the plaintiffs have appealed or are expected to appeal
those dismissals.  On June 29, 1995, the Texas Supreme Court handed down
a decision in the Company's favor, holding that the plaintiffs, as
indirect purchasers, were barred from proceeding under the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act.  The Company
subsequently settled a separate action brought by the Texas Attorney
General.  Motions to certify classes of indirect purchasers of infant
formula have been denied in Minnesota, in Michigan and by two courts in
Alabama, and have been granted in Wisconsin and South Dakota.  A trial
date of June 10, 1996 has been set in the Wisconsin case.  The Canadian
Bureau of Competition Policy has discontinued its inquiries into alleged
anticompetitive practices by the Company and certain other members of
the Canadian infant formula industry.  The Competition Law Enforcement
Authority in France, the Conseil de la Concurrence, has brought a
complaint against seven infant formula companies (including
Bristol-Myers Squibb SA) and five food outlet chains alleging violations
by manufacturers in obtaining infant milk rotations from hospitals and
against both manufacturers and retailers for allegedly engaging in
resale price maintenance of infant formula.  The Company is in the
process of responding to these allegations.  The Company believes that
these actions are without merit and that their ultimate disposition will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Pharmaceutical Pricing Litigation
- ---------------------------------
As of December 31, 1995, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains
and independent drugstores, suing either individually or as a
representative of a nationwide class of retail pharmacies that has been
certified.  These cases, which have been coordinated for pretrial
purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District

                                       9

<PAGE>

of Illinois, all seek treble damages and injunctive relief on account of
an alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning the pricing and marketing of
brand name prescription drugs; the plaintiffs who are suing individually
are also asserting claims of unlawful price discrimination under the
Robinson-Patman Act.  Discovery has been completed with respect to
claims concerning the alleged antitrust conspiracy.  Completion of
additional discovery with respect to Robinson-Patman Act claims against
the Company has been stayed.  None of the plaintiffs has specified the
amount of damages claimed, but plaintiffs in the class action have
indicated that they intend to claim damages, before trebling, ranging
from 5% to approximately 20% of the value of their purchases of brand
name prescription drugs from defendants since October 15, 1989.  It is
estimated that the class members who have not opted out represent
approximately two-thirds of retail pharmacy purchases of brand name
prescription drugs during the alleged damages period.  As of January 31,
1996, the Company, without admitting any wrongdoing, reached an
agreement, which is subject to approval by the Court, to settle the
class action for payments by the Company over three years totaling $33.9
million.  The settlement involved twelve other defendants as well and
was preliminarily approved by the Court on February 15, 1996.  A hearing
concerning final approval is scheduled for March 27, 1996.  Federal
cases brought by retail pharmacies that have opted out of the class
remain pending, and the Company has moved for summary judgment with
respect to the conspiracy claims asserted in those actions.  Class
action cases brought by retail pharmacies in state courts against a
similar group of defendants and alleging similar grounds under state law
are proceeding in California, Alabama, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  The
California court has certified a class of California retail pharmacies.
Class action cases brought by consumers in state courts against a
similar group of defendants and alleging similar grounds under state law
have been brought in California, Washington, Colorado, New York,
Arizona, Maine, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, the District of Columbia
and Wisconsin.   The California court has certified a class of
California consumers.  The Alabama court has purported to certify a
class consisting of consumers in Alabama and other states, including the
District of Columbia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
New Mexico and Wisconsin.  The consumer actions brought in Washington
and Colorado have been dismissed; an appeal is pending in the Washington
action.  The Company believes that these actions are without merit and
that their ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or consolidated
financial position.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------
The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved
in, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection
Agency or comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or
Superfund) or comparable state laws directed at the cleanup of hazardous
waste sites.  While it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of these cases, the Company believes that the ultimate
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's operating results, liquidity or consolidated financial
position.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SUMMARY
- -------
In 1995, Bristol-Myers Squibb achieved record sales, with all four of
the Company's segments reporting sales increases.  Sales increased 15%
over the prior year to $13.8 billion.  Domestic sales increased 10% to
$7.7 billion, while international sales increased 22% to $6.1 billion.
Exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable effect of 1% on worldwide
sales and 3% on international sales.

Earnings before income taxes, excluding the 1995 and 1994 special
charges and the 1995 provision for restructuring, increased 11% to
$3,662 million in 1995, as net earnings increased 12% to $2,600 million
and earnings per share increased 12% to $5.14 from $4.58 in 1994.
Including these charges, earnings before income taxes were $2,402
million in 1995 and $2,555 million in 1994, net earnings were $1,812
million in 1995 and $1,842 million in 1994, and earnings per share were
$3.58 in 1995 and $3.62 in 1994.

During the past two years, the Company has broadened and enhanced its
product lines with a number of strategic acquisitions and
collaborations.  In 1994, the Company acquired the remaining interest in
the UPSA Group, the leading maker and marketer of analgesics in France
and Belgium, acquired Matrix Essentials, Inc., the leading manufacturer
in North America of professional hair care products for beauty salons,
and acquired an equity interest in Azupharma GmbH, one of Germany's
major generic pharmaceutical companies.  In 1995, the Company acquired
Calgon Vestal Laboratories, a wound and skin care and infection control
products business, and A/S GEA Farmaceutisk Fabrik, a leading
manufacturer and marketer of branded generic pharmaceuticals for the
Scandinavian market.  During 1995, the Company announced research
alliances and biotechnology collaborations, which are described later in
the research and development discussion.  In January 1996, the Company
acquired control of Pharmavit Gyogyszer-es Elelmiszeripari Reszvenytarsasag,
one of Hungary's leading manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines,
nutritional products and generic pharmaceuticals.

In addition to its strong product lines, the Company continues to
benefit from its strong financial position.  At December 31, 1995, the
Company held $2.2 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable
securities.  Cash provided by operating activities, which totaled $2.5
billion in 1995, continued as the primary source of financing Company
growth, research, new product development and introductions, capital
spending and working capital needs.  It also was used to pay dividends
of nearly $1.5 billion in 1995.  Dividends per common share were $2.96
in 1995, increasing from $2.92 per share paid in 1994.  An additional
dividend increase was announced in December 1995.  The 1996 indicated
annual payment of $3.00 per share represents the twenty-fourth
consecutive year that the Company has raised the dividend on its common
stock.  With this 1996 annual payment, Bristol-Myers Squibb dividends
will have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the
past 10 years.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's strong financial position is
evidenced by its triple A credit rating from both Moody's and Standard &
Poor's, making Bristol-Myers Squibb one of only nine U.S. companies with
this distinction.  The Company as a result, has substantial unused
borrowing capacity by which it can pursue its objectives.

NET SALES AND EARNINGS
- ----------------------
Worldwide sales increased 15% in 1995 to $13.8 billion, compared to
increases of 5% and 2% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Volume growth
was the primary contributor to the increase in sales in 1995, with price
increases having minimal impact.  Price increases and the favorable
effect of exchange rate fluctuations each contributed 1% to sales growth
on a worldwide basis.  Price increases had no impact on domestic sales
growth in 1995.  In 1994, the 5% increase in sales reflected a 4%
increase due to volume and a 1% increase due to price increases.
Exchange rate fluctuations had no attributable effect on total Company
sales growth.  Domestic sales increased 10% in 1995 and 4% in both 1994
and 1993, while international sales increased 22% in 1995, 7% in 1994
and remained at prior year levels in 1993.

As described in Notes 2 and 17 to the financial statements, the Company
previously reported its agreement to settle pending and future breast
implant product liability claims (related to a previously discontinued
business of a subsidiary) brought against it, its Medical Engineering
Corporation subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries.  In the fourth
quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a special charge to earnings of
$950 million before taxes, $590 million after taxes, or $1.17 per share.
The 1995 special charge is in addition to a charge of $750 million
before taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.96 per share, recorded in
the fourth quarter of 1994 and a charge of $500 million before taxes
($1.5 billion of liability offset by expected insurance proceeds of $1.0
billion), $310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share, recorded in the
fourth quarter of 1993.

During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded a provision for
restructuring of $310 million before taxes, $198 million after taxes, or
$.39 per share.  The provision primarily relates to the consolidation of
plants and facilities, and related employee termination costs.

As a result of the special charges and the provision for restructuring,
net earnings were $1,812 million, or $3.58 per share, in 1995, $1,842
million, or $3.62 per share, in 1994 and $1,959 million, or $3.80 per
share, in 1993.  Excluding the special charges and the 1995 provision
for restructuring, net earnings were $2,600 million, or $5.14 per share,
in 1995, $2,330 million, or $4.58 per share, in 1994 and $2,269 million,
or $4.40 per share, in 1993.

The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 24.6%
in 1995 compared with 27.9% and 23.8% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Excluding the special charges and the provision for restructuring, the
effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 29.0% in
1995, 29.5% in 1994 and 26.1% in 1993.  The 1995 effective income tax
rate, a decrease of 0.5% from 1994, resulted from higher levels of
income from lower tax jurisdictions.  The increase in the 1994 effective
income tax rate to 29.5% from 26.1% in 1993 resulted from the
curtailment of certain tax benefits from Puerto Rico operations, enacted
in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

EXPENSES
- --------
Total costs and expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the special
charges and the provision for restructuring, were 73.4% in 1995,
compared with 72.4% in 1994 and 73.1% in 1993.  The increase in 1995
primarily resulted from increased advertising and promotion expenditures
in the nonprescription health products and toiletries and beauty aids
segments.  In addition, due to the Company's increased participation in
the federal government's Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program,
gross margins in the nonprescription health products segment were lower
than the prior year.  The decrease in 1994 primarily resulted from
reductions in selling expenses, improvements in gross margin and the
divestiture of businesses with higher costs.

Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased to 26.4% in
1995 from 26.1% in 1994.  The increase in 1995 is due to increased
participation in the WIC program and lower gross margins in connection
with recent acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by a
favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies.  In 1994,
cost of products sold decreased as a percentage of sales from 26.5% in
1993 to 26.1% due to a favorable product mix and the divestiture of
businesses with higher cost of sales.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of
sales, were 26.7% in 1995 compared to 26.4% in 1994 and 27.1% in 1993.

Advertising and promotion expenses in support of new and existing
products increased to $1,646 million in 1995 from $1,367 million in
1994, primarily due to spending in support of new product launches.  In
1994, advertising and promotion expenses increased from 1993 levels
primarily as a result of increases in the toiletries and beauty aids
segment, with the addition of Matrix Essentials, Inc., and in the
pharmaceutical products segment, in preparation for the launches of new
products.

The Company's investment in research and development totaled $1,199
million in 1995, an increase of 8% over 1994.  The higher level of
spending reflects the Company's continued commitment to research over a
broad range of therapeutic areas and to clinical development in support
of new products.  Over the last 10 years, research and development
expenses increased at a compound annual rate of 11%.  In 1995, research
and development spending dedicated to the discovery and development of
pharmaceutical products was 12.9% of pharmaceutical sales compared to
13.6% and 14.9% in 1994 and 1993, respectively.  During 1995, the
Company announced research alliances and biotechnology collaborations
with the following companies: SEQ LTD, for ultra-high speed DNA
sequencing; Genzyme Transgenics, for the production of antibodies from
goats' milk; Phyton, Inc., for an option to license plant cell culture
for the production of TAXOL(R)*(paclitaxel); and Spec/Biospecs, for
access to its libraries of novel organic chemicals.  The Company entered
into a licensing arrangement with Taiho of Japan to develop and market
UFT (tegafur and uracil), an oral anti-tumor agent which may have fewer
debilitating side effects than current therapy.  The Company made equity
investments in the following companies: Somatix Therapy Corporation, a
company specializing in gene therapy; SIBIA, Inc., a company developing
products based on cloned receptor and functional assay technology for
Alzheimer's disease treatment; IXSYS, Inc., a company engaged in the
development of tumor antigens and antibodies; and EntreMed, Inc., a

                                      20

<PAGE>

leader in the field of angiogenesis research.  During 1995, an
additional equity investment was made in Cadus Pharmaceutical
Corporation, a company that specializes in developing novel drug
screening techniques.  In January 1996, the Company announced a
collaboration with NeuroSearch A/S of Denmark, to develop an oral
compound for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
- -----------------
At the end of 1995, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 29 product lines each with
more than $100 million in annual sales, representing products from all
four of its industry segments.  In general, the business of the
Company's industry segments is not seasonal.

Sales in the Pharmaceutical Products Segment, which represents the
largest segment at 57% of total Company sales, increased 12% in 1995 to
$7,810 million.  Volume growth was the primary contributor to this
increase, as price increases and the favorable effect of exchange rate
fluctuations each had a 1% effect on the segment's sales growth for the
year.  Domestic and international sales increased 7% and 18%,
respectively.  The Company has a strong and growing cardiovascular
product franchise.  Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product
group in the segment at $2.9 billion, increased 6%.  Captopril, an
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the Company's largest
selling product, is primarily sold under the trademark CAPOTEN*.
Captopril sales remained at prior year levels despite increased
competition in the ACE inhibitor market in the U.S. and loss of patent
exclusivity, primarily in Germany.  In the U.S., the expiration date of
the CAPOTEN* patent was redefined by legislation implementing the GATT
treaty to February 1996.  PRAVACHOL*, the Company's largest selling
cholesterol-lowering agent with sales of $770 million, was the largest
contributor to the increase in cardiovascular sales.  In the U.S. and
several other markets, PRAVACHOL* benefited from expanded labeling
describing that it reduces by 67% the risk of recurrent myocardial
infarction in patients with elevated cholesterol.  In the fourth quarter
of 1995, the results were released from the West of Scotland Coronary
Prevention Study, which found that PRAVACHOL* is associated with an
early and sustained reduction of heart attack and death in individuals
with high cholesterol who have never had a heart attack.  MONOPRIL*, a
second generation ACE inhibitor with once-a-day dosage, performed well,
with strong volume growth in the U.S. and in overseas markets.  The
Company also has a strong presence in the anti-infectives market.  Sales
of the Company's anti-infective products increased 12% to $1.7 billion
due to increases in sales of ZERIT*, the Company's newest antiretroviral
drug, cleared for marketing in the U.S. under the FDA's accelerated
approval program in June 1994, and which received full FDA approval in
January 1996, CEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin, used in the treatment of
respiratory infections, DURICEF*, an oral cephalosporin, VIDEX*, an
antiretroviral drug, and broad spectrum penicillins.  In addition,
MAXIPIME*, a fourth generation injectable cephalosporin introduced in
international markets in 1995 and approved for marketing in the U.S. in
early 1996, contributed to the growth of anti-infectives.  Offsetting
these increases were lower sales of AMIKIN* and AZACTAM* due to
increased generic competition.  Bristol-Myers Squibb remains the leader
in the anti-cancer therapeutics category.  Sales of its anti-cancer
drugs increased 20% to $1.6 billion.  Sales of TAXOL* (the exclusivity
for which expires in the U.S. in December 1997), the Company's leading
anti-cancer agent, were $580 million in 1995, increasing 68% over the

                                      21

<PAGE>

prior year.  In April 1994, TAXOL* received clearance in the U.S. for
use in the treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination
chemotherapy for metastatic disease or after relapse within six months
of adjuvant chemotherapy.  In late 1992, TAXOL* was initially cleared in
the U.S. and Canada for treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose
first-line or subsequent chemotherapy has failed.  Also in 1995, 1994
and 1993, TAXOL* received clearance for marketing in a number of
countries in Europe, Latin America and the Pacific area.  Sales of
PARAPLATIN* and PLATINOL* (the patent for which expires in the U.S. in
December 1996), also increased due to their use in combination therapy
with TAXOL*.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in
sales of VEPESID* (the exclusivity for which expired in the U.S. in
November 1993).  The Company has a growing position in the central
nervous system drug category.  Sales of central nervous system drugs
increased 27% primarily due to growth of BUSPAR*, the Company's novel
anti-anxiety agent, STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal spray analgesic,
and sales of SERZONE*, an antidepressant treatment which offers a low
incidence of side effects, launched in the U.S. and other markets in
1995.  In addition, PRODAFALGAN*, from the UPSA Group, also contributed
to the growth of central nervous system drugs.  Dermatological drug
sales increased 9%, largely due to sales of DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3
analog for the treatment of moderate psoriasis.  Increases in sales of
ESTRACE*, a low-dose estrogen replacement therapy, also contributed to
sales growth.  Glucophage, the Company's new oral hypoglycemic agent for
type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes, a product licensed from the
French company Lipha for sale in the U.S., was introduced in 1995 and
performed exceptionally well during its first year on the market.

In 1994, pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 7%, as
increases in sales of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, CAPOTEN*, MONOPRIL*, CEFZIL*
and BUSPAR* were offset in part by decreases in sales of VEPESID*,
CORGARD*, Isovue and AMIKIN*.  In 1993, sales in the segment increased
3%, primarily as a result of increases in PRAVACHOL*, MONOPRIL*,
anti-cancer, anti-infective and central nervous system drug sales which
were partially offset by decreases in CAPOTEN* and CORGARD*.

Operating profit margin, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,
remained relatively constant at 32.7% in 1995, compared to 32.6% in 1994
and 32.7% in 1993.

In the Medical Devices Segment, the Company continued to maintain its
strong leadership positions in the orthopaedic implants, arthroscopy,
powered instruments, ostomy and wound care products markets.  Sales of
$1,906 million reflected a 13% increase over prior year levels.
Excluding Calgon Vestal Laboratories, a wound and skin care and
infection control products business purchased in January 1995, and
Xomed-Treace, Inc., which was divested in April 1994, sales increased
7%, reflecting a 4% increase due to volume and a 3% increase due to the
favorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Price increases had
no effect on sales growth for the year.  Excluding the acquisition,
divestiture and the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, domestic sales
increased 1% and international sales increased 7%.  ConvaTec, a division
of the Company, is the worldwide market share leader in ostomy care
products.  Sales of these products increased 14% over the prior year,
primarily due to volume growth of the ACTIVE LIFE/COLODRESS* and
SURFIT/COMBIHESIVE/SECURE* product lines in the U.S. and international
markets.  Excluding the acquisition of Calgon Vestal Laboratories, sales
of ConvaTec wound care products increased 17%, due to the ongoing

                                      22

<PAGE>

success of the DUODERM* product line.  The Company's Zimmer division is
the world market share leader in knee and hip replacements.  Worldwide
sales of its prosthetic implants increased 3%, led by sales of the
NEXGEN* Complete Knee Solution, introduced in 1995, and the continued
success of the CENTRALIGN* Precoat Hip Prosthesis.  Sales of the
Company's arthroscopy products experienced strong growth, driven by the
APEX* Universal Drive and Irrigation System, introduced in 1995.

In 1994, worldwide sales of medical devices increased 6% as a result of
increased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy and wound care products,
offset in part by volume declines of other product lines divested in
1994 and 1993.  In 1993, sales in the segment increased 2%, primarily
due to increased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy and wound care
products.

Operating profit margin in the medical devices segment, excluding the
1995 provision for restructuring, was 27.0% in 1995, 29.5% in 1994 and
28.1% in 1993.  The 1995 decline resulted from increased research and
development and sales force expenditures.  The increase in 1994 to 29.5%
from 28.1% in 1993 resulted from declines in selling expenses as a
percentage of sales.

Sales in the Nonprescription Health Products Segment, which includes the
Company's worldwide consumer medicines and nutritional products
businesses, increased 22% to $2,495 million.  In September 1994, the
Company acquired the remaining ownership interest of the UPSA Group, the
leading maker and marketer of analgesics in France and Belgium and a
world leader in effervescent technology.  Excluding the acquisition of
the UPSA Group, sales increased 11%, reflecting volume growth.  Price
increases and foreign currency translation had no effect on sales growth
for the year.  Excluding the acquisition and the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations, domestic sales increased 10%, while international sales
increased 15%.  In 1995, the Company's Mead Johnson Nutritional Group
became the U.S. market leader in infant formula.  Volume gains in the
Company's principal infant formulas, the milk-based ENFAMIL* and the
soy-based PROSOBEE*, increased with the addition of new sole-source
contracts, including New York, Florida, Georgia, California and the
Western States Alliance in late 1994 and 1995 under the federal
government's WIC program, as well as strong gains in the non-WIC
segments.  Sales of LACTOFREE*, a milk-based, lactose-free infant
formula, and NUTRAMIGEN* infant formula also increased, as did the
Company's line of SUSTAGEN* products.  BOOST* and SUSTACAL*, two
nutritional beverages launched to consumers in 1995, performed well.
Sales of analgesics increased primarily due to the strong performance of
EXCEDRIN*, the Company's leading analgesic in the U.S., benefiting from
the introduction of EXCEDRIN* Gel Tabs in 1995, strong growth of
BUFFERIN* in Japan and sales of EFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN* and ASPIRINE
UPSA* in Europe.

In 1994, worldwide sales of nonprescription health products increased
4%, due to increased sales of ENFAMIL*, the introductory sales of NEXT
STEP* Toddler Formula, as well as increased sales of EXCEDRIN*,
BUFFERIN* and the addition of products from the UPSA Group.  In 1993,
sales in the segment remained at prior year levels as domestic declines,
primarily in analgesics sales, were offset by international increases,
primarily in sales of BUFFERIN* and ISOCAL* adult nutritional products.

                                      23

<PAGE>

Operating profit margin, excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,
decreased to 18.5% in 1995 compared to 22.3% in 1994, primarily due to
lower margins on infant formula products as a result of increased
participation in the WIC program and increased advertising and marketing
expenses in support of the BOOST* and the SUSTACAL* product launches.
In 1994, operating profit margin decreased to 22.3% from 23.6% in 1993,
partially as a result of higher manufacturing costs.

Sales in the Toiletries and Beauty Aids Segment, where Bristol-Myers
Squibb has strong franchises in haircoloring, hair care and skin care
products, increased 21% in 1995 to $1,556 million.  In August 1994, the
Company acquired Matrix Essentials, Inc., the leading manufacturer in
North America of professional hair care and beauty products sold
exclusively in beauty salons.  Excluding the acquisition of Matrix,
sales increased 10%, reflecting an 8% increase due to volume, a 3%
increase due to pricing and a 1% decrease due to the unfavorable effect
of foreign currency translation.  Excluding the acquisition and foreign
currency translation, domestic sales increased 7%, while international
sales increased 18% over 1994.  The Company's Clairol division continued
to maintain its market share leadership in the U.S. in the haircolorings
product line.  Sales of the Company's haircoloring products were higher,
increasing 10% primarily due to NICE 'N EASY* and the continued success
of NATURAL INSTINCTS*.  Hair care product sales benefited from the
SYSTEME BIOLAGE*, VAVOOM!* and MATRIX ESSENTIALS* lines from Matrix
Essentials, Inc., and from the introduction of the HERBAL ESSENCES*
complete line of shampoos and conditioners.  The Company's skin care
products, primarily the SEA BREEZE* and MATRIX* skin care lines, and the
MUM* line of anti-perspirants and deodorants, also contributed to the
segment's growth.

In 1994, sales in the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 4%,
primarily due to increased sales of haircoloring, hair care and skin
care products, partially offset by decreases in anti-perspirants and
deodorants sales and the 1993 divestiture of the Clairol beauty
appliance business.  In 1993, sales in the segment increased 1%
primarily due to increases in sales of haircoloring and skin care
products.

Operating profit margin in 1995, excluding the 1995 provision for
restructuring, was 10.2% compared to 13.1% in 1994, due to increased
advertising and promotion expenditures related to new product
introductions and established products.  In 1994, the operating profit
margin of 13.1% remained relatively unchanged from the 13.2% reported in
1993.


GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
- ----------------
Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country
in the world; its largest markets are the U.S., France and Japan.

In 1995, sales in the U.S. increased 10%, primarily due to strong growth
from sales of TAXOL*, PRAVACHOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, ENFAMIL*,
PROSOBEE*, LACTOFREE*, EXCEDRIN* and NATURAL INSTINCTS* haircoloring.
Also contributing to sales growth in the U.S., were the successful
product launches of Glucophage, SERZONE*, the NEXGEN* Complete Knee
Solution, BOOST* and the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos and
conditioners, in addition to products from the acquisitions of Matrix

                                      24

<PAGE>

Essentials and Calgon Vestal Laboratories.  Sales in the U.S., excluding
acquisitions, increased 7% compared to 1994.  Excluding the 1995
provision for restructuring, operating profit margin was 27.3% in 1995
compared to 30.1% in 1994.  The decrease in 1995 was the result of lower
gross margins on WIC sales and increased advertising and promotion
expenditures for new product launches.  In 1994, sales in the U.S.
increased 4%, primarily due to strong pharmaceutical sales and sales
from Matrix Essentials, offset in part by volume declines due to the
divestiture of certain businesses in 1993 and early 1994.  Operating
profit margin remained relatively constant at 30.1% in 1994 from 30.0%
in 1993.

In 1995 and 1994, international sales increased 22% and 7%,
respectively. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation,
international sales increased 19% in 1995 and 6% in 1994.

Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 30% due to strong sales
growth of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, ampicillin, amoxicillin, DURICEF*, ostomy
and wound care products and the introductory sales of MAXIPIME*.  Sales
of EFFERALGAN*, DAFALGAN*, and ASPIRINE UPSA*, analgesic products from
the UPSA Group, also contributed to sales growth in the region.
Excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring, operating profit margin
increased 25.6% in 1995 from 21.5% in 1994, primarily as a result of
higher utilization of manufacturing facilities in lower tax
jurisdictions.  In 1994, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased
6%, primarily due to sales from UPSA, increased sales of CAPOTEN* and
MONOPRIL* and introductory sales of TAXOL*.  In 1994, operating profit
margin increased to 21.5% from 19.3% in 1993, primarily due to reduced
operating costs in the pharmaceutical products segment.

Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,
increased 5% in 1995 due to strong sales of TAXOL*, cardiovascular drugs,
SERZONE* and ostomy care products.  These increases were partially offset
by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  Excluding the
1995 provision for restructuring, operating profit margin decreased to
15.2% from 20.5% in 1994 primarily as a result of lower foreign exchange
gains.  In 1994, sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 6%
primarily due to increased sales of anti-infective and cardiovascular
drugs, haircoloring products and the successful launch of TAXOL* in a
number of countries, including Brazil and Argentina.  The 1994 operating
profit margin increased to 20.5% in 1994 from 20.0% in 1993 primarily due
to improvements in the pharmaceutical products segment.

Sales in the Pacific, net of inter-area sales, increased 16% in 1995 as a
result of increased sales of BUFFERIN*, ENFALAC*, ENFAPRO*, SUSTAGEN
JUNIOR*, ALACTA*, anti-infective and cardiovascular drugs, and the SEA
BREEZE* product line.  Excluding the 1995 provision for restructuring,
operating profit margin was 10.8% in 1995 compared to 13.6% in 1994 due
to increased advertising and promotion expenses in support of new product
launches.  In 1994, sales in the Pacific area increased 9%, as a result
of favorable foreign currency translation, increased sales of BUFFERIN*
analgesics, ENFAPRO* follow-on formulas and the launch of SEA BREEZE*
hair care products in Japan.  In 1994, operating profit margin decreased
to 13.6% from 15.8% in 1993, partially due to declines in the medical
devices and nonprescription health products segments.

FINANCIAL POSITION
- ------------------
The Company considers cash, time deposits and marketable securities as
its principal measures of liquidity.  These items totaled $2.2 billion at
December 31, 1995, compared to $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion at December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Working capital was $2.2 billion at
December 31, 1995, compared to $2.4 billion and $3.5 billion at December
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  Working capital decreased in large
measure as a result of product liability costs, acquisitions, dividends
and the Company's continuing share repurchase program.  Cash, time
deposits and marketable securities and the conversion of other working
capital items are expected to be adequate to fund the near-term operating
needs of the Company.

In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company
engages in hedging activities.  The impact of such hedges on the
Company's results of operations and on its financial position is
explained further in Note 11 to the financial statements.

Internally generated cash provided by operations was $2.5 billion in
1995, $2.3 billion in 1994 and $2.6 billion in 1993.  Cash provided by
operations continued to be the Company's primary source of funds used to
finance operating needs, productivity initiatives and expenditures for
new plant and equipment.  As part of the Company's ongoing commitment to
improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities, the
Company has invested over $1.7 billion in capital expansion during the
past three years.  In 1995, the Company opened powder-processing plants
in Zeeland, Michigan, the largest infant formula powder plant in the
world, and in Guangzhou, China.  Cash provided by operations was also
used to pay dividends of nearly $4.5 billion over the past three years
and to fund the $1.4 billion purchase of nearly 24 million shares of the
Company's common stock over the same period.

Note 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------

Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its
subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily
include securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time
of purchase, recorded at cost, which approximates market.

Time Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable
securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value,
which approximates cost.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average
cost, not in excess of market.

Property and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and
betterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally
computed by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful
lives of the related assets.  The range of annual rates used in
computing provisions for depreciation is 2% to 20% for buildings and
5% to 33% for equipment.

Excess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net
tangible assets received in business acquisitions subsequent to
October 31, 1970 is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods not exceeding 40 years.

Earnings Per Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  The
effect of shares issuable under stock plans is not significant.

Note 2  SPECIAL CHARGE
- ----------------------

As described in Note 17, the Company is party to a revised settlement
concerning pending and future breast implant product liability claims
(related to a previously discontinued business of a subsidiary)
brought against it, its Medical Engineering Corporation subsidiary,
and certain other subsidiaries.  In the fourth quarter of 1993, the
Company recorded a special charge of $500 million before taxes, $310
million after taxes, or $.60 per share.  The charge consisted of $1.5
billion in anticipation of its share of the then pending settlement
and cost of the litigation (recorded as Product Liability), offset by
$1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance
Recoverable).  Although the Company is currently engaged in coverage
litigation with certain of its insurers, expected insurance proceeds
represent the amount of insurance which the Company considers
appropriate to record as recoverable at this time.

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        (dollars in millions)

Various events occurred in 1994, including a number of claimants
opting out of the settlement.  Based upon preliminary analyses of the
number of such opt outs and of other issues, in the fourth quarter of
1994 the Company recorded a special charge to earnings of $750 million
before taxes, $488 million after taxes, or $.96 per share.

In the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company, with certain other
defendants, entered into a revised settlement of the breast implant
product liability litigation.  The actual cost to the Company of the
breast implant litigation may be dependant upon a number of factors
which will not become known for some time, including the number of
class members that participate in the revised settlement, the kinds of
claims approved, the dollar value thereof and the disposition of
claims of non-participants.  However, based on current estimates, the
Company has recorded a charge to earnings in respect of breast implant
litigation of $950 million before taxes, $590 million after taxes, or
$1.17 per share.

Note 3  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
- -------------------------------------

In January 1996, the Company acquired control of Pharmavit
Gyogyszer-es Elelmiszeripari Reszvenytarsasag, one of Hungary's
leading manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, nutritional
products and generic pharmaceuticals.

In September 1995, the Company acquired A/S GEA Farmaceutisk Fabrik, a
leading manufacturer and marketer of branded generic pharmaceuticals
for the Scandinavian market.

In January 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of Calgon
Vestal Laboratories, a wound and skin care and infection control
products business.

In 1994, the Company acquired Matrix Essentials Inc., the leading
manufacturer in North America of professional hair care and beauty
products sold exclusively in beauty salons, and completed the
acquisition of the remaining interest in the UPSA Group which develops
and markets a wide range of nonprescription health and pharmaceutical
products.  The Company sold Squibb Diagnostics and completed the sale
of Xomed-Treace, Inc.

Note 4  RESTRUCTURING
- ---------------------

The Company recorded a $310 million restructuring charge, $198 million
after taxes, in the fourth quarter of 1995.  The restructuring charge
relates to the consolidation of plants and facilities, and related
employee terminations.  The restructuring charge consists of
employee-related costs of $190 million, $100 million of asset write-downs
and $20 million of other related expenses.

net of amounts capitalized, were $78 million, $62 million and $51
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Company has settled its United States Federal income tax returns
through 1989 with the Internal Revenue Service.

United States Federal income taxes have not been provided on substantially
all of the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since it is
management's practice and intent to reinvest such earnings in the
operations of these subsidiaries.  The total amount of the net unremitted
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $2,254 million at
December 31, 1995.

of the remaining ownership interest in the UPSA Group.

The Company has short-term lines of credit with domestic and foreign
banks.  At December 31, 1995, the unused portions of these lines of credit
were approximately $200 million and $597 million, respectively.

Note 11  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- ------------------------------

The Company enters into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to
manage its exposure to currency fluctuations.

The Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities, which approximated $1,385 million, $1,117 million and
$1,210 million at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively,
primarily in Deutsche marks, French francs, Italian lira and Japanese
yen.  The Company mitigates the effect of these exposures through third
party borrowings and foreign exchange forward contracts.

Foreign exchange option contracts, which typically expire within one
year, are used to hedge intercompany shipments expected to occur during
the next year.  Gains on these contracts are deferred and are recognized
in the same period as the hedged transactions.  Certain foreign exchange
forward contracts are used to minimize exposure of foreign currency
transactions and firm commitments to fluctuating exchange rates.  Gains
or losses on these contracts are recognized in the basis of the
transaction being hedged.  The notional amounts of the Company's foreign
exchange option and forward contracts at December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993 were $1,377 million, $1,200 million and $790 million, respectively.

The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its
financial position resulting from its involvement in these instruments,
nor does it anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties.

At December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, the carrying value of all financial
instruments, both short and long-term, approximated their fair values.

Note 12  RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
- ---------------------------------

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension
plans for regular full-time employees.  The principal pension plan is
the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan.  The Company's funding
policy is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to
fund past service liability.

In 1995, the increase in total projected benefit obligation is due to a
lower discount rate and the increase in plan assets is due to
significantly higher earnings and cash contributions.

In 1994, the decrease in plan assets less than projected benefit
obligation and the adjustment required to recognize minimum pension
liability was primarily due to a higher discount rate.

In 1995 and 1994, the adjustment required to recognize minimum pension
liability was recorded in Other Assets.  In 1993, $112 million of the
adjustment required to recognize minimum pension liability was recorded
in Other Assets and $59 million was recorded as a reduction in
Stockholders' Equity.

Plan assets less than projected benefit obligation included $150
million, $120 million and $113 million in an unfunded benefit
equalization plan at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Plan benefits are primarily based on years of credited service and on
participant's compensation.  Plan assets principally consist of equity
securities and fixed income securities.

Each share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into 4.24
shares of common stock and is callable at the Company's option.  The
reductions in the number of issued shares of preferred stock in 1995,
1994 and 1993 were due to conversions into shares of common stock.

Dividends per common share were $2.96 in 1995, $2.92 in 1994 and $2.88
in 1993.

Stock Compensation Plans
- ------------------------
Under the Company's stock option plans, officers, directors and key
employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock
at no less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is
granted.  Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25%
per year on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the
grant date and have a maximum term of ten years.  Additionally, the
plans provide for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby the
grantee may surrender exercisable options and receive common stock
and/or cash measured by the excess of the market price of the common
stock over the option exercise price.  The plans also provide for the
granting of performance-based stock options to certain key executives.

On May 4, 1993, the stockholders approved amendments to the 1983 Stock
Option Plan extending its term for 10 years, authorizing additional
shares in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per year for
each of the additional 10 years, incorporating the Company's existing
long-term performance award plan and providing for the payment of
long-term performance awards in shares of common stock.

Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees,
excluding key executives, meeting certain years of service requirements
are granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at the
market price on the date the options are granted.  The Company has
authorized 15,000,000 shares for issuance under the plan.  A total of
7,673,600 options were granted in 1995 under the plan with 200 options
granted to each eligible employee.  Individual grants generally become
exercisable on or after the third anniversary of the grant date.

The Company's restricted stock award plan provides for the granting of
up to 3,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to
restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death or
normal retirement.  Restrictions generally expire over a five-year
period from date of grant.  Compensation expense is recognized over the
restricted period.  At December 31, 1995, a total of 653,335 shares
were outstanding under the plan.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations
in accounting for its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has
been recognized for its stock-based compensation plans other than for
restricted stock and performance-based awards.  Had compensation cost
for the Company's other stock option plans been determined based upon
the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans
consistent with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced
by approximately $35 million, or $.07 per share.  The fair value of the
options granted during 1995 is estimated as $12.94 on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions: dividend yield 4.2%, volatility of 18.2%, risk-free
interest rate of 6.9%, assumed forfeiture rate of 3%, and an expected
life of 7 years.

Attached to each outstanding share of the Company's common stock is
one Right.  The Rights will be exercisable if a person or group
acquires beneficial interest of 15% or more of the Company's
outstanding common stock, or commences a tender or exchange offer
for 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock.  Each
Right will entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
of a new series of participating preferred stock of the Company at
an exercise price of $200.  The Rights will expire on December 18,
1997.  In the event of certain merger, sale of assets or
self-dealing transactions, each Right will then entitle its holder
to acquire shares having a value of twice the Right's exercise
price.  The Company may redeem the Rights at $.01 per Right at any
time until the 15th day following public announcement that a 15%
position has been acquired.

For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita
cost of covered health care benefits of 9.1% for participants under age 65
and 7.9% for participants age 65 and over was assumed for 1996; the rate
was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.8% in 2007 and to remain at that
level thereafter.  Increasing the assumed medical care cost trend rates by
1 percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995 by $29 million
and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
postretirement benefit expense for the year then ended by $2 million.  The
weighted-average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.3% in 1995, 8.8% in 1994 and 7.0%
in 1993.

Plan assets principally consist of equity securities and fixed income
securities.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was
10.0% in 1995 and 1994 and 11.0% in 1993.

Note 17  CONTINGENCIES
- ----------------------
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered
normal to its businesses are pending against the Company and certain
of its subsidiaries.  The most significant of these are described
below.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------
As of December 31, 1995, approximately 20,000 plaintiffs had filed
suit against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering
Corporation (MEC), and certain other subsidiaries, in federal and
state courts and in certain Canadian provincial courts, alleging
damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from
polyurethane covered breast implants and smooth walled breast
implants.  Most of these plaintiffs are participants in a 1994 class
action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in
Birmingham, Alabama; that settlement is now subject to appeals.  A
revision of that settlement, known as the revised settlement, which
includes the Company, MEC and certain other defendants, was approved
on December 22, 1995.  The order approving the settlement has been
appealed.  The revised settlement, applicable only to domestic
claimants, currently does not include approximately 2,600 claimants
who may assert claims based upon MEC implants and who opted out of
the original settlement.  Separate class action settlements for
eligible claimants have been approved in the provincial courts of
Quebec and Ontario.  In January 1996, a notice of the revised
settlement was mailed to approximately 450,000 persons.  Class
members who wish to do so may now opt out of the revised settlement
although the Court has cautioned class members against doing so until
they receive additional information as to the status of their claims.
It is not possible on any reliable basis to estimate how many class
members will participate in or opt out of the settlement.  The cost
of the settlement is dependent upon complex and varying factors,
including the number of class members that participate in the
settlement, the kinds of claims approved and their dollar value.  The
cost to the Company of resolving opt out claims is also subject to a
number of complex uncertainties in addition to the unknown quantity
and quality of such claims.  In light of the uncertainties attendant
to these and other factors, it is difficult at this time to estimate
with any precision the cost of the breast implant product liability
claims to the Company.  Note 2 sets forth the special charges
recorded in connection with this litigation.  An additional charge to
earnings may be required as additional information relating to the
revised settlement and the litigation becomes known.

Other Actions
- -------------
The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others are defendants in a
number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of
purported statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula
products and by the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and
Mississippi, alleging a price fixing conspiracy and other violations
of state antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws and seeking
penalties and other relief.  On December 6, 1995, a trial in state
court in Wichita, Kansas, in which the Company and Abbott
Laboratories were defendants, concluded with a jury verdict in favor

                                      48

of the defendants.  This was the first infant formula indirect
purchaser case to go to trial.  The courts in Colorado, Florida,
Kentucky, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee have dismissed similar
complaints, and the plaintiffs have or are expected to appeal those
dismissals.  On June 29, 1995, the Texas Supreme Court handed down a
decision in the Company's favor, holding that the plaintiffs, as
indirect purchasers, were barred from proceeding under the Texas
Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act.  The Company
subsequently settled a separate action brought by the Texas Attorney
General.  Motions to certify classes of indirect purchasers of infant
formula have been denied in Minnesota, Michigan and by two courts in
Alabama, but granted by courts in Wisconsin and South Dakota.

As of December 31, 1995, the Company is a defendant in over 100
actions brought against the Company and more than 30 other
pharmaceutical manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit
managers in various federal district courts by certain chain
drugstores, supermarket chains and independent drugstores, suing
either individually or as representatives of a nationwide class of
retail pharmacies that has been certified.  These cases, which have
been coordinated for pretrial purposes, all seek treble damages and
injunctive relief on account of alleged antitrust violations in the
pricing and marketing of brand name prescription drugs.  None of the
plaintiffs has specified the amount of damages claimed, but
plaintiffs in the class action have indicated that they intend to
claim damages, before trebling, ranging from 5% to approximately 20%
of the value of their purchases of brand name prescription drugs from
defendants since October 15, 1989.  It is estimated that the class
represents approximately two-thirds of retail pharmacy purchases of
brand name prescription drugs during the alleged damages period.  The
class action case had been scheduled to go to trial on April 11,
1996.  The Company, without admitting any wrongdoing, reached an
agreement as of January 31, 1996, to settle the class action.  The
settlement is subject to approval by the court.  Federal cases
brought by retail pharmacies that have opted out of the class remain
pending.  Cases brought by retail pharmacies in state court under
state law alleging similar grounds are proceeding in California,
Alabama, Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Cases brought by consumers in
state court under state law alleging similar grounds have been
brought in California, Washington, Colorado, New York, Arizona,
Maine, Alabama and Michigan.

The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise
involved in, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental
Protection Agency or comparable state agencies under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws directed at the
cleanup of hazardous waste sites.

While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
these cases, it is the opinion of management that these lawsuits,
claims and proceedings which are pending against the Company are
without merit or will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's operating results, liquidity or consolidated financial
position.

                     REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                     ---------------------------------


To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company



In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the
related consolidated statements of earnings and retained earnings
and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
