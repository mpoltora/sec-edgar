DESCRIPTION OF BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
- -------------------------------------------

General:
- -------
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("Bristol-Myers Squibb" or the "Company") was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the
name Bristol-Myers Company as successor to a New York business started in 1887.
In 1989, Squibb Corporation merged with a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Company,
and Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a major
producer and distributor of pharmaceutical products, medical devices,
nonprescription health products, toiletries and beauty aids.

Medical Devices:
- ---------------
This segment includes sales of orthopaedic implants, which comprise about forty
percent of the segment's sales, ostomy and wound care products, surgical
instruments and other medical devices.  Some of the principal products in this
segment are the ZIMMER* Total System of artificial hips, the MGII* Total Knee
System and the Insall/Burstein II Modular Total Knee System, orthopaedic

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
- -----------------------------------------
Bristol-Myers Squibb, for the most part, purchases the principal raw materials
and supplies used in each industry segment in the open market.  Substantially
all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of
any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
                                    -  2  -
<PAGE>
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
- --------------------------------
The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United States
and foreign countries covering products, principally in the pharmaceutical
products and medical devices segments, and has also developed many brand names
and trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The Company considers
the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of
material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.  The Company
believes that, except for the patent relating to captopril which expires in the
United States and Germany in 1995, no single patent or license is of material
importance in relation to the business as a whole.


COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
- ---------------------------------------
The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,
heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal means of
competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include
quality, service, price and product performance.  The products of the
pharmaceutical products segment and the medical devices segment are promoted on
a national and international basis in medical journals and directly to the
medical profession.  Most of the other products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are
generally advertised and promoted on a national and international basis through
the use of television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window and
in-store displays.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's products are principally sold to the
wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally.  Certain
products of the pharmaceutical products and medical devices segments are also
sold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None
of the segments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such
that the loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the
segment.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------
Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's businesses,
particularly to the pharmaceutical products segment.  Management continues to
place great emphasis on these activities.  Pharmaceutical research and
development is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute which has major facilities in Princeton and New Brunswick, New
Jersey, Wallingford, Connecticut and Seattle, Washington.  Pharmaceutical
research and development is also carried out at various other facilities in the
United States and in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United
Kingdom.

Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,128 million in 1993, $1,083 million in 1992 and
$983 million in 1991 on company sponsored research and development activities.
Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage of
pharmaceutical sales, increased to 14.9% in 1993 from 14.8% in 1992 and 14.3%
in 1991.


REGULATION
- ----------
Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of government
regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted.  The
Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying
to its products and operations.  For some products, and in some countries,
                                    -  3  -
<PAGE>
government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend to more
stringent regulation.  The Company devotes significant time, effort and expense
addressing the extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its
business.  Governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure
of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the
production or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal sanctions.

In the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and cosmetic
industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation
by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to product
manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.  Assuring compliance
with appropriate laws and regulations requires increasing expenditures of time
and resources.

In addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other
countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in
some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate
drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas already exists in some
countries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other
countries in the future.

While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be
affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its substantial
experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions
on its operations throughout the world and its development of new and improved
products should enable it to compete effectively within this environment.


EMPLOYEES
- ---------
Bristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 49,500 people at December 31, 1993.


DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS
- -------------------------------
Reference is made to Note 17 Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual
Report.

International operations are subject to certain risks which are inherent in
conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or
expropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on foreign
participation in local enterprises and other restrictive governmental actions.
In addition, changes in the relative value of currencies take place from time
to time and their effects may be favorable or unfavorable on Bristol-Myers
Squibb's operations.  There are currency restrictions relating to repatriation
of earnings in certain countries.


Item 2.  PROPERTIES.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's world headquarters is located at 345 Park Avenue, New
York, New York, where it leases approximately 841,800 square feet of floor
space, approximately 225,700 square feet of which is sublet to others.  The
Company's pharmaceutical world headquarters is located in Princeton, New
Jersey.  Other major domestic pharmaceutical facilities are located in
Evansville, Indiana, New Brunswick and Plainsboro, New Jersey and Buffalo and
Syracuse, New York.  The Company's major domestic medical devices facilities
                                    -  4  -
<PAGE>
are located in Warsaw, Indiana, Skillman, New Jersey and Greensboro, North
Carolina.

Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures products at forty-one major worldwide
locations with an aggregate floor space of approximately 11,027,200 square
feet.  Thirty-nine are owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb and two facilities are
leased.  The U.S. manufacturing facilities total seventeen, of which 42% and
29% are used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and medical devices,
respectively.  The non-U.S. operations include a total of twenty-four major
owned manufacturing facilities, of which 79% and 4% are used in the manufacture
of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, respectively.  These facilities
are located in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan,
the United Kingdom and Venezuela, and aggregate approximately 5,929,000 square
feet of space.

Portions of these facilities and other facilities owned or leased by
Bristol-Myers Squibb in the United States and elsewhere are used for research,
administration, storage and distribution.  All of Bristol-Myers Squibb's
facilities are well-maintained, adequately insured and in satisfactory
condition.

Capital expenditures for the construction, expansion and modernization of
production, research and administrative facilities aggregrated $580 million,
$654 million and $633 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.


Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

DES LITIGATION
- --------------
The Company is a defendant in a number of actions brought against it and other
pharmaceutical companies in federal and state courts by the children or
grandchildren of women who ingested diethylstibelstrol (DES), a product which
had been, but is no longer, manufactured or sold by a subsidiary of the
Company.  The Company believes that these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION
- -------------------------
Approximately 11,000 plaintiffs have filed suit against the Company, its
subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation ("MEC"), and certain other
subsidiaries, in federal and state courts and in Canadian provincial courts,
alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from
polyurethane covered breast implants and smooth walled breast implants.
Certain of these cases are class actions which seek to allege claims on behalf
of all breast implant recipients.  All federal court actions have been
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in federal district court in Birmingham,
Alabama.

In late March 1994, the Company, other defendants and certain plaintiffs
entered into a settlement agreement regarding all pending and future breast
implant product liability claims brought in the United States against certain
defendants, including the Company, MEC and certain other subsidiaries.  The
settlement agreement must be submitted for approval to the Hon. Sam C. Pointer,
the federal judge who is presiding over the proceedings in Birmingham, Alabama.
Thereafter, the settlement would not become final until the resolution of any
appeals of Judge Pointer's approval.  Claimants are entitled
                                    -  5  -
<PAGE>
to opt out of the settlement and pursue litigation rather than participate in
the settlement.  The settlement is also dependent on claimants not opting out
in significant numbers.  The settlement provides for the creation of a series
of claims funds to which the settling defendants would contribute various
amounts over approximately 30 years.  The aggregate contribution to be made by
the Company, MEC and certain other subsidiaries shall be no more than $1.154
billion.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500
million before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in connection with pending and
future breast implant product liability claims (See Item 8 of this Report).
The special charge consists of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and
expenses, offset by $1 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  Although the
Company is currently engaged in coverage litigation with certain of its
insurers, such expected insurance proceeds represent the amount of insurance
which the Company considers appropriate to record as recoverable at this time.
The Company believes that ultimately it will obtain substantial additional
amounts of insurance proceeds.  Based on the amounts and timing of the payment
obligations under the settlement, the Company's current estimate of potential
liabilities and expenses that may not be covered by the settlement, and the
amount of insurance proceeds that the Company believes will ultimately be
available, the Company believes that the breast implant actions will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

PATENT PROCEEDINGS
- ------------------
In September 1992, the Company brought an action in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York against Danbury Pharmacal, Inc. for
patent infringement following Danbury's filing of an Abbreviated New Drug
Application which asserted that one of the Company's patents for buspirone
(sold under the brand name BUSPAR*) is invalid and unenforceable.  On June 30,
1993, the District Court granted Danbury's Summary Judgment motion invalidating
the Company's U.S. Patent No. 4,182,763.  The Company appealed the District
Court's decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and awaits the
appellate decision.  The Company believes that the District Court's decision
was erroneous as a matter of fact and law and that the Company will prevail on
its appeal.

In 1991, Zenith Laboratories, Inc. brought an action in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey in which Zenith sought a
declaratory judgment that its cefadroxil product does not infringe the
Company's patent for cefadroxil monohydrate.  In July 1992, following a trial,
the District Court issued a decision finding that the Company's patent for
cefadroxil monohydrate (sold under the brand name DURICEF*) would be infringed
by Zenith's cefadroxil DC.  The District Court ordered that the effective date
of Zenith's FDA approvals for cefadroxil DC capsules and tablets shall not be
earlier than March 12, 2002, the expiration date of the Company's cefadroxil
monohydrate patent.  Zenith appealed the District Court's decision to the Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and on March 24, 1994 the Court of Appeals
reversed the District Court's decision and held that, based on the evidence
before it, the District Court erred in finding that Zenith's product infringes
the Company's patent.  The Company will ask the Court of Appeals either to
reconsider its decision or remand the case to the District Court for further
consideration.

INFANT FORMULA MATTERS
- ----------------------
The Company, one of its subsidiaries and others are defendants in ten antitrust
                                    -  6  -
<PAGE>
actions in seven states (Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Texas
and Wisconsin) filed on behalf of purported statewide classes of indirect
purchasers of infant formula products and by the Attorney General of Texas,
alleging a conspiracy regarding pricing of infant formula products and other
violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade practices laws and seeking
treble damages, statutory and civil penalties and injunctive and other relief.
In one of the Texas actions, the trial court's dismissal of an amended class
action complaint of certain indirect purchasers has been reversed and remanded.
In one of the Alabama actions, the plaintiffs' appeal of the denial of their
motion for class certification was withdrawn.  In addition, the State of
Louisiana has filed a federal court action against the Company and others
asserting claims similar to those previously asserted by the State of Florida
and dismissed by the federal court in the Northern District of Florida.  The
State of Louisiana's case has been transferred for pre-trial purposes to the
Northern District of Florida where a motion to dismiss is pending.  The Nestle
Food Company has filed an action in federal court in the Central District of
California against the Company, one of its subsidiaries and others alleging
that the defendants conspired to restrain competition in and maintain
artificial barriers to entry into the United States infant formula market and
engaged in other violations of federal and state antitrust or other laws.
There are pending investigations of infant formula pricing and marketing by
five state Attorneys General, and the office of the Attorney General of New
Jersey has indicated its intention to begin a similar investigation.  The
Canadian Bureau of Competition Policy has commenced a civil inquiry, and is
contemplating a criminal inquiry, into alleged anticompetitive practices among
the Company and certain other members of the Canadian infant formula industry.
The Company believes that the foregoing matters are without merit and that
their ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated financial position.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING LITIGATION
- ---------------------------------
The Company, along with more than 30 other major pharmaceutical manufacturers
and drug wholesalers, is a defendant in a number of actions brought in various
federal courts around the country seeking damages and injunctive relief under
the federal antitrust laws for alleged antitrust violations in the pricing and
marketing of brand name prescription drugs.  In  addition, the Company, along
with several other pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers and a pharmacy
benefit management company, has been named as a defendant in several actions
filed in California state courts, which involve substantially similar factual
allegations as those made in the federal actions.  These lawsuits are of three
different varieties:  (1) individual actions by independent retail pharmacies;
(2) purported class actions by independent pharmacies seeking to represent a
class comprised of those alleged to be similarly situated; and (3) individual
actions by large retail pharmacy chains and supermarkets.  The federal court
cases, along with additional cases making similar claims but not naming the
Company as a defendant, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  These
cases are still in the pleading stage and no discovery has commenced.  The
Company believes that these actions are without merit and that their ultimate
disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
consolidated financial position.

SECURITIES LITIGATION
- ---------------------
The Company is a defendant in a purported class action filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of
federal securities laws and regulations in connection with, among other things,
                                    -  7  -
<PAGE>
earnings projections.  The Court has certified this action as a class action on
behalf of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise
acquired shares of the Company's common stock between November 18, 1991 and
June 2, 1992.  The Company believes that this action will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
- ---------------------
The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in, a
number of proceedings brought by federal or state environmental agencies under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA or Superfund), or State laws analogous to CERCLA, or to statutes and
regulations which otherwise deal with cleanup of contaminated property.  The
Company believes that these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's consolidated financial position.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


SUMMARY
- -------
During 1993, Bristol-Myers Squibb's worldwide sales of $11.4 billion increased
2% over the prior year. Domestic sales increased 4%, while international sales
remained at prior year levels (a 5% increase excluding the unfavorable effect
of foreign currency translation).

Earnings from continuing operations, excluding the 1993 special charge and a
1992 restructuring charge, increased 8% to $2,269 million and 8% to $4.40 per
share. Including these charges, earnings from continuing operations were $1,959
million, or $3.80 per share, in 1993 and $1,538 million, or $2.97 per share, in
1992.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, a special charge of $500 million before taxes,
$310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share, was recorded in connection with
pending and future breast implant product liability claims against the Company,
its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation, and certain other
subsidiaries. The special charge consists of $1.5 billion for potential
liabilities and expenses related to breast implant claims, offset by $1 billion
of expected insurance proceeds. This special charge is further discussed in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of
this Form 10-K Annual Report.

In the fourth quarter of 1992, a charge of $890 million before taxes, $570
million after taxes, or $1.10 per share, was recorded in connection with
various restructuring actions taken by the Company to strengthen its four core
businesses in recognition of changing worldwide health care trends. This charge
primarily covered the costs of reducing employment levels, including a
voluntary retirement program for the Company's U.S. employees, and streamlining
worldwide production and distribution operations.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong. At December 31, 1993,
the Company held $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and
marketable securities, and working capital increased to $3.5 billion from $3.3
billion at December 31, 1992 and $2.8 billion at December 31, 1991. Cash
provided by operating activities increased to $2.6 billion in 1993 from $2.0
billion and $1.8 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively, and continued to
finance research, new product development and introductions, capital spending
and working capital needs, as well as increased dividend payments. In 1993,
dividends per common share were $2.88, an increase of 4% over 1992. In December
1993, an additional dividend increase of 1.4% was announced, with a 1994
indicated annual payment of $2.92. With this payment, Bristol-Myers Squibb
dividends will have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the
past 10 years.  This increase represents the 22nd consecutive year that the
Company has raised the dividend on its common stock.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's strong financial position is further evidenced by its
ability to maintain a triple A credit rating, a substantial unused borrowing
capacity, a return on stockholders' equity of 32.8% in 1993 and a low long-term
debt to equity ratio.

NET SALES AND EARNINGS
- ----------------------
Worldwide sales increased 2% in 1993 to $11.4 billion, compared to increases of
6% and 9% in 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 1993 consolidated sales growth
resulted from a 3% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to pricing, offset
in part by a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency
translation. Domestic sales increased 4%, while international sales remained at
prior year levels (a 5% increase excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign
currency translation). In 1992, the 6% increase in sales reflected a 4%
increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume and a 1% increase due to
the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Domestic operations,
which were adversely affected by actions taken by wholesalers in 1992 to reduce
their inventories of pharmaceuticals, reported sales growth of 1% in 1992
compared to 10% in 1991, while international operations reported sales growth
of 12% and 7% in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

In 1993, earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were $1,959
million and $3.80 per share, respectively, compared to $1,538 million and $2.97
per share in 1992 and $1,991 million and $3.82 per share in 1991. Excluding the
1993 special charge and the 1992 restructuring charge, earnings from continuing
operations increased 8% to $2,269 million and 8% to $4.40 per share in 1993.

The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before
income taxes was 23.8% in 1993 compared to 22.6% in 1992. Excluding the special
charge in 1993 and the restructuring charge in 1992, the effective income tax
rates were 26.1% and 26.7%, respectively, compared to 28.5% in 1991, reflecting
the continued benefit of increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. As a
result of changes approved in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993,
the Company estimates that its effective tax rate will increase in 1994 to
approximately 30.0%.


EXPENSES
- --------
Total costs and expenses, excluding the 1993 special charge of $500 million and
the 1992 restructuring charge of $890 million, were 73.1% of sales in 1993
compared to 74.2% in 1992 and 73.7% in 1991. As a percentage of sales, cost of
products sold increased in 1993 to 26.5% from 25.6% in 1992 and 25.7% in 1991,
primarily as a result of higher manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical
products.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,
decreased to 27.1% in 1993 from 27.6% in 1992 and 27.9% in 1991. The decline in
1993 reflects reductions in selling expenses, primarily in the U.S., and the
Company's ongoing commitment to contain administrative costs.

The level of advertising and promotion in support of new and existing products
was $1,255 million in 1993 compared to $1,291 million in 1992 and $1,263
million in 1991. The decline in 1993 reflects lower expenditures in the
nonprescription health and pharmaceutical products segments, offset in part by
increased spending in the toiletries and beauty aids segment.

The Company's investment in research and development expenses reached over $1.1
billion, an increase of 4% over 1992. In 1991, research and development
expenses were $983 million. The increase each year reflects the Company's
continued commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas and
                                   -  19  -
<PAGE>
clinical development in support of newer products. Over the last 10 years,
research and development spending has increased nearly fourfold, resulting in a
compound annual growth rate of 14%. Pharmaceutical research and development
spending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, increased to 14.9% in 1993
from 14.8% in 1992 and 14.3% in 1991.


INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
- -----------------
By the end of 1993, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 27 products with more than $100
million in annual sales, including products from all four of the Company's
industry segments.

In 1993, sales in the PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS SEGMENT, which represents the
largest segment at 57% of total company sales, increased 3% to $6,524 million.
The worldwide sales growth resulted from a 5% increase due to volume and a 1%
increase due to pricing, offset in part by a 3% decrease due to the unfavorable
effect of foreign currency translation. Domestic sales increased 11% primarily
due to the Company's newer products, while international sales decreased 4% (a
2% increase excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation).
Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the segment at $2.6
billion, were 2% below prior year levels. Captopril, an angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and the Company's largest selling product, is sold
primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN* (the patent for which expires in the
U.S. and Germany in 1995). Sales of captopril decreased 11% to $1.5 billion as
a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation, a decline in U.S. market
share and reduced sales in certain European countries reflecting restrictive
government cost-containment measures. In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved CAPOTEN* for a novel and expanded use following
heart attacks in patients with impaired function of the left ventricle.
PRAVACHOL*, the Company's newer cholesterol-lowering agent with worldwide sales
exceeding $500 million, and MONOPRIL*, a second generation ACE inhibitor with
once-a-day dosage, performed exceptionally well, with strong volume growth in
the U.S. and in overseas markets. U.S. sales of nadolol, a beta blocker sold
primarily under the trademark CORGARD* (the patent for which expired in the
U.S. in September 1993), remained at prior year levels. Sales of the Company's
anti-infectives increased 2% to over $1.5 billion as increases in CEFZIL*, an
oral cephalosporin antibiotic, VIDEX*, an antiretroviral agent for patients
with AIDS or HIV disease, and DURICEF*, a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin
antibiotic, were offset in part by declines in AMIKIN*, which is experiencing
generic competition, and in AZACTAM*. The Company's line of anti-cancer agents
was the fastest growing product group in the segment, strengthening the
Company's leadership position in cancer therapy. In 1993, sales of anti-cancer
agents increased 19% to $1.2 billion. Introductory sales of TAXOL*, the
Company's anti-cancer agent approved in the U.S. and Canada in December 1992
for treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose first-line or subsequent
chemotherapy has failed, were strong. In the latter part of 1993, TAXOL*
received clearance for marketing in a number of countries in Europe, Latin
America and the Pacific area. Increased sales of VEPESID* (the patent for which
expired in the U.S. in November 1993), PARAPLATIN* and PLATINOL* also
contributed to the growth of anti-cancer agents. Central nervous system drug
sales increased 7%, reflecting domestic growth in sales of BUSPAR*, the
Company's novel anti-anxiety agent, and STADOL NS*, a prescription nasal spray
analgesic. In the area of dermatological drugs, the Company received FDA
approval in December 1993 to market DOVONEX*, a vitamin D3 analogue for the
treatment of moderate psoriasis. Sales of diagnostic agents were below prior
year levels primarily due to ISOVUE*.
                                   -  20  -
<PAGE>
In 1992, pharmaceutical products segment sales increased 7%, with a 4% increase
due to pricing, a 2% increase due to volume and a 1% increase due to the
favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Increases in sales of
CAPOTEN*, PRAVACHOL*, MONOPRIL*, CEFZIL*, VIDEX*, PARAPLATIN* and VEPESID* were
the primary contributors to sales growth. In 1991, sales in the segment
increased 12% primarily as a result of increased cardiovascular,
anti-infective, anti-cancer and central nervous system drug sales.

Operating profit margin in 1993 was 32.7% compared to 31.0% in 1992, excluding
the 1992 charge of $371 million for restructuring pharmaceutical operations.
The increase in 1993 resulted from reductions in selling and advertising
expenses, offset in part by higher manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical
products. In 1992, operating profit margin of 31.0%, excluding the
restructuring charge, was lower than the 31.2% reported in 1991 due to
increased selling and promotion expenses for the Company's new and existing
products.

Sales in the MEDICAL DEVICES SEGMENT increased 2% in 1993 to $1,693 million,
reflecting a 3% increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume and a 2%
decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.
Domestic sales remained at prior year levels, while international sales
increased 4% (9% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency
translation). Worldwide sales of prosthetic implants increased 5%, led by the
Insall/Burstein II Modular Total Knee System, the MGII* Total Knee System and
the CENTRALIGN* Precoat Hip Prosthesis. As a result, the Company continues to
maintain the number one market position worldwide in both the hip and knee
prostheses markets. Sales of ostomy products increased 2% (11% excluding the
unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation) primarily due to volume
growth of the ACTIVE LIFE/COLODRESS* and the SUR-FIT/COMBIHESIVE* product lines
in the U.S. and in international markets. During 1993, the Company introduced
ACTIVE LIFE FLUSHAWAY*, a one-piece, closed-end flushable pouch. In the
Company's line of wound care products, sales increased as a result of strong
volume growth in international markets and the launch of several new DUODERM*
products in the U.S. Sales of the Company's arthroscopy products increased due
to the strong performances of orthopaedic reconstructive systems and power
cutting instruments. In the Company's line of fracture management products, the
Company introduced COLLAGRAFT* Bone Graft Matrix, an alternative to using bone
graft materials from donor bone stock or harvested from the patient.

In 1992, worldwide sales of medical devices increased 7% due to a 5% increase
from pricing, a 1% increase from volume and a 1% increase due to the favorable
effect of foreign currency translation. The sales growth was primarily due to
increased sales of prosthetic implants, ostomy, wound care and arthroscopy
products, offset in part by volume declines of other product lines divested in
1991. In 1991, sales in the segment increased 9% as a result of increases in
knee and hip prostheses and ostomy and wound care products.

During 1993, the Company sold certain assets of Edward Weck Incorporated and
announced the intention to sell its Xomed-Treace subsidiary.

As a result of the $500 million special charge for pending and future breast
implant product liability claims and related expenses, the medical devices
segment recorded an operating loss of $24 million in 1993. Excluding the 1993
special charge and the 1992 restructuring charge of $155 million, operating
profit margin was 28.1% in 1993 compared to 27.6% in 1992. The increase in 1993
reflects declines in selling and administrative expenses. In 1992, operating
profit margin of 27.6%, excluding the restructuring charge, increased from
22.7% in 1991, which included costs associated with the divestiture of certain
                                   -  21  -
<PAGE>
product lines.

In the NONPRESCRIPTION HEALTH PRODUCTS SEGMENT, sales of $1,964 million
remained at prior year levels as a 5% increase due to pricing was offset by a
5% decrease due to volume. Domestic sales decreased 3%, primarily in sales of
EXCEDRIN* and BUFFERIN* analgesics, which were adversely affected by increased
competition in the U.S. market. International sales increased 6%, primarily due
to BUFFERIN*, the leading internal analgesic in Japan, and ISOCAL*, an adult
nutritional product. Worldwide sales of infant formulas increased with the
introduction of LACTOFREE*, a milk-based, lactose-free infant formula
introduced in the U.S. in early 1993, and growth in sales of NUTRAMIGEN* and
Gerber Soy specialty formulas as well as ENFAPRO* and Gerber Baby routine
formulas. These increases were offset in part by reduced sales of ENFAMIL* and
PROSOBEE* under the federal government's Women, Infants and Children (WIC)
program due to the loss of certain sole source contracts in late 1992 and early
1993. In the latter part of 1993, five new WIC contracts, in Pennsylvania,
Missouri, South Carolina, Colorado and Mississippi, became effective.

In 1992, worldwide sales of nonprescription health products increased 3% due to
a 5% increase in pricing, offset in part by a 2% decrease due to volume. The
sales growth was primarily due to increases in international sales of ENFAMIL*,
ENFAPRO* and PROSOBEE* infant formulas and BUFFERIN* analgesics. In 1991, sales
in the segment increased 7% as a result of Gerber Baby Formula, ENFAPRO*,
PROSOBEE*, SUSTAGEN*, EXCEDRIN* IB, EXCEDRIN PM* and BUFFERIN* AF Nite Time.

Operating profit margin of 23.6% in 1993 remained relatively unchanged from the
23.7% reported in 1992, excluding the 1992 charge of $150 million for
restructuring worldwide operations of the nonprescription health products
segment and a $46 million charge for the cost of settlements relating to the
Company's infant formula business. In 1992, operating profit margin of 23.7%,
excluding the 1992 charges, increased from 22.9% in 1991.

Sales in the TOILETRIES AND BEAUTY AIDS SEGMENT increased 1% in 1993 to $1,232
million, reflecting a 2% increase due to pricing, a 1% increase due to volume
and a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency
translation. Domestic sales increased 1%, and international sales increased 2%.
Sales of the Company's haircoloring products increased, as GLINTS* Conditioning
Color Enhancer, a new haircoloring product introduced in the U.S. aimed at new
and younger users, performed exceptionally well during its first year, as did
LASTING COLOR BY LOVING CARE* and BRIGHTS BY NICE 'N EASY*. Sales of skin care
products increased due to international growth of SEA BREEZE* and sales from
Laboratori Guieu, an Italian over-the-counter skin care company acquired in
early 1993. In the Company's line of anti-perspirants, sales of BAN* increased,
reflecting the introduction of BAN CLEAR* A.P., a clear solid anti-perspirant,
launched in the U.S. and Canada.

In 1992, sales in the toiletries and beauty aids segment increased 1% due to a
3% increase in pricing, offset in part by a 2% decrease in volume. Increased
sales of anti-perspirants and haircoloring products were partially offset by
declines of beauty appliances and other hair care products. In 1991, sales in
the segment decreased 5% as increased sales of haircoloring products and
anti-perspirants were more than offset by declines in other brands.

In December 1993, the Company sold the beauty appliance division of Clairol.

Operating profit margin in 1993 was 13.2% compared to 13.1% in 1992, after
adjusting for the 1992 charge of $150 million for restructuring the worldwide
toiletries and beauty aids segment. In 1992, operating profit margin of 13.1%,
                                   -  22  -
<PAGE>
excluding the restructuring charge, decreased from 16.9% in 1991 partially due
to increased advertising and promotion expenditures as a percentage of sales.

In 1993, sales of the Company's domestic operations increased 4% primarily as a
result of gains in the pharmaceutical products segment. Operating profit margin
from domestic operations was 23.2% in 1993 compared to 19.9% in 1992. Excluding
the 1993 special charge of $500 million and the 1992 restructuring charge of
$595 million, operating profit margin increased to 29.8% in 1993 from 28.0% in
1992. The increase reflects declines in selling and administrative expenses,
offset in part by increased manufacturing costs of newer pharmaceutical
products. In 1992, domestic sales, which were adversely affected by actions
taken by wholesalers to reduce their inventories of pharmaceuticals, increased
1%. Operating profit margin, after adjusting for the 1992 restructuring charge,
was 28.0% compared to 28.1% in 1991 in part due to increased selling and
promotion expenses.

Internationally, sales in 1993 remained at prior year levels. Excluding the
unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, international sales
increased 5% in the year. International sales increased 12% in 1992 and 7% in
1991.

Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, decreased 8% in
1993 as a result of unfavorable foreign currency translation as well as lower
pharmaceutical sales in certain European countries reflecting restrictive
government cost-containment measures. Operating profit margin was 19.3%
compared to 21.1% in 1992, excluding the 1992 restructuring charge of $134
million, primarily as a result of declines in the pharmaceutical products
segment. In 1992, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 13%,
reflecting growth of PRAVACHOL*, CAPOTEN*, prosthetic implants, ostomy and
wound care products, as well as introductory sales of MONOPRIL* in Italy.
Operating profit margin, excluding the 1992 restructuring charge, was 21.1%
compared to 22.1% in 1991.

Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 5% in 1993, primarily due
to increased sales of anti-infectives, cardiovasculars, haircoloring products
and anti-perspirants in Latin America. Operating profit margin of 20.0%
remained relatively unchanged from the 20.1% reported in 1992, excluding the
1992 restructuring charge of $51 million. In 1992, sales in Other Western
Hemisphere countries increased 8% primarily due to volume growth of
cardiovasculars, anti-infectives and infant formulas in Latin America.
Operating profit margin was 20.1% in 1992, excluding the restructuring charge,
compared to 19.8% in 1991.

Sales in the Pacific area increased 15% in 1993 as a result of favorable
foreign currency translation and increased sales of prosthetic implants, infant
formulas and anti-cancer drugs. Operating profit margin was 15.8% compared to
12.6% in 1992, excluding the 1992 restructuring charge of $46 million,
primarily as a result of improvements in the pharmaceutical products and
medical devices segments. In 1992, Pacific area sales increased 12% due to
growth of infant formulas, prosthetic implants, cardiovascular drugs and
analgesics. Operating profit margin was 12.6%, excluding the 1992 restructuring
charge, compared to 10.3% in 1991, reflecting improvements in the medical
devices segment.

FINANCIAL POSITION
- ------------------
The Company considers cash, including cash equivalents, time deposits and
marketable securities as its principal measure of liquidity. These items
totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 1993, increasing from $2.4 billion and
$1.6 billion at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The Company also
continues to maintain a high level of working capital, increasing to $3.5
billion at December 31, 1993 from $3.3 billion at December 31, 1992 and $2.8
billion at December 31, 1991. The Company's current ratio at December 31, 1993
increased to 2.14 from 2.01 in 1992 and 2.02 in 1991. Cash and cash
equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities and the conversion of
other working capital items to cash are expected to be adequate to fund the
operations of the Company and any product liability claims and related
expenses.

Short-term borrowings decreased to $177 million from $375 million and $553
million at December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively, reflecting repayments of
international borrowings. In June 1993, the Company issued $350 million
principal amount of 7.15% Debentures Due 2023, for general corporate purposes,
including stock purchase programs, working capital, capital expenditures,
repayment or refinancing of borrowings and acquisitions.

Internally generated cash from operations continued to increase in 1993 to $2.6
billion from $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively,
reflecting the Company's ongoing commitment to improve cash flow and working
capital needs. Cash provided by operations continued to be the primary source
for financing expenditures for new plant and equipment. Over the past three
years, the Company has invested $1.9 billion in capital expansion in its
commitment to maintain superior production and research facilities and to
improve plant efficiency. Cash from operations also was used to pay dividends
of nearly $4.2 billion during the past three years, and to fund the $1.1
billion purchase of over 16 million shares of the Company's common stock over
the same period.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           (in millions of dollars)


Note 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------

Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include
securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase,
recorded at cost, which approximates market.

Time Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable
securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which
approximates cost.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not in
excess of market.

Property and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and
betterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally computed by the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets.

Excess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net tangible
assets received in business acquisitions subsequent to October 31, 1970 is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding forty
years.

Earnings Per Share - Earnings per common share are computed using the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year.  The effect of shares
issuable under stock plans is not significant.


Note 2  SPECIAL CHARGE
- ----------------------

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a special charge of $500
million before taxes, $310 million after taxes, or $.60 per share, in
connection with pending and future breast implant product liability claims
against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation, and
certain other subsidiaries.  The special charge consists of $1.5 billion for
potential liabilities and expenses related to breast implant claims ($1.4
billion recorded as a long-term liability in Product Liability and $.1 billion
recorded as a current liability in Accrued Expenses), offset by $1 billion of
expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance Recoverable).  Although the
Company is currently engaged in coverage litigation with certain of its
insurers, such expected insurance proceeds represent the amount of insurance
which the Company considers appropriate to record as recoverable at this time.
The Company believes that ultimately it will obtain substantial additional
amounts of insurance proceeds.  See Note 18.

Note 3  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
- -------------------------------

On December 31, 1992, the Company completed the sale of The Drackett Company,
its household products business, to S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., for $1.15 billion
in cash.  The sale resulted in a gain of $952 million before taxes, $605
million after taxes, or $1.17 per share.  Drackett has been reported as a
discontinued operation.

Summary results of Drackett's operations in 1992 and 1991 were:

Note 4  PROVISION FOR RESTRUCTURING
- -----------------------------------

In the fourth quarter of 1992, a charge of $890 million before taxes was
recorded in connection with various restructuring actions taken by the Company
to strengthen its four core businesses in recognition of changing worldwide
health care trends.  This charge primarily covered the costs of reducing
employment levels, including a voluntary retirement program for the Company's
U.S. employees, and streamlining worldwide production and distribution
operations.  The after-tax effect of the charge was $570 million, or $1.10 per
share.


Note 5  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
- ------------------------------------

Cumulative translation adjustments, which represent the effect of translating
assets and liabilities of the Company's non-U.S. entities, except those in
highly inflationary economies, were:

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                           (in millions of dollars)


Gains (Losses) reflected in earnings from continuing operations in 1993, 1992
and 1991 of $21 million, $(63) million and $(44) million, respectively, net of
applicable income taxes, resulted from foreign currency transactions and
translation adjustments related to non-U.S. entities operating in highly
inflationary economies.  In 1993, the gain reflected $86 million (included in
Other Income and Expenses) from foreign currency transactions and translation
adjustments, offset by $52 million of reductions in gross margin from charging
cost of products sold with inventory at historic rates.  In 1992 and 1991, the
losses primarily reflected reductions in gross margins.


Note 6  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES

Interest expense was reduced by $14 million in 1993, $13 million in 1992 and
$12 million in 1991 due to interest capitalized on major property, plant and
equipment projects.  Cash payments for interest, net of amounts capitalized,
were $51 million, $46 million and $47 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

tax rate to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as a

The Company has settled its United States Federal income tax returns through
1987 with the Internal Revenue Service.

United States Federal income taxes have not been provided on substantially all
of the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since it is management's
practice and intent to reinvest such earnings in the operations of these
subsidiaries.  The total amount of the net unremitted earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries was approximately $1,562 million at December 31, 1993.

In 1993, the increase in the actuarial present value of accumulated benefit
obligation and in plan assets less than projected benefit obligation was
primarily due to a lower discount rate and the effect of the voluntary
retirement program offered to the Company's U.S. employees.

In 1993, $112 million of the adjustment required to recognize minimum pension
liability was recorded in Other Assets and $59 million was recorded as a
reduction in Stockholders' Equity.

Plan benefits are primarily based on years of credited service and on
participant's compensation.  Plan assets principally consist of equity
securities and fixed income securities.


Note 14  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
- ---------------------------------------------------------

The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits to
substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company's
comprehensive medical and group life plans.  The medical plan is contributory.
Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the
original retiring company.  The life insurance plan is non-contributory.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,  Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (FAS 106).  This statement requires
that the costs of postretirement benefits, primarily health care benefits, be
accrued during an employee's active working career.  In prior years, these
costs were expensed as paid.  The Company recorded the discounted value of
expected future benefits attributed to employees' service rendered prior to
1992 as a cumulative effect of an accounting change.  This one-time non-cash
accounting change was $390 million before taxes, $246 million after taxes, or
$.47 per share.

In 1993, the increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
primarily due to a lower discount rate and the effect of the voluntary
retirement program offered to the Company's U.S. employees.

For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits of 12.3% for participants under age 65 and 10.2%
for participants age 65 and over was assumed for 1994; the rate was assumed to
decrease gradually to 5.2% in 2007 and to remain at that level thereafter.
Increasing the assumed medical care cost trend rates by 1 percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as
of December 31, 1993 by $28 million and the aggregate of the service and
interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense for the year
then ended by $2 million.  The weighted-average discount rate used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.0% in 1993
and 8.2% in 1992.

Plan assets principally consist of equity securities and fixed income
securities.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 11.0% in
1993 and 12.0% in 1992.

The cost of postretirement benefits was expensed as paid prior to the adoption
of FAS 106 and totaled $18 million in 1991.

Dividends per common share were $2.88 in 1993, $2.76 in 1992 and $2.40 in 1991.

Under the Company's stock option plans, officers, directors and key employees
may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at 100% of the
market price on the day the option is granted.  Additionally, the plans provide
for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may surrender
exercisable options and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess
of the market price of the common stock over the option exercise price.

On May 4, 1993, the stockholders approved amendments to the 1983 Stock Option
Plan extending its term for 10 years, authorizing additional shares in the
amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per year for each of the additional 10
years, incorporating the Company's existing long-term performance award plan
and providing for the payment of long-term performance awards in shares of
common stock valued at 100% of the market price on the date of payment.

The Company's restricted stock award plan provides for the granting of up to
3,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to restrictions as
to continuous employment except in the case of death or normal retirement.
Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period from date of grant.  At
December 31, 1993, a total of 834,500 shares were outstanding under the plan.

Note 18  CONTINGENCIES
- ----------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its
businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
The most significant of these are described below.

As of December 31, 1993, approximately 10,000 plaintiffs have filed suit
against the Company, its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation, and
certain other subsidiaries, in federal and state courts and in certain Canadian
provincial courts, alleging damages for personal injuries of various types
resulting from polyurethane covered breast implants and smooth walled breast
implants.  Certain of these cases are class actions which seek to allege claims
on behalf of all breast implant recipients.  All federal court actions have
been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in federal District Court in
Birmingham, Alabama.  See Note 2 relating to the special charge recorded in
connection with this litigation.

The Company is a defendant in a number of actions brought against it and other
pharmaceutical companies in federal and state courts by the children or
grandchildren of women who ingested diethylstilbestrol (DES), a product which
had been, but is no longer, manufactured or sold by an affiliate of the
Company.

The Company is a defendant in several state antitrust actions (one of which has
been removed to federal court) filed on behalf of purported classes of
individual purchasers of infant formula products, and by one State Attorney
General, alleging a conspiracy regarding pricing of infant formula products and
other violations of state antitrust or deceptive trade practice laws and
seeking treble damages, statutory and civil penalties and injunctive relief.
Six other state Attorneys General and the Canadian Bureau of Competitive Policy
have commenced or stated an intention to commence investigations of pricing
practices and marketing activities in the infant formula industry.  The Company
is also a defendant in two federal court actions, one filed by the State of
Louisiana on behalf of indirect purchasers of infant formula alleging a
conspiracy regarding pricing of infant formula products and seeking treble
damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief and the other filed by Nestle
Food Company alleging anticompetitive practices in violation of federal and
state antitrust or other laws and seeking treble damages, civil penalties and
injunctive relief.

As of December 31, 1993, the Company was a defendant with other major
pharmaceutical manufacturers and drug wholesalers in 25 actions brought in
various federal courts by retail pharmacies, individually or as representatives
of purported class actions, which allege anticompetitive or unfair practices in
the pricing and distribution of pharmaceuticals in violation of federal and
state laws and which seek treble damages and injunctive relief.  As of December
31, 1993, the Company was also a co-defendant in four state court actions in
California brought by retail pharmacies, individually or as representatives of
purported class actions, which allege discrimination in the pricing of
pharmaceuticals in violation of California laws and which seek treble damages
and injunctive relief.

The Company is a defendant in a purported class action filed in June 1992 in
                                   -  46  -

                           (in millions of dollars)

the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging
violations of federal securities laws and regulations in connection with, among
other things, earnings projections.

The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in, a
number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or
Superfund) directed at the cleanup of Superfund sites.

While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases,
it is the opinion of management that all lawsuits, claims and proceedings which
are pending against the Company are without merit or will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position.

                      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
                      ---------------------------------


To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company



In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 52 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 1992,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.

6.       Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of
         the Company must be effected at a duly called annual or special
         meeting of such stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in

         may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Chairman of the
         Board or to the Secretary of the Company.  Such resignation shall take

         of a director may be made by the Board of Directors.

         of directors or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from
         office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the
         holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of stock of the

         other cause shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority
         of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a
         quorum of the Board of Directors.  Any director elected in accordance

                            1983 STOCK OPTION PLAN

 1. Purpose:The purpose of the 1983 Stock Option Plan (as amended and restated
    as of January 1, 1993) (the "Plan") is to secure for the Company and its
    stockholders the benefits of the incentive inherent in common stock
    ownership by the officers and key employees of the Company and its
    Subsidiaries and Affiliates who will be largely responsible for the
    Company's future growth and continued financial success and by providing
    long-term incentives in addition to current compensation to certain key
    executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who
    contribute significantly to the long-term performance and growth of the
    Company and such Subsidiaries and Affiliates.  It is intended that the
    former purpose will be effected through the grant of stock options and
    stock appreciation rights under the Plan and that the latter purpose will
    be effected through an award conditionally granting performance units under
    the Plan, either independently or in conjunction with and related to a
    nonqualified stock option grant under the Plan.  The Bristol-Myers Squibb
    Company Long-Term Performance Award Plan (as amended to January 17, 1983

                     not less than three directors who shall serve at the
                     pleasure of the Board.  No member of the Committee shall

                                    E-2-2
<PAGE>
                     have been within one year prior to appointment to, or
                     while serving on, the Committee granted or awarded equity
                     securities of the Company pursuant to this or any other
                     plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
                     except to the extent that participation in any such plan
                     or receipt of any such grant or award would not adversely
                     affect the Committee member's status as a disinterested
                     person for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

                     The Committee, from time to time, may adopt rules and
                     regulations for carrying out the provisions and purposes
                     of the Plan and make such other determinations, not
                     inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee
                     shall deem appropriate.  The interpretation and
                     construction of any provision of the Plan by the Committee
                     shall, unless otherwise determined by the Board of
                     Directors, be final and conclusive.

                     The Committee shall maintain a written record of its
                     proceedings.  A majority of the Committee shall constitute
                     a quorum, and the acts of a majority of the members
                     present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or
                     acts unanimously approved in writing, shall be the acts of
                     the Committee.

 5. Eligibility:     Options and awards may be granted only to present or
                     future officers and key employees of the Company and its
                     Subsidiaries and Affiliates, including Subsidiaries and
                     Affiliates which become such after the adoption of the
                     Plan.  Any officer or key employee of the Company or of
                     any such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall be eligible to
                     receive one or more options or awards under the Plan.  Any
                     director who is not an officer or employee of the Company
                     or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and any member of
                     the Committee, during the time of the member's service as
                     such or thereafter, shall be ineligible to receive an
                     option or award under the Plan.  The adoption of this Plan
                     shall not be deemed to give any officer or employee any
                     right to an award or to be granted an option to purchase
                     Common Stock of the Company, except to the extent and upon
                     such terms and conditions as may be determined by the
                     Committee.

 6. Stock Options:   Stock options under the Plan shall consist of incentive
                     stock options under Section 422 of the Code or
                     nonqualified stock options (options not intended to
                     qualify as incentive stock options), as the Committee
                     shall determine.  In addition, the Committee may grant
                     stock appreciation rights in conjunction with an option,
                     as set forth in Section 6(b)(11), or may grant awards in
                     conjunction with an option, as set forth in Section
                     6(b)(10) (an "Associated Option").

    Each option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

    (a) Grant of Options.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key
        employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom
        options may from time to time be granted, (2) determine whether

                                    E-2-3
<PAGE>
        incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, are to be
        granted, (3) determine the number of shares to be covered by each
        option so granted, (4) determine the terms and conditions (not
        inconsistent with the Plan) of any option granted hereunder (including
        but not limited to restrictions upon the options, conditions of their
        exercise, or on the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
        thereof), (5) determine whether nonqualified stock options or incentive
        stock options granted under the Plan shall include stock appreciation
        rights and, if so, shall determine the terms and conditions thereof in
        accordance with Section 6(b)(11) hereof, (6) determine whether any
        nonqualified stock options granted under the Plan shall be Associated
        Options, and (7) prescribe the form of the instruments necessary or
        advisable in the administration of options.

    (b) Terms and Conditions of Option.  Any option granted under the Plan
        shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement executed by the Company
        and the optionee, in such form as the Committee shall approve, which
        agreement shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and
        shall contain such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent
        with the Plan, and in the case of an incentive stock option not
        inconsistent with the provisions of the Code applicable to incentive
        stock options, as the Committee shall prescribe:

    (1) Number of Shares Subject to an Option.  The Stock Option Agreement
        shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
        Agreement.  If the option is an Associated Option, the number of shares
        of Common Stock subject to such Associated Option shall initially be
        equal to the number of performance units subject to the award, but one
        share of Common Stock shall be canceled for each performance unit paid
        out under the award.

    (2) Option Price.  The purchase price per share of Common Stock purchasable
        under an option will be determined by the Committee but will be not
        less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date
        of the grant of such option.

    (3) Option Period.  The period of each option shall be fixed by the
        Committee, but no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of
        ten years from the date the option is granted.

    (4) Consideration.  Each optionee, as consideration for the grant of an
        option, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or of one
        of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year from the date
        of the granting of such option, and no option shall be exercisable
        until after the completion of such one year period of employment by the
        optionee.

    (5) Exercise of Option.  An option may be exercised in whole or in part
        from time to time during the option period (or, if determined by the
        Committee, in specified installments during the option period) by
        giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number
        of shares to be purchased, such notice to be accompanied by payment in
        full of the purchase price and Withholding Taxes (as defined in Section
        10 hereof) due either by certified or bank check, or in shares of
        Common Stock of the Company owned by the optionee having a Fair Market
        Value at the date of exercise equal to such purchase price and
        Withholding Taxes due, or in a combination of the foregoing; provided,
        however, that payment in shares of Common Stock of the Company will not

                                    E-2-4
<PAGE>
        be permitted unless at least 100 shares of Common Stock are required
        and delivered for such purpose.  No shares shall be issued until full
        payment therefor has been made.  An optionee shall have the rights of a
        stockholder only with respect to shares of stock for which certificates
        have been issued to the optionee.

    (6) Nontransferability of Options.  No option or stock appreciation right
        granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise
        than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such
        option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable, during the
        optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee.

    (7) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or
        Disability.  If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the Company
        or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason (other than
        termination of employment by reason of death or Disability) after the
        optionee shall have been continuously so employed for one year after
        the granting of the option, the option shall be exercisable only to the
        extent that the optionee was otherwise entitled to exercise it at the
        time of such cessation of employment with the Company, Subsidiary or
        Affiliate, but in no event after the expiration of the option period
        set forth therein except that in the case of cessation of employment
        other than by reason of Retirement or death, the option shall in no
        event be exercisable after the date three months next succeeding such
        cessation of employment.  The Plan does not confer upon any optionee
        any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company or
        any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

    (8) Disability of Optionee.  An optionee who ceases to be employed by
        reason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee remained
        in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate until the
        earlier of (i) cessation of payments under a disability pay plan of the
        Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, (ii) the optionee's death, or (iii)
        the optionee's 65th birthday.

    (9) Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of the optionee while in
        the employ of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
        or within whichever period after Retirement or cessation of employment
        of the optionee specified in subsection (7) or (8) is applicable, and
        provided the optionee shall have been continuously so employed for one
        year after the granting of the option, the option shall be exercisable
        by the executors, administrators, legatees or distributees of the
        optionee's estate, as the case may be, at any time following death but
        in no event after the expiration of the option period set forth therein
        and only to the extent that the optionee would otherwise have been
        entitled to exercise it if the optionee were then living, except that
        in the case of the death of an optionee after Retirement or other
        cessation of employment, the option shall in no event be exercisable
        after the later of (i) the date twelve months next succeeding such
        death or (ii) the last day of the period after Retirement or other
        cessation of employment of the optionee specified in Section 6(b)(7).
        In the event any option is exercised by the executors, administrators,
        legatees or distributees of the estate of a deceased optionee, the
        Company shall be under no obligation to issue stock thereunder unless
        and until the Company is satisfied that the person or persons
        exercising the option are the duly appointed legal representatives of
        the deceased optionee's estate or the proper legatees or distributees
        thereof.

                                    E-2-5

   (10) Long Term Performance Awards.  The Committee may from time to time
        grant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with and
        related to an award of performance units made under a Long Term
        Performance Award as set forth in Section 7(b)(11).  In such event,
        notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (i) the number of shares to
        which the Associated Option applies shall initially be equal to the
        number of performance units granted by the award, but such number of
        shares shall be reduced on a one share-for-one unit basis to the extent
        that the Committee determines pursuant to the terms of the award, to
        pay to the optionee or the optionee's beneficiary the performance units
        granted pursuant to such award; and (ii) such Associated Option shall
        be cancelable in the discretion of the Committee, without the consent
        of the optionee, under the conditions and to the extent specified in
        the award.

   (11) Stock Appreciation Rights.  In the case of any option granted under the
        Plan, either at the time of grant or by amendment of such option at any
        time after such grant there may be included a stock appreciation right
        which shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent
        with the Plan, as the Committee shall impose, including the following:

    (A) A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable to the extent, and only
        to the extent, that the option in which it is included is at the time
        exercisable, and may be exercised within such period only at such time
        or times as may be determined by the Committee;

    (B) A stock appreciation right shall entitle the optionee (or any person
        entitled to act under the provisions of subsection (9) hereof) to
        surrender unexercised the option in which the stock appreciation right
        is included (or any portion of such option) to the Company and to
        receive from the Company in exchange therefor that number of shares
        having an aggregate value equal to (or, in the discretion of the
        Committee, less than) the excess of the value of one share (provided
        such value does not exceed such multiple of the option price per share
        as may be specified by the Committee) over the option price per share
        specified in such option times the number of shares called for by the
        option, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered.  The Committee
        shall be entitled to cause the Company to settle its obligation,
        arising out of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, by the
        payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares the Company
        would otherwise be obligated to deliver or partly by the payment of
        cash and partly by the delivery of shares.  Any such election shall be
        made within 30 business days after the receipt by the Committee of
        written notice of the exercise of the stock appreciation right.  The
        value of a share for this purpose shall be the Fair Market Value
        thereof on the last business day preceding the date of the election to
        exercise the stock appreciation right;

    (C) No fractional shares shall be delivered under this subsection (11) but
        in lieu thereof a cash adjustment shall be made;

    (D) If a stock appreciation right included in an option is exercised, such
        option shall be deemed to have been exercised to the extent of the
        number of shares called for by the option or portion thereof which is
        surrendered on exercise of the stock appreciation right and no new
        option may be granted covering such shares under this Plan; and

    (E) If an option which includes a stock appreciation right is exercised,

                                    E-2-6
<PAGE>
        such stock appreciation right shall be deemed to have been canceled to
        the extent of the number of shares called for by the option or portion
        thereof is exercised and no new stock appreciation rights may be
        granted covering such shares under this Plan.

   (12) Incentive Stock Options.  In the case of any incentive stock option
        granted under the Plan, the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares
        of Common Stock of the Company (determined at the time of grant of each
        option) with respect to which incentive stock options granted under the
        Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent or a Subsidiary
        which are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any
        calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 or such other amount as may be
        required by the Code.  In any year, the maximum number of shares with
        respect to which incentive stock options may be granted shall not
        exceed 4,000,000 shares.

    7.  Long-term Performance Awards:  Awards under the Plan shall consist of
        the conditional grant to the participants of a specified number of
        performance units.  The conditional grant of a performance unit to a
        participant will entitle the participant to receive a specified dollar
        value, variable under conditions specified in the award, if the
        performance objectives specified in the award are achieved and the
        other terms and conditions thereof are satisfied.

    Each award will be subject to the following terms and conditions:

    (a) Grant of Awards.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key
        executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom
        awards may from time to time be granted, (2) determine the number of
        performance units covered by each award, (3) determine the terms and
        conditions of each performance unit awarded and the award period and
        performance objectives with respect to each award, (4) determine the
        periods during which a participant may request the Committee to approve
        deferred payment of a percentage (50% or 100%) of an award (the
        "Deferred Portion") and the interest or rate of return thereon or the
        basis on which such interest or rate of return thereon is to be
        determined, (5) determine whether payment with respect to the portion
        of an award which has not been deferred (the "Current Portion") and the
        payment with respect to the Deferred Portion of an award shall be made
        entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and
        partially in Common Stock, (6) determine whether the award is to be
        made independently of or in conjunction with a nonqualified stock
        option granted under the Plan, and (7) prescribe the form of the
        instruments necessary or advisable in the administration of the awards.

    (b) Terms and Conditions of Award.  Any award conditionally granting
        performance units to a participant shall be evidenced by a Performance
        Unit Agreement executed by the Company and the participant, in such
        form as the Committee shall approve, which Agreement shall contain in
        substance the following terms and conditions and such additional terms
        and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe:

    (1) Number of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall
        specify the number of performance units conditionally granted to the
        participant.  If the award has been made in conjunction with the grant
        of an Associated Option, the number of performance units granted shall
        initially be equal to the number of shares which the participant is
        granted the right to purchase pursuant to the Associated Option, but

                                    E-2-7
<PAGE>
        one performance unit shall be canceled for each share of the Company's
        Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Associated Option or for
        each stock appreciation right included in such option that has been
        exercised.

    (2) Value of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall
        specify the threshold, target and maximum dollar values of each
        performance unit and corresponding performance objectives as provided
        under Section 7(b)(5).

    (3) Award Periods.  For each award, the Committee shall designate an award
        period with a duration to be determined by the Committee in its
        discretion but in no event less than three calendar years within which
        specified performance objectives are to be attained.  There may be
        several award periods in existence at any one time and the duration of
        performance objectives may differ from each other.

    (4) Consideration.  Each participant, as consideration for the award of
        performance units, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company
        or of one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year after
        the date of the making of such award, and no award shall be payable
        until after the completion of such one year of employment by the
        participant.

    (5) Performance Objectives.  The Committee shall establish performance
        objectives with respect to the Company for each award period on the
        basis of such criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the
        Committee may from time to time determine.  Performance objectives may
        include objective and subjective criteria.  During any award period,
        the Committee may adjust the performance objectives for such award
        period as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring
        events affecting the Company, changes in applicable tax laws or
        accounting principles, or such other factors as the Committee may
        determine.

    (6) Determination and Payment of Performance Units Earned.  As soon as
        practicable after the end of an award period, the Committee shall
        determine the extent to which awards have been earned on the basis of
        the Company's actual performance in relation to the established
        performance objectives as set forth in the Performance Unit Agreement.
        The Performance Unit Agreement shall specify that as soon as
        practicable after the end of each award period, the Committee shall
        determine whether the conditions of Sections 7(b)(4) and 7(b)(5) hereof
        have been met and, if so, shall ascertain the amount payable to the
        participant in respect of the performance units.  As promptly as
        practicable after it has determined that an amount is payable in
        respect of an award, the Committee shall cause the Current Portion of
        such award to be paid to the participant or the participant's
        beneficiaries, as the case may be, in the Committee's discretion,
        either entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash
        and partially in Common Stock.  The Deferred Portion of an award shall
        be contingently credited and payable to the participant over a deferred
        period and shall be credited with interest or a rate of return, as
        determined by the Committee.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall
        determine the conditions upon, and method of, payment of such deferred
        portions and whether such payment will be made entirely in cash,
        entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common
        Stock.

                                    E-2-8
<PAGE>
        In making the payment of an award in Common Stock hereunder, the cash
        equivalent of such Common Stock shall be determined by the Fair Market
        Value of the Common Stock on the day the Committee designates the
        performance units shall be paid.

    (7) Nontransferability of Awards and Designation of Beneficiaries.  No
        award under the Plan shall be transferable by the participant other
        than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, except that a
        participant may designate a beneficiary pursuant to the provisions
        hereof.

        If any participant or the participant's beneficiary shall attempt to
        assign the participant's rights under the Plan in violation of the
        provisions thereof, the Company's obligation to make any further
        payments to such participant or the participant's beneficiaries shall
        forthwith terminate.

        A participant may name one or more beneficiaries to receive any payment
        of an award to which the participant may be entitled under the Plan in
        the event of the participant's death, on a form to be provided by the
        Committee.  A participant may change the participant's beneficiary
        designation from time to time in the same manner.

        If no designated beneficiary is living on the date on which any payment
        becomes payable to a participant's beneficiary, such payment will be
        payable to the person or persons in the first of the following classes
        of successive preference:

    (i) Widow or widower, if then living,
   (ii) Surviving children, equally,
  (iii) Surviving parents, equally,
   (iv) Surviving brothers and sisters, equally,
    (v) Executors or administrators

        and the term "beneficiary" as used in the Plan shall include such
        person or persons.

    (8) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other Than by Death or
        Disability.  In the event of the Retirement prior to the end of an
        award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year employment
        requirement of Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an award prior to
        Retirement, the participant, or his estate, shall be entitled to a
        payment of such award at the end of the award period, pursuant to the
        terms of the Plan and the participant's Performance Unit Agreement,
        provided, however, that the participant shall be deemed to have earned
        that proportion (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the
        performance units granted to the participant under such award as the
        number of months of the award period which have elapsed since the first
        day of the calendar year in which the award was made to the end of the
        month in which the participant's Retirement occurs, bears to the total
        number of months in the award period.  The participant's rights in any
        remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

        Subject to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, the Performance Unit Agreement shall
        specify that the rights of the participant in the performance units
        granted to such participant shall be conditional and shall be canceled,
        forfeited and surrendered if the participant's continuous employment
        with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall terminate

                                    E-2-9
<PAGE>
        for any reason, other than the participant's death, Disability or
        Retirement prior to the end of the award period.

        The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, the
        cancellation, forfeiture and surrender of any performance units.

    (9) Disability of Participant.  For the purposes of any award a participant
        who becomes Disabled shall be deemed to have suspended active
        employment by reason of Disability commencing on the date the
        participant becomes entitled to receive payments under a disability pay
        plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate and continuing until
        the date the participant is no longer entitled to receive such
        payments.  In the event a participant becomes Disabled during an award
        period but only if the participant has satisfied the one year
        employment requirement of Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an award
        prior to becoming Disabled, upon the determination by the Committee of
        the extent to which an award has been earned pursuant to Section
        7(b)(6) the participant shall be deemed to have earned that proportion
        (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the performance units
        granted to the participants under such award as the number of months of
        the award period in which the participant was not Disabled bears to the
        total number of months of the award period.  The participant's rights
        in any remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

        The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such
        cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.

   (10) Death of Participant.  In the event of the death prior to the end of an
        award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year employment
        requirement with respect to an award prior to the date of death, the
        participant's beneficiaries or estate, as the case may be, shall be
        entitled to a payment of such award upon the end of the award period,
        pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the participant's Performance
        Unit Agreement, provided, however, that the participant shall be deemed
        to have earned that proportion (to the nearest whole unit) of the value
        of the performance units granted to the participant under such award as
        the number of months of the award period which have elapsed since the
        first day of the calendar year in which the award was made to the end
        of the month in which the participant's death occurs, bears to the
        total number of months in the award period.  The participant's rights
        in any remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

        The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such
        cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.

   (11) Grant of Associated Option.  If the Committee determines that the
        conditional grant of performance units under the Plan is to be made to
        a participant in conjunction with the grant of a nonqualified stock
        option under the Plan, the Committee shall grant the participant an
        Associated Option under the Plan subject to the terms and conditions of
        this subsection (11).  In such event, such award under the Plan shall
        be contingent upon the participant's being granted such an Associated
        Option pursuant to which:  (i) the number of shares the optionee may
        purchase shall initially be equal to the number of performance units
        conditionally granted by the award, (ii) such number of shares shall be
        reduced on a one share-for-one unit basis to the extent that the
        Committee determines, pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, to pay to the
        participant or the participant's beneficiaries the performance units

                                    E-2-10
<PAGE>
        conditionally granted pursuant to the award, and (iii) the Associated
        Option shall be cancelable in the discretion of the Committee, without
        the consent of the participant, under the conditions and to the extent
        specified herein and in Section 7(b)(6) hereof.

        If no amount is payable in respect of the conditionally granted
        performance units, the award and such performance units shall be deemed
        to have been canceled, forfeited and surrendered, and the Associated
        Option, if any, shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms.
        If any amount is payable in respect of the performance units and such
        units were granted in conjunction with an Associated Option, the
        Committee shall, within 30 days after the determination of the
        Committee referred to in the first sentence of Section 7(b)(6),
        determine, in its sole discretion, either:

    (A) to cancel in full the Associated Option, in which event the value of
        the performance units payable pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5) and (6)
        shall be paid;

    (B) to cancel in full the performance units, in which event no amount shall
        be paid to the participant in respect thereof but the Associated Option
        shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms; or

    (C) to cancel some, but not all, of the performance units, in which event
        the value of the performance units payable pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5)
        and (6) which have not been canceled shall be paid and the Associated
        Option shall be canceled with respect to that number of shares equal to
        the number of conditionally granted performance units that remain
        payable.

        Any action taken by the Committee pursuant to the preceding sentence
        shall be uniform with respect to all awards having the same award
        period.  If the Committee takes no such action, it shall be deemed to
        have determined to cancel in full the award in accordance with clause
        (B) above.

    8.  Determination of Breach of Conditions:  The determination of the
        Committee as to whether an event has occurred resulting in a forfeiture
        or a termination or reduction of the Company's obligations in
        accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall be conclusive.

    9.  Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock:  In the event of changes in
        the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of stock
        dividends, recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, split-ups,
        combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the aggregate number
        and class of shares available under the Plan, and the number, class and
        the price of shares subject to outstanding options and/or awards and
        the number of performance units and/or the dollar value of each unit
        shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee, whose determination
        shall be conclusive.

    10. Taxes:  In connection with the transfer of shares of Common Stock to an
        optionee, subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as the result of
        the exercise of a nonqualified stock option or a stock appreciation
        right, or to a participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act,
        upon payment of an award, the Company shall have the right to retain or
        sell without notice, or to demand surrender of, shares of Common Stock
        having a Fair Market Value (taking into account any commissions or

                                    E-2-11
<PAGE>
        other expenses the Company may incur upon the sale of such shares) on
        the date that the amount required by any governmental entity to be
        withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect to such transfer
        ("Withholding Tax") is to be determined (the "Tax Date") sufficient to
        cover the amount of any Applicable Tax (the amount of Withholding Tax
        plus the incremental amount determined on the basis of the highest
        marginal tax rate applicable to such optionee or participant, Federal
        Insurance Contribution Act taxes or other governmental impost or levy),
        and to make payment (or to reimburse itself for payment made) to the
        appropriate taxing authority of an amount in cash equal to the amount
        of such Applicable Tax, remitting any balance to the optionee or
        participant.

        An optionee or participant who is not an executive officer of the
        Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be entitled to
        satisfy the obligation to pay any Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax, by
        providing the Company with funds sufficient to enable the Company to
        pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax or by requiring the Company
        to retain or to accept upon delivery thereof by the optionee or
        participant shares of Common Stock sufficient in value (determined in
        accordance with the last sentence of the preceding paragraph), to cover
        the amount of such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.  Each election by
        an optionee or participant to have shares retained or to deliver shares
        for this purpose shall be subject to the following restrictions:  (i)
        the election must be in writing and be made on or prior to the Tax
        Date; (ii) the election must be irrevocable; (iii) the election shall
        be subject to the disapproval of the Committee.

    11. Amendment of the Plan:  The Board of Directors may amend or suspend the
        Plan at any time and from time to time.  No such amendment of the Plan
        may, however, increase the maximum number of shares to be offered under
        options or awards, or change the manner of determining the option
        price, or change the designation of employees or class of employees
        eligible to receive options or awards, or permit the transfer or issue
        of stock before payment therefor in full, or, without the written
        consent of the optionee or participant, alter or impair any option or
        award previously granted under the Plan, Prior Plan or LTPAP.

    12. Amendment of Options Outstanding Under the Prior Plan:  The Prior Plan
        and certain nonqualified options granted and outstanding thereunder are
        hereby amended to provide that any nonqualified option which is
        outstanding on the date this Plan is adopted by a vote of the holders
        of a majority of the shares of the Company's Common Stock and $2.00
        Convertible Preferred Stock present in person or by proxy at a duly
        held shareholders meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of
        all outstanding voting stock is present shall be exercisable in
        accordance with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(b)(9), except that for the
        purpose of such options "Retirement" shall additionally mean
        termination of the employment of an employee after completing 35 years
        of service with the Company or its Subsidiaries.  Furthermore, an
        employee who makes an election to retire under Article 19 of the
        Retirement Income Plan shall have any additional years of age and
        service which are credited under Article 19 of the Retirement Income
        Plan taken into account when determining such employee's age and years
        of service with the Company or its Subsidiaries under this Section 12.
        Such election shall be deemed a Retirement for purposes of this Section
        12 and all other purposes of this Plan.


                                    E-2-12
<PAGE>
    13. Miscellaneous:  By accepting any benefits under the Plan, each optionee
        or participant and each person claiming under or through such optionee
        or participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated
        acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken or
        made to be taken or made under the Plan by the Company, the Board, the
        Committee or any other Committee appointed by the Board.  No
        participant or any person claiming under or through him shall have any
        right or interest, whether vested or otherwise, in the Plan or in any
        option, or stock appreciation right or award thereunder, contingent or
        otherwise, unless and until all of the terms, conditions and provisions
        of the Plan and the Agreement that affect such participant or such
        other person shall have been complied with.  Nothing contained in the
        Plan or in any Agreement shall require the Company to segregate or
        earmark any cash or other property.  Neither the adoption of the Plan
        nor its operation shall in any way affect the rights and powers of the
        Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to dismiss and/or
        discharge any employee at any time.

    14. Term of the Plan:  The Plan shall become effective as of January 1,
        1993 by action of the Board of Directors conditioned on and subject to
        approval of the Plan, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the
        shares of Common Stock and $2.00 Convertible Preferred Stock of the
        Company present in person or by proxy at a duly held shareholders
        meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding
        voting stock is present.  The Plan shall terminate on December 31,
        2002, or at such earlier date as may be determined by the Board of
        Directors.  Termination of the Plan, however, shall not affect the
        rights of optionees under options theretofore granted to them or the
        rights of participants under awards theretofore granted to them, and
        all unexpired options and awards shall continue in force and operation
        after termination of the Plan except as they may lapse or be terminated
        by their own terms and conditions.

           1982 OPTION, RESTRICTED STOCK AND PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN

1.   Definitions.

     The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of the

     administer the Plan.

     "Common Stock" means the Common Stock of the Corporation.

     "Corporation" means Squibb Corporation.

     "Designated Beneficiary" means the person or persons designated in writing
     by a Participant as a legal recipient of any payments due under a
     performance unit award in the event of the Participant's death, or in the
     absence of such designation, the Participant's estate. Such designation
     must be on file with the Committee in order to be effective but, unless
     the Participant has made an irrevocable designation, may be changed from
     time to time by the Participant.

     "Participant" means an employee who has received an award of performance
     units under the Plan.

     "Payment Schedule" means the schedule adopted by the Committee in
     accordance with Paragraph 6 with respect to each Award Cycle to govern
     determination of the Payment Value of a performance unit at the end of
     each Award Cycle in accordance with Paragraph 6.

     "Payment Value" means the value, expressed in dollars, of a performance
     unit at the conclusion of an Award Cycle, determined in accordance with

     the case of fractions of a cent) of the high and low sales prices of the
     Common Stock of the Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange on the day

     Common Stock on that day, the highest asked price therefor on the New York
     Stock Exchange on that day.

2.   Stock Subject to the Plan.

     There are reserved for issuance upon the payment of performance units
     awarded and the exercise of options granted under the Plan 3,500,000
     authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock and for issuance as
     Restricted Stock 200,000 authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock.
     If any option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any
     reason (including, without limitation, by reason of its surrender,


                                    E-3-1
<PAGE>
     pursuant to the provisions of the fourth paragraph of Paragraph 7(b) or
     otherwise, or cancellation, in whole or in part, pursuant to the
     provisions of Paragraph 7(g) or otherwise, or the substitution in place
     thereof of a new option) without having been exercised in full the shares
     subject thereto shall again be available for the purposes of issuance upon
     the payment of performance units awarded and the exercise of options
     granted under the Plan. If Restricted Stock shall become subject to
     forfeiture and be returned to the Corporation pursuant to the provisions
     of Paragraph 8 hereof, such shares shall again be available for the
     purposes of issuance as Restricted Stock under the Plan. In no event shall
     authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock which, under the Plan, are
     authorized to be used in payment of performance unit awards be deemed to
     be unavailable for purposes of the Plan until such shares shall have been
     issued in payment thereof in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph
     6(g).

3.   Administration.

     The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the express
     provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have plenary authority, in its
     discretion, to determine the individuals to whom, and the time or times,
     at which performance units or Restricted Stock shall be awarded and
     options shall be granted (including without limitation whether such
     options shall be Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options or
     a combination thereof as such terms are hereinafter defined) and the
     number of units and/or shares to be covered by each such award or grant,
     provided, however, that in no event shall a Restricted Stock award be made
     to an employee who, at the time of such award is an officer or director of
     the Corporation. In making such determinations, the Committee may take
     into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective
     employees, their present and potential contributions to the Corporation's
     success and such other factors as the Committee in its discretion may deem
     relevant. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee
     shall also have plenary authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe,
     amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to it, to determine the
     terms and provisions of the respective Restricted Stock, performance unit
     and option agreements (which need not be identical) and to make all other
     determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
     The Committee's determinations of the matters referred to in this
     Paragraph 3 shall be conclusive; provided, however, that the Committee of
     the Board administering the Plan shall not have the authority to interpret
     the Plan or to prescribe, amend, or rescind rules and regulations to it
     that are inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan prohibiting (i) the
     acceleration of payments under the Plan, or (ii) the modification of the
     interest rate to be credited under the Plan.

4.   The Committee.

     The Committee shall consist of three or more members of the Board of
     Directors of the Corporation who are not eligible to receive options,
     Restricted Stock or performance units under the Plan.  The Committee shall
     be appointed by the Board of Directors, which may from time to time
     appoint members of the Committee in substitution for members previously
     appointed and may fill vacancies, however caused, in the Committee.  The
     Committee shall select one of its members as its Chairman and shall hold
     its meetings at such times and places as it may determine.  A majority of
     its members shall constitute a quorum.  All determinations of the
     Committee shall be made by not less than a majority of its members. Any

                                    E-3-2
<PAGE>
     decision or determination reduced to writing and signed by all the members
     shall be fully as effective as if it had been made by a majority vote at a
     meeting duly called and held. The Committee may appoint a secretary, shall
     keep minutes of its meetings and shall make such rules and regulations for
     the conduct of its business as it shall deem advisable.

5.   Eligibility.

     Performance units and Restricted Stock may be awarded and options granted
     only to key employees (which term as used herein includes officers) of the
     Corporation and of its present and future subsidiary corporations (herein
     called subsidiaries).  A director of the Corporation or of a subsidiary
     who is not also an employee of the Corporation or of a subsidiary will not
     be eligible to receive a performance unit or Restricted Stock award or an
     option.  Any such employee may receive one or more performance unit awards
     or one or more options or one or more Restricted Stock awards, or a
     combination thereof, as the Committee shall from time to time determine,
     and such determinations may be different as to different employees and may
     vary as to different awards and grants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
     Restricted Stock award may in no event be made to an employee who, at the
     time the award is made, is an officer or director of the Corporation.

6.   Performance Unit Awards.

     (a)  Performance units which are awarded to a Participant shall have a
          Payment Value at the end of the applicable Award Cycle contingent
          upon performance of the Corporation and/or of such Participant's
          subsidiary, division or department over the Award Cycle.  The
          performance measures may include, but shall not be limited to,
          cumulative growth in pre-tax profits, earnings per share, return on
          shareholders' equity or return on capital employed.  Such measures
          may be applied on an absolute basis or relative to industry indices
          and shall be defined in a manner which the Committee shall deem
          appropriate.  For each Award Cycle, the Committee shall establish a
          Payment Schedule based upon the performance measures determined for
          such Award Cycle and the length of such Award Cycle.  If during the
          course of an Award Cycle there should occur, in the opinion of the
          Committee, significant changes in economic conditions or in the
          nature of the operations of the Corporation or subsidiary, division
          or department which the Committee did not foresee in establishing the
          performance measures for such Cycle and which, in the Committee's
          sole judgment have, or are expected to have, a substantial effect on
          the performance of the Corporation or a Participant's subsidiary,
          division or department during such Cycle, the Committee may revise
          the Payment Schedule and performance measures formerly determined by
          it in such manner, as the Committee, in its sole judgment, may deem
          appropriate.

     (b)  In determining the number of performance units to be awarded, the
          Committee shall take into account an employee's responsibility level,
          performance, potential, cash compensation level and such other
          considerations as it deems appropriate.

     (c)  An award of performance units to a Participant shall terminate for
          all purposes if the Participant does not remain, during the Award
          Cycle, continuously in the employ of the Corporation or one of its
          subsidiaries, except in the case of death, disability or retirement
          under the Corporation's pension plan (including early retirement at

                                    E-3-3
<PAGE>
          the request of the Corporation), in which case (and provided that the
          Participant at the time of death, disability or retirement as
          aforesaid, shall have been continuously in the employ of the
          Corporation or one of its subsidiaries during the period commencing
          on the date the award was granted and ending on the first anniversary
          thereof) the Participant will be entitled to payment (such payment to
          be made in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6(d)) of the
          same portion of the Payment Value of the award the Participant would
          otherwise have been paid (such Payment Value, if any, to be
          determined at the conclusion of the applicable Award Cycle in
          accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 6(a) and 6(e)) as the
          portion of the Award Cycle during which the Participant was employed
          bears to the full Award Cycle.  Under particular circumstances the
          Committee may make other determinations with respect to Participants
          whose services do not meet the foregoing requirements, including the
          waiver of any of the requirements of this subparagraph (c) relating
          to periods of employment.

     (d)  Unless the Committee otherwise determines, no payment with respect to
          performance units will be made to a Participant prior to the end of
          such Participant's Award Cycle; provided, however, that if a
          Participant should die during an Award Cycle and the Participant's
          award shall not have been terminated hereunder prior to death, such
          Participant's Designated Beneficiary may elect instead, subject to
          the approval of the Committee, to have the pro rata portion of the
          Payment Value determined by the Committee as of the end of the year
          during which such Participant's death occurred, based upon
          application of the Payment Schedule to the part of the Award Cycle
          which shall have elapsed (for such purpose, the cumulative growth
          rate achieved to the end of the fiscal year in which death occurs
          will be assumed to continue for the Award Cycle), in which event such
          pro rata portion shall be paid in cash or Common Stock, as provided
          in paragraph 6(g), as soon as practicable following such year (or in
          such number of installments as shall have been requested by the
          Participant and approved by the Committee) to such Participant's
          Designated Beneficiary.

     (e)  Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 6(d) in the case of death,
          a Participant's interest in any performance units awarded to the
          Participant shall mature on the last day of the Award Cycle for such
          award.  The Payment Value of a performance unit shall be the dollar
          amount calculated on the basis of the Payment Schedule applicable to
          such Award Cycle.

     (f)  The total amount of Payment Value due a Participant at the conclusion
          of an Award Cycle shall be paid on such date following the conclusion
          of such Award Cycle as the Committee shall designate, except as
          specifically otherwise provided in the Plan; provided, however, that
          the Committee shall have authority, if it deems appropriate, to defer
          payment (in cash or in stock or both in specified percentages) of the
          Payment Value due a Participant if the Participant shall request the
          Committee to do so at any time prior to the 180th day preceding the
          last day of the Award Cycle for such award.  In respect of awards
          made or to be made in one or more deferred installments in cash,
          interest shall be credited semi-annually on each such award at a rate
          to be determined semi-annually by the Committee, but in no event
          shall such rate be less than the average rate on 10-year AAA new
          industrial corporate bonds during each such semi-annual period as

                                    E-3-4
<PAGE>
          calculated on the basis of the average of such rates for each
          calendar week ending during the period January 1 through June 30 and
          July 1 through December 31, provided that awards made during any such
          six-month period shall be credited on the basis of the average rate
          for that period and provided that installments paid during any such
          six-month period shall be credited on the basis of the average rate
          for the next preceding six-month period, in each case adjusted for
          the number of days such award was to be credited.  Unless paid to the
          recipient of such award at the time credited, interest at the
          foregoing rate shall be credited on the interest so credited until so
          paid. The foregoing minimum interest rate for any award that is
          payable in one or more deferred installments under the Plan may not
          be modified without the prior written consent of the Participant.

          Whenever an award is made in one or more deferred installments in
          stock, the Committee may determine that there shall be credited on
          such award an amount equivalent to the dividends which would have
          been paid with respect to such shares of stock if they had been
          issued and outstanding.  Such dividend equivalents shall be credited
          on the dividend record dates until certificates for such shares shall
          have been delivered to the recipient of such award or until such
          earlier date as the Committee may determine.

          Such interest and dividend equivalents shall be paid to the recipient
          of any such award in cash (or in property if the related dividend
          shall have been in property) at such time or times during the
          deferred period of such award or at the same time as the cash or
          shares of stock to which such interest and dividend equivalents
          apply, all as the Committee shall determine.  The Committee may also
          determine that any such dividend equivalents may be used to purchase
          additional shares of outstanding stock (such shares to be valued for
          such purpose at the mean of the high and low sales prices of such
          stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the dividend record date) to
          be added to the shares of stock covered by such award and held
          subject to the same terms and conditions, including provisions
          relating to the payment of amounts equivalent to dividends thereon.

     (g)  Payment of the Payment Value due a Participant shall be made, at the
          election of the Committee as to each Participant, (i) in cash, (ii)
          in shares of Common Stock of the Corporation (to be determined by
          dividing the Payment Value of all matured performance units by the
          average of the high and low sales prices of such stock on the New
          York Stock Exchange during the five trading days immediately
          preceding the date of payment) or (iii) in a combination of cash and
          shares of Common Stock so valued.

     (h)  If the payment of any award shall be deferred until after the
          termination of the employment of the recipient by the Corporation or
          one of its subsidiaries, the cash or stock covered by such award,
          together with any deferred interest or dividend equivalents thereon,
          shall be delivered in not more than 20 annual installments,
          commencing not later than the January 31 after the termination of
          employment (or such other date as the Committee from time to time
          shall determine), all as the Committee may determine. If the payment
          of an award under the Plan is deferred, such payment thereafter may
          be accelerated so that such payment shall be made immediately or at
          such earlier time or in such lesser number of installments, in each
          case as the Committee may from time to time determine, but only with

                                    E-3-5
<PAGE>
          the prior written consent of the Participant.

     (i)  A person to whom any payment in consideration of an award has been
          made (whether or not the same has been deferred) shall not have any
          interest in the cash or stock awarded, or in any interest or dividend
          equivalents credited, until the cash has been paid or the
          certificates for the stock have been delivered, as the case may be,
          in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.

     (j)  In the event of any changes in the outstanding stock of the
          Corporation by reason of stock dividends, stock splits,
          recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges
          of shares, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, liquidations or other
          similar changes in capitalization, or any distribution to
          shareholders other than cash dividends, the Committee shall make such
          adjustments, if any, in the light of the change or distribution as
          the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine to be
          appropriate, (i) in the number of shares of stock covered by any
          award for which certificates have not been delivered and (ii) in any
          dividend equivalents to which deferred awards of stock are entitled.

     (k)  The recipient of a deferred award may file with the Committee a
          designation of a beneficiary or beneficiaries on a form to be
          provided by the Committee, which designation may be changed or
          revoked by the recipient's sole action, provided the change or
          revocation is filed with the Committee on a form provided by it.  In
          the case of the death of the recipient of an award, before or after
          the termination of employment, any unpaid installments of such
          deferred award shall pass to the Designated Beneficiary. Unpaid
          installments of a deferred award shall be paid either in the same
          installments as originally provided or otherwise as the Committee may
          determine in individual cases.

     (l)  The Corporation shall have the right, in lieu of delivering the
          certificate or certificates for any of or all the stock which would
          otherwise be deliverable to the Participant pursuant to this Plan, to
          pay to such Participant on the date on which such certificate or
          certificates would otherwise be deliverable an amount in cash equal
          to the mean of the high and low sales prices of such stock on the New
          York Stock Exchange on such date or dates as may be determined by the
          Committee, but not more than five trading days prior to such date,
          and after withholding or deducting any required amount of tax, all as
          the Committee may determine in individual cases.

7.   Option Grants.

     (a)  The purchase price of the Common Stock under each option granted
          under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee, but shall be not
          less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the time such
          option is granted.  Such fair market value shall be determined by the
          Committee and shall be taken at not less than the mean (rounded to
          the next highest cent in the case of fractions of a cent) of the high
          and low prices of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on
          the date of the grant of the option.

     (b)  The Committee shall be authorized in its discretion to prescribe in
          the option grant the installments, if any, in which an option granted
          under the Plan shall become exercisable, provided that no option

                                    E-3-6
<PAGE>
          shall be exercisable, prior to the first anniversary of the date of
          grant thereof except as provided in Paragraph 7(e) or except as the
          Committee otherwise determines. In no case may an option be exercised
          as to less than 10 shares at any one time (or the remaining shares
          covered by the option if less than 10) during the term of the option.
          The Committee shall also be authorized to establish the manner and
          the effective date of the exercise of an option. The term of each
          option shall be not more than ten years from the date of grant
          thereof, or such shorter period as is prescribed in Paragraphs 7(d)
          and (e). Except as provided in Paragraphs 7(d) and (e), no option may
          be exercised at any time unless the holder thereof is then an
          employee of the Corporation or of a subsidiary.

          Upon exercise, the option price is to be paid in full in cash or, at
          the discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock owned by
          the optionee having a market value on the date of exercise equal to
          the aggregate option price, or, at the discretion of the Committee,
          in a combination of cash and such shares of Common Stock; provided,
          however, that no such payment in shares of Common Stock shall be made
          unless said shares shall have been owned by the optionee for a period
          of at least three months prior to the date of payment.  For purposes
          of this paragraph, the market value of shares of Common Stock
          delivered in payment of the option price shall be the mean between
          the highest and lowest selling prices per share of Common Stock on
          the New York Stock Exchange on the exercise date; if shares of Common
          Stock are not traded on the exercise date, the fair market value on
          such date shall be determined under Treasury Regulation section
          20.2031-2.  For purposes of this paragraph, an optionee can effect
          delivery of shares of Common Stock by delivering certificates for
          such shares to the Corporation, by furnishing the Corporation the
          registration numbers on the certificates for such shares or, if such
          shares are held of record by a nominee for the benefit of the
          optionee, by furnishing the Corporation a notarized statement
          attesting to the number of such shares the optionee intends to be
          delivered.

          On such terms and conditions as shall be approved by the Committee,
          the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries may directly or indirectly
          lend money to any optionee or other person to accomplish the purposes
          of the Plan, including to assist such person to acquire shares of
          Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of options, and separately to
          tend money to any optionee or other lend person to pay taxes with
          respect to any of the transactions contemplated by the Plan.

          In lieu of requiring an optionee to pay cash and/or stock, and
          receive certificates for shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
          upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, as hereinafter
          defined, if the option so provides, the Committee may elect to
          require the optionee to surrender the option to the Corporation for
          cancellation as to all or any portion of the number of shares covered
          by the intended exercise and receive in exchange for such surrender a
          payment, at the election of the Committee, in cash, in shares of
          Common Stock of the Corporation, or a combination of cash and shares
          of Common Stock of the Corporation, equivalent to the appreciated
          value of the shares covered by the option surrendered for
          cancellation.  Such appreciated value shall be the difference between
          the option price of such shares (as adjusted pursuant to Paragraph
          10) and the fair market value of such shares which shall be

                                    E-3-7
<PAGE>
          determined by the Committee and shall be taken at not less than the
          mean of the high and low prices of the Common Stock on the New York
          Stock Exchange on the date on which the optionee's notice of exercise
          is received by the Corporation.  Upon delivery to the Corporation of
          a notice of exercise of option, the Committee may avail itself of its
          right to require the optionee to surrender the option to the
          Corporation for cancellation as to shares covered by such intended
          exercise. The Committee's right of election shall (i) be conditional
          upon its so notifying the optionee in writing immediately on the date
          of the Corporation's receipt of the optionee's notice of exercise and
          (ii) expired, if not exercised, at the close of business on the fifth
          business day following the delivery to the Corporation of such
          notice.  Should the Committee not exercise such right of election,
          the delivery of the aforesaid notice of exercise shall constitute an
          exercise by the optionee of the option to the extent therein set
          forth, and payment for the shares covered by such exercise shall then
          become due.

     (c)  In the event that an individual receiving a Non-Qualified Stock
          Option, as hereinafter defined, shall not remain in the employ of the
          Corporation or of one of its subsidiaries for a period of at least
          one year from the date of grant of the option and the termination of
          such individual's service during such period is either (i) for cause
          or (ii) voluntary on the part of such individual and without the
          written consent of the Corporation or such subsidiary, the option
          shall forthwith terminate on the date of such termination of
          employment.  Retirement at the early or normal retirement date as
          prescribed from time to time by the Corporation shall be deemed to be
          a termination of employment with the Corporation's written consent.
          An individual receiving an Incentive Stock Option, as hereinafter
          defined, may exercise it only after one year of employment following
          the grant date (and then only to the extent provided in the option
          grant) and termination of such employment in such one-year period
          will terminate all rights under such option.

     (d)  In the event of the termination of the employment of the holder of
          any option, other than by reason of normal or early retirement in
          accordance with the provisions of a pension plan of the Corporation
          or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates (hereinafter "Retirement"),
          or death, the optionee may (unless the option shall have been
          previously terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or
          unless otherwise provided in the option grant) exercise the option at
          any time within three months after such termination, but not after
          the expiration of the option, to the extent of the number of shares
          covered by the option which were purchasable by the optionee at the
          date of the termination of employment.

          In the event of the termination of the employment of the holder of
          any option because of Retirement before May 5, 1987, the optionee,
          may (unless the options shall have been previously terminated
          pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise
          provided in the option grant) exercise the option at any time during
          the remaining term of the option but not after the expiration of the
          option, to the extent of the number of shares covered by the option
          which were purchasable by the optionee at the date of termination of
          employment.

          In the event of the termination of the employment of the holder of

                                    E-3-8
<PAGE>
          any option because of Retirement on or after May 5, 1987, the option
          shall (unless the option shall have been previously terminated
          pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise
          provided in the option grant) continue to become exercisable in
          accordance with its terms and the provisions of this Paragraph 7 and
          of the option grant, and the holder thereof may exercise the option
          at any time and from time to time during the remaining term thereof,
          but not after the expiration of the option, to the extent it is at
          such time exercisable; provided, however, that if the holder becomes
          employed by a direct competitor of the Corporation or any of its
          subsidiaries, any option held by the optionee which is not, on the
          date of becoming so employed, fully exercisable shall forthwith
          terminate as to all shares not then purchasable by such optionee
          thereunder, and, thereafter, such optionee may so exercise the option
          only to the extent of the number of shares covered by the option
          which were purchased by such optionee at the date of employment by
          such direct competitor.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof but subject to the
          provisions of Paragraph 7(c), the Committee may determine, in its
          sole discretion, in the case of any termination of employment that
          the holder of an option may exercise such option to the extent of the
          remaining shares covered thereby whether or not such shares had
          become purchasable by such an individual at the date of the
          termination of employment. Options granted under the Plan shall not
          be affected by any change of employment so long as the holder
          continues to be an employee of the Corporation or of a subsidiary.
          The option grant may contain such provisions as the Committee may
          approve with reference to the effect of approved leaves of absence.
          Nothing in the Plan or in any option granted pursuant to the Plan
          shall confer on any individual any right to continue in the employ of
          the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or interfere in any way
          with the right of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to
          terminate his employment at any time.

     (e)  In the event of the death of an individual to whom an option has been
          granted under the Plan while such individual is employed by the
          Corporation or a subsidiary, the option theretofore granted (unless
          the option shall have been previously terminated pursuant to the
          provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise provided in the
          option grant) may be exercised by a legatee or legatees of the option
          holder under the optionee's last will or by the personal
          representatives or distributees of the optionee, (i) if such
          individual's death occurs prior to May 5, 1987, at any time within a
          period of one year after death or (ii) if such individual's death
          occurs on or after May 5, 1987, during the remaining term of the
          option, but in neither event after the expiration of the option, to
          the extent of the remaining shares covered by the option whether or
          not such shares had become purchasable by such an individual at the
          date of death.

          In the event of the death of an individual during the three-month
          period following the termination of employment (where said
          termination was for reasons other than Retirement), the option (if
          not previously terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph
          7(c) or unless otherwise provided in the option grant) may be
          exercised by a legatee or legatees of the option holder under the
          optionee's last will or by the optionee's personal representatives or

                                    E-3-9
<PAGE>
          distributees but only to the extent of the number of shares
          purchasable by such employee pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph
          7(d) at the date of termination of the optionee's employment and
          within one year after the date of the death, but not after expiration
          of the option.

          In the event that an individual to whom an option has been granted
          under the Plan dies following Retirement, the option theretofore
          granted to such individual (if not previously terminated pursuant to
          the provisions of Paragraph 7(c) or unless otherwise provided in the
          option grant) may be exercised by a legatee or legatees of the option
          holder under the optionee's last will, or by the optionee's personal
          representatives or distributees, at any time during the remaining
          term of the option, but not after expiration of the option, (i) if
          Retirement commenced prior to May 5, 1987, only to the extent of the
          number of shares purchasable by such individual pursuant to the
          provisions of Paragraph 7(d) at the date of termination of employment
          or (ii) if Retirement commenced on or after May 5, 1987, to the
          extent of the number of shares covered by the option whether or not
          such shares had become purchasable by such individual at the date of
          death, subject, however, to the limitations described in Paragraph
          7(1).

     (f)  Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 7(h), the date of grant of an
          option pursuant to the Plan shall be the date specified by the
          Committee at the time it grants such option, provided that such date
          shall not be prior to the date of such action by the Committee. The
          Committee shall promptly notify a grantee of an award and a written
          option grant shall promptly be duly executed and delivered by or on
          behalf of the Corporation.

     (g)  The Committee shall be authorized, in its absolute discretion, to
          permit optionees to surrender outstanding options in exchange for the
          grant of new options or require optionees to surrender outstanding
          options as a condition precedent to the grant of new options.  The
          number of shares covered by the new options, the option price, the
          option period and other terms and conditions of the new options shall
          all be determined in accordance with the Plan and may be different
          from the provisions of the surrendered options.  However, if an
          Incentive Stock Option is surrendered, it will nevertheless be
          considered outstanding for purposes of Paragraph 7(h).

     (h)  Each option granted or modified hereunder which is intended to be an
          Incentive Stock Option (when used herein, the term "Incentive Stock
          Option" shall be as defined in Section 422A of the United States
          Internal Revenue Code and all other options granted hereunder are
          referred to as "Non-Qualified Stock Options") shall not be
          exercisable while there is outstanding any Incentive Stock Option
          which was granted, before the granting of such option, to the
          optionee to purchase stock in the optionee's employer corporation or
          in a corporation which (at the time of the granting of such option)
          is a parent or subsidiary of the employer corporation, or is a
          predecessor of any of such corporations.  For purposes of this
          Paragraph 7(h), an Incentive Stock Option shall be treated as
          outstanding until such option is exercised in full or expires by
          reason of lapse of time.  In the case of an option which is modified
          and which did not meet the requirements applicable to Incentive Stock
          Options prior to such modifications but does thereafter, the date of

                                    E-3-10
<PAGE>
          such modification shall be treated as the date of grant for purposes
          of this Paragraph 7(h). In determining whether any Incentive Stock
          Option is exercisable at the time of an optionee's retirement, the
          restrictions on order of exercise set forth in this Paragraph 7(h)
          shall be disregarded, but such restrictions shall continue to apply
          with respect to the order in which such options may be exercised.

     (i)  In no event shall any optionee be granted during the calendar year
          1982 or any subsequent year an Incentive Stock Option or Incentive
          Stock Options entitling such optionee to purchase stock of the
          Corporation, any parent corporation or any subsidiaries of the
          Corporation, having an aggregate fair market value (determined as of
          the time such option or options are granted) in excess of $100,000
          plus the amount of any unused limit carryover to such calendar year.
          In the case of any option which is modified and which did not meet
          the requirements applicable to Incentive Stock Options prior to such
          modification but does thereafter, the date of such modification shall
          be treated as the date of grant for purposes of this Paragraph 7(i).
          Eligibility of an optionee for any unused limit carryover to any year
          and the amount thereof shall be determined in accordance with
          applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

8.   Restricted Stock Awards.

     (a)  The consideration to be received for shares of Restricted Stock
          issued hereunder out of authorized but unissued shares shall be equal
          to cash in an amount equal to the par value thereof and the continued
          employment by the participant during the "Restricted Period" (as
          hereafter defined).  The recipient of Restricted Stock shall be
          recorded as a stockholder of the Corporation and shall have, subject
          to the provisions hereof, all the rights of a stockholder with
          respect to such shares and receive all dividends or other
          distributions made or paid with respect to such shares; provided that
          the shares themselves and any new, additional or different shares or
          securities which the recipient may be entitled to receive with
          respect to such shares by virtue of a stock split or stock dividend
          or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the
          Corporation, shall be subject to the restrictions hereinafter
          described.

     (b)  During a period of years following the date of grant, as determined
          by the Committee, which shall in no event be less than four
          (hereinafter referred to as the "Restricted Period"), the Restricted
          Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated
          or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the recipient, except in
          the event of (i) death as hereinafter provided or (ii) the transfer
          thereof to the Corporation under the provisions of the next
          succeeding paragraph.  In the event of the death of the recipient
          during the said Restricted Period, the aforesaid restrictions on the
          Restricted Stock shall immediately lapse and the legal
          representative(s) of the estate of the recipient shall be free to
          transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock.

          In the event that, during the Restricted Period, the employment of
          the recipient by the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries is
          terminated for any reason (including termination with or without
          cause by the Corporation or such subsidiary, resignation by the
          recipient, or retirement under a pension plan of the Corporation or

                                    E-3-11
<PAGE>
          one of its subsidiaries), other than termination of employment due to
          the death of the recipient, then the shares of Restricted Stock held
          by such recipient shall be forfeited to the Corporation and the
          recipient shall immediately transfer and return to the Corporation
          the certificates representing all the Restricted Stock and the
          recipient's rights as a stockholder with respect to the Restricted
          Stock shall cease, effective with such termination of employment.

          The recipient's rights to the Restricted Stock may not be assigned or
          transferred except by will or by the laws of descent or distribution.
          In the event of any attempt to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge or
          otherwise dispose of said shares by the recipient in violation of the
          provisions hereof, such shares shall be forfeited to the Corporation.

     (c)  The Committee shall have authority, if it deems appropriate, to
          extend the Restricted Period with respect to any award of Restricted
          Stock if the recipient shall request the Committee to do so at any
          time prior to the 180th day preceding the date on which the
          Restricted Period is originally scheduled to lapse.  In the event
          that the Restricted Period is so extended (the "Extended Restricted
          Period") until after the termination of the employment of the
          recipient by the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries, the
          restrictions on the Restricted Stock shall lapse in not more than
          twenty annual installments, commencing not later than the January 31
          after the termination of employment (or such other date as the
          Committee from time to time shall determine), all as the Committee
          may determine.  If the Restricted Period is so extended, such lapsing
          of restrictions thereafter may be accelerated so that all such
          restrictions shall lapse immediately or at such earlier time or in
          such less number of installments, in each case as the Committee may
          from time to time determine, but only with the prior written consent
          of the recipient.  In the event of the death of the recipient during
          the Extended Restricted Period, all restrictions on the Restricted
          Stock shall immediately lapse and the legal representative(s) of the
          estate of the recipient shall be free to transfer, encumber or
          otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock.

9.   Transferability and Shareholder Rights of Holders of Performance Units and
     Options.

     No performance unit awarded and no option granted under the Plan shall be
     transferable otherwise than pursuant to Paragraph 6(k) or by will or by
     the laws of descent and distribution, and an option may be exercised,
     during the lifetime of the holder thereof, only by such holder.  The
     holder of a performance unit award or of an option shall have none of the
     rights of a shareholder until (i) in the case of performance unit awards,
     the recipient has an interest therein in accordance with Paragraph 6(i),
     or (ii) in the case of options, the shares subject thereto shall have been
     registered in the name of the person or persons exercising such option on
     the transfer books of the Corporation upon such exercise.

10.  Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization.

     Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, the option grants may
     contain such provisions as the Committee may determine as appropriate for
     the adjustment of the number and class of shares subject to the options
     and the option prices of the options covered thereby, in the event of

                                    E-3-12
<PAGE>
     changes in the outstanding Common Stock by reason of stock dividends,
     stock splits, recapitalizations, merger & consolidations, combinations, or
     exchanges of shares, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, liquidations or
     other similar changes in capitalization, or any distribution to common
     shareholders other than cash dividends, and, in the event of any such
     change in the outstanding Common Stock, the aggregate number and class of
     shares available under the Plan and the maximum number of shares as to
     which options may be granted and performance units awarded and the maximum
     number of shares of Restricted Stock which may be awarded shall be
     appropriately adjusted by the Committee.

11.  Amendment and Termination.

     Unless the Plan shall theretofore have been terminated as hereinafter
     provided, the Plan shall terminate on, and no awards of Performance Units
     or Restricted Stock or options shall be made after, December 31, 1987, and
     provided further that the said Plan termination shall have no effect on
     awards of Performance Units or Restricted Stock or options made prior
     thereto. The Plan may be terminated, modified or amended by the
     stockholders of the Corporation.  The Board of Directors of the
     Corporation may also terminate the Plan, or modify or amend the Plan in
     such respects as it shall deem advisable in order to conform to any change
     in any law or regulation applicable thereto, or in other respects which
     shall not change (i) the total number of shares as to which options may be
     granted or which may be used in payment of performance unit awards under
     the Plan or which may be issued as Restricted Stock, (ii) the class of
     employees eligible to receive awards of performance units, Restricted
     Stock and options, (iii) the manner of determining the Unit Base Value and
     minimum option prices, (iv) the period during which awards of performance
     units or Restricted Stock may be made or options may be granted or
     exercised, (v) the minimum period of four years set forth in Paragraph
     8(b), (vi) the provisions relating to the administration of the Plan by a
     Committee consisting of directors of the Corporation not eligible to
     participate in the Plan; provided further that, with respect to awards
     previously granted under the Plan, the Board of Directors shall not have
     the authority to modify or amend the provisions of the Plan prohibiting
     (i) the acceleration of payments under the Plan, or (ii) the modification
     of the interest rate to be credited under the Plan.

12.  Withholding

     In connection with the transfer of shares of Common Stock as a result of
     the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, the payment of performance
     units or the payment of a Restricted Stock Award, the Corporation shall

     of, shares of Common Stock in value sufficient to cover the amount of any
     Withholding Tax (that is, that portion of any Applicable Tax, as defined
     below, required by any governmental entity to be withheld or otherwise
     deducted and paid with respect to such reimburse itself for payment made)
     to the transfer), and to make payment (or to reimburse itself for payment
     made) to the appropriate taxing authority of an amount in cash equal to
     the amount of such Withholding Tax, remitting any balance to the employee.
     For purposes of this paragraph, the value of shares of Common Stock so
     retained or surrendered shall be the average of the high and low sales
     prices per share on the New York Stock Exchange on the date that the
     amount of the Withholding Tax is to be determined (the "Tax Date"), and
     the value of shares of Common Stock so sold shall be the actual net sale
     price per share (after deduction of commissions) received by the

                                    E-3-13
<PAGE>
     Corporation.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employee shall be entitled to satisfy
     the obligation to pay any Withholding Tax (or, if the employee is an
     officer of the Corporation within the meaning of Section 16 of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Section 16"), to satisfy the obligation
     to pay any tax to any governmental entity in respect of such transfer,
     including any Federal, state or local income tax up to an amount
     determined on the basis of the highest marginal tax rate applicable to
     such employee, Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes or other
     governmental impost or levy (an "Applicable Tax")), in whole or in part,
     by providing the Corporation with funds sufficient to enable the
     Corporation to pay such Withholding Tax (or Applicable Tax) or by
     requiring the Corporation to retain or to accept upon delivery thereof by
     the employee shares of Common Stock sufficient in value (determined in
     accordance with the last sentence of the preceding paragraph) to cover the
     amount of such Withholding Tax (or Applicable Tax).  Each election by an
     employee to have shares retained or to deliver shares for this purpose
     shall be subject to the following restrictions:  (i) the election must be

     be irrevocable; (iii) the election shall be subject to the disapproval of
     the Committee; (iv) if the employee is an officer of the Corporation
     within the meaning of Section 16, the election may not be made within six
     months of the grant of the related stock option or the award of the
     related performance units or Restricted Stock (except that this
     restriction shall not apply in the event the death or disability of the
     employee occurs within six months of such grant or award); and (v) if the
     employee is an officer of the Corporation within the meaning of Section
     16, the election must be made at least six months prior to the Tax Date or
     in any ten-business day "window period" (beginning on the third business
     day following the date on which the Corporation releases for publication
     its annual or quarterly statements of sales and earnings and ending on the
     twelfth business days following the date of release thereof) prior to the
     Tax Date.

13.  Effectiveness of the Plan.

     The Plan shall become effective on the date of its adoption by the Board
     of Directors of the Corporation and performance unit and Restricted Stock
     awards may be made and options granted immediately thereafter, but no
     performance unit award may be paid or Restricted Stock issued or option
     exercised under the Plan unless and until the Plan shall have been
     approved by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
     shares of Common Stock at a meeting of the shareholders within twelve
     months after the date of adoption of the Plan by the Board of Directors.
     If such approval is not obtained within said period, the Plan and any
     awards made or options granted under the Plan shall be null and void.  The
     Committee may in its discretion authorize the awarding of performance
     units and Restricted Stock and the granting of options, the payment,
     issuance of exercise of which, respectively, shall be expressly subject to
     the conditions that (i) the shares of Common Stock reserved for issue
     under the Plan shall have been duly listed, upon official notice of
     issuance, upon each stock exchange in the United States upon which the
     Common Stock is traded and (ii) a registration statement under the
     Securities Act of 1933 with respect to such shares shall have become
     effective.

                                      of

                         BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
                AND ITS SUBSIDIARY OR AFFILIATED CORPORATIONS
              PARTICIPATING IN THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
                          RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN OR
                 THE BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB PUERTO RICO, INC.
                            RETIREMENT INCOME PLAN


          (as amended and restated effective as of January 1, 1993,
          ---------------------------------------------------------
                      and as amended to October 1, 1993)
                      ----------------------------------

I.   Purpose of the Plan
     -------------------
     The purpose of this Plan is to provide benefits for certain employees
     participating in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan
     (the "Retirement Income Plan") or the Bristol-Myers Squibb Puerto Rico,
     Inc. Retirement Income Plan (the "Puerto Rico Plan") (referred to herein
     collectively as the "Retirement Plans") whose funded benefits under the
     Retirement Plans are or will be limited by application of the Employee
     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and the
     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  The Plan is
     intended to be an "excess benefit plan" as that term is defined in Section
     3(36) of ERISA with respect to those participants whose benefits under the
     Retirement Plans have been limited by Section 415 of the Code, and a "top
     hat" plan meeting the requirements of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3),
     401(a)(1) and 4021(b)(6) of ERISA with respect to those participants whose
     benefits under the Retirement Plans have been limited by Section
     401(a)(17) of the Code and with respect to certain employees covered by
     the Squibb Corporation Supplementary Pension Plan (the "Squibb Plan") on
     December 31, 1990.  This Plan is a continuation and successor plan to the
     Benefit Equalization Plan of Bristol-Myers Company and Its Subsidiary and
     Affiliated Corporations Participating in the Bristol-Myers Company
     Retirement Income Plan and the Bristol-Myers Company Savings and
     Investment Program, as in effect on January 1, 1983 and as amended
     thereafter (the "Prior Plan").  All amounts accrued under Part IV of the
     Prior Plan continue to be accrued under this Plan.

     Effective as of January 1, 1991, the Plan assumed the liabilities for all
     benefits payable under the Squibb Plan with respect to all active and
     former employees (other than foreign employees) which had accrued as of
     December 31, 1990, with respect to benefits provided under the Squibb Plan
     other than benefits due to a Squibb employee's election to defer an annual
     incentive award or benefits payable to foreign employees of Squibb.
     Therefore, this Plan is a continuation and successor plan to the Squibb
     Plan with respect to all such benefits accrued thereunder prior to
     January 1, 1991 with respect to employees who participated in the Squibb
     Corporation Pension Plan.  Employees who were participants in the Squibb
     Plan who accrue benefits under this Plan on or after January 1, 1991,
     shall be entitled to the benefits provided by this Plan with respect to
     all service covered under either the Retirement Income Plan or the Puerto
     Rico Plan.

II.  Administration of the Plan
     --------------------------
     The Pension Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of
     Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Company") to administer
     the Retirement Plans shall also administer this Plan.  The Committee shall
     have full authority to determine all questions arising in connection with
     the Plan, including its interpretation, may adopt procedural rules, and
     may employ and rely on such legal counsel, such actuaries, such
     accountants and such agents as it may deem advisable to assist in the
     administration of the Plan.  Decisions of the Committee shall be
     conclusive and binding on all persons.

III. Participation in the Plan
     -------------------------
     Each member of the Retirement Income Plan or the Puerto Rico Plan who is
     employed by a corporation participating in either Retirement Plan
     (hereinafter referred to as a "participating employer" which term also
     includes the Company) shall be eligible to participate in this Plan
     whenever (a) his benefit under the applicable Retirement Plan, as from
     time to time in effect, would exceed the limitations on benefits and
     contributions imposed by Section 415 of the Code calculated from and after
     September 2, 1974, (b) amounts of his compensation would be excluded from
     his "Final Average Compensation" determined under the Retirement Plan by
     reason of the application of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code or (c) he
     participates in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Performance Incentive
     Plan (the "Performance Incentive Plan").

IV.  Equalization Benefits Related to the Retirement Plan
     ----------------------------------------------------
     A.   Each participant in this Plan or his beneficiaries shall be entitled
          to receive under this Plan a supplemental pension benefit equal to
          the excess of (1) the benefit that would have been payable to such
          participant or his beneficiaries under the applicable Retirement Plan
          determined (a) without regard for any provision therein incorporating
          limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Code, and (b) by deeming as
          "compensation" for purposes of determining Final Average Compensation
          under such Retirement Plan amounts elected to be deferred under the
          Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings and Investment Program ("Savings
          and Investment Program") but which due to Section 415 limitations
          were, in accordance with the participant's election, credited to the
          Benefit Equalization Plan of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and Its
          Subsidiary or Affiliated Corporations Participating in the
          Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings and Investment Program (the
          "Savings and Investment BEP"), over (2) the actual benefit payable to
          such participant or his beneficiaries under the applicable Retirement
          Plan.

     B.   Each participant whose compensation under the applicable Retirement
          Plan is limited by Section 401(a)(17) of the Code or who participates
          in the Performance Incentive Plan shall be entitled to receive an
          additional supplemental pension benefit under this Plan equal to the
          amount, if any, by which the supplemental pension benefit determined
          under paragraph A of this Article IV would be greater if the
          hypothetical benefit calculated under clause (1) of such paragraph
          were determined (a) by disregarding, in addition to Section 415
          limitations, any limitations on such participant's Final Average
          Compensation imposed by reason of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (b)
          by including in his "annual rate of compensation" for purposes of

                                    E-6-2
<PAGE>
          determining Final Average Compensation under such Retirement Plan
          amounts elected to be deferred under the Savings and Investment
          Program but, due to Section 401(a)(17) limitations, were, in
          accordance with such participant's election, credited to the Savings
          and Investment BEP and (c) by recalculating his "annual rate of
          compensation" for each year used in determining Final Average
          Compensation under such Retirement Plan, by substituting for the cash
          award paid under the Performance Incentive Plan during such calendar
          year the cash award earned by such participant under the Performance
          Incentive Plan for such calendar year.  For purposes of clause (c) of
          the preceding sentence, any performance incentive award for the
          calendar year in which the participant retires or otherwise
          terminates employment shall be assumed to be fully earned as though
          all performance goals and other conditions to full payment had been
          attained as of such retirement or termination date.

     C.   The supplemental pension benefits determined under paragraphs A and B
          of this Article IV shall be calculated utilizing the same actuarial
          assumptions used to compute the participant's Retirement Plan benefit
          payments or such other assumptions as may be determined by the
          Committee from time to time and shall be payable to the participant
          (or his beneficiary) upon his election:

     (i)  in the case of a participant who is a Member of the Retirement Income
          Plan who elects between October 1, 1993 and December 30, 1993,
          inclusive, to retire under Article 19 of the Retirement Income Plan,
          the supplemental pension benefits determined under paragraphs A and B
          of this Article IV shall be payable to the participant (or his
          beneficiary) in the same form as the participant's benefit under the
          Retirement Income Plan is payable (utilizing the same actuarial
          assumptions used to compute the participant's Retirement Income Plan
          benefit payments or such other assumptions as may be determined by
          the Committee from time to time), commencing within 60 days after the
          earlier of (a) his retirement entitling him to receive payments under
          the Retirement Income Plan, (b) his death, (c) his total disability
          as defined in the Retirement Income Plan, or (d) if the participant's
          employment terminates prior to the date he is entitled to receive
          payments under the Retirement Income Plan, the date he attains his
          Early Retirement Date under the Retirement Income Plan; or

     (ii) in the case of all other participants,

     (a)  in either the lifetime benefit, 50% joint and survivor, 100% joint
          and survivor, or the Variable Retirement Income annuity forms of
          payment as provided under the applicable Retirement Plan, commencing
          within 60 days after the earlier of (1) his retirement entitling him
          to receive payments under the applicable Retirement Plan, (2) his
          death, (3) his total disability as defined in the applicable
          Retirement Plan, or (4) if the participant's employment terminates
          prior to the date he is entitled to receive payments under the
          applicable Retirement Plan, the date he attains his Early Retirement
          Date under such Retirement Plan.  Such election shall be made, in
          writing, concurrent with the participant's benefit election under the
          applicable Retirement Plan and shall become irrevocable as of the
          retirement date; or

     (b)  in a lump sum provided that one year prior to retirement, the
          participant irrevocably elects, in writing, to receive supplemental

                                    E-6-3
<PAGE>
          pension benefits in such form, which payment shall be made within 60
          days after his retirement entitling him to receive payments under the
          applicable Retirement Plan, except that, in the case of a participant
          who is eligible to retire under the applicable Retirement Plan who
          has an involuntary termination or unplanned retirement and who
          irrevocably elects, in writing, 90 days prior to retirement to
          receive supplemental pension benefits in such form, such payment
          shall be made on the first anniversary of his retirement.

     Any other provision of this Article IV to the contrary notwithstanding, if
     upon a participant's termination of employment or retirement the present
     value of the amount of the supplemental pension benefits determined under
     paragraphs A and B of this Article IV is not more than $3,500 (or if
     payments would be less than $50 per month), such benefit shall be paid in
     cash to the participant in a single sum at the time of such termination or
     retirement.

     Each participant's supplemental pension benefits under this Plan shall be
     paid by his participating employer.  If the participant was employed by
     more than one such participating employer, the proportion to be paid by
     each such participating employer shall be in the ratio which the "Credited
     Service" (as defined in the applicable Retirement Plan) of the participant
     with a participating employer bears to the total "Credited Service" of
     such participant with all participating employers.

V.   Designation of Beneficiaries in the Event of Death
     --------------------------------------------------
     Upon the death of a participant prior to receipt of all or part of the
     amount on his account, the balance remaining on his account shall be paid
     as follows:  If the participant has designated a joint annuitant or
     beneficiary under the applicable Retirement Plan, such person shall be
     deemed the joint annuitant or beneficiary for purposes of this Plan.  If
     the participant has not designated a joint annuitant or beneficiary under
     such Retirement Plan, or if no such joint annuitant or beneficiary is
     living at the time of the participant's death, the amount in the
     participant's account that is distributable upon his death shall be
     distributed to the same person or persons who would otherwise be entitled
     to receive a distribution of the participant's Retirement Plan benefits.
     Payment to one or more of such persons shall completely discharge the Plan
     with respect to the amount so paid.

VI.  Miscellaneous
     -------------
     This Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board of Directors of the
     Company, in which event the rights of participants to their accrued
     supplemental pension benefits under this Plan shall become
     non-forfeitable.  The Company or any participating employer may terminate
     this Plan with respect to its employees participating in the Retirement
     Plans, in which event the rights of participants to their accrued
     supplemental pension benefits under this Plan and payable by such
     terminating corporation shall become non-forfeitable.

     If the Plan is terminated, no distribution shall be made to a participant
     or beneficiary which is attributable to the termination during the 90 day
     period following such termination.  Thereafter, providing the Company is
     not subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, all amounts then
     accrued on behalf of a participant shall be distributed to him (or his
     beneficiary) within 60 days after the end of such 90-day period.  If the

                                    E-6-4
<PAGE>
     Company is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, distribution
     of such amounts shall be suspended subject to the pendency of such
     proceeding.

     No right to payment or any other interest under this Plan may be
     alienated, sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or made subject to
     attachment, execution, or levy of any kind.

     Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as giving any employee the right
     to be retained in the employ of any participating employer.  Each
     participating employer in the Plan expressly reserves the right to dismiss
     any employee at any time without regard to the effect which such dismissal
     might have upon him under the Plan.

     This Plan may be amended at any time by the Board of Directors of the
     Company, except that no such amendment shall deprive any participant of
     his supplemental pension benefit accrued at the time of such amendment.
     To the extent that a grantor trust is established by the Company, the
     Committee may from time to time reserve unto itself the right to vote any
     shares of equity securities held in a Pension Trust Fund or may permit
     such other committee, or Investment Manager or Managers as it may
     designate to exercise such responsibility.

     Benefits payable under this Plan shall not be funded and shall be made out
     of the general funds of the participating employers or any grantor trust
     established for this purpose.  The participating employers shall not be
     required to segregate any contributions made by participants under this
     Plan.  They shall become a part of the general funds of the participating
     employers.

     This Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced according to the
     substantive internal laws (and not the conflict of laws provisions) of the
     State of New York.

VII. Effective Date
     --------------
     This amended and restated Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 1993,
     for retirements or other terminations of employment on and after such
     date, upon its adoption by the Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb
     Company.

     Common Stock sufficient in value (determined in accordance with the last
     sentence of the preceding paragraph) to cover the amount of such
     Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax or in a Page Two of Amendment to
     Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 1989 Restricted Stock Award Plan.  greater
