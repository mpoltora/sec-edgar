SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
- -----------------------------------------

Bristol-Myers Squibb, for the most part, purchases the principal raw materials
and supplies used in each industry segment in the open market.  Substantially
all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of
any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.


PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
- --------------------------------

The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United States
and foreign countries covering products, principally in the medicines
and medical devices segments, and has also developed many brand
names and trademarks for products in each industry segment.  The Company
considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights
to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.
The Company believes that no single patent or license is of material
importance in relation to the business as a whole.

COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
- ---------------------------------------

The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad based,
heavily competitive and include many competitors.  The principal means of
competition utilized to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include
quality, service, price and product performance.  The pharmaceutical products
of the medicines segment and the products of the medical devices segment are
promoted on a national and international basis in medical journals and
directly to the medical profession.  The Company is also utilizing
direct-to-consumer advertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products.
Most of the other products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised
and promoted on a national and international basis through the use of
television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window and in-store
displays.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's products are principally sold to the
wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally.  Certain
products of the medicines and medical devices segments are also sold to other
drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession.  None of the
segments is dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, such that
the loss of any one or more would have a material adverse effect on the
segment.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------

Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's businesses,
particularly to the Medicines Segment.  Management continues to emphasize
leadership, innovation and productivity as strategies for success in the
Research Institute. Pharmaceutical research and development is carried out
by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute which has
major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey; and
Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development is also
carried out at various other facilities in the United States and in Belgium,
France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,577 million in 1998, $1,385 million in 1997 and
$1,276 million in 1996 on Company sponsored research and development
activities.  Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage
of pharmaceutical sales, was 12.4% in 1998 compared to 12.0% in 1997 and 12.3%
in 1996.


REGULATION
- ----------

Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of
government regulation in the countries in which its operations are
conducted.  The Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory
requirements applying to its products and operations. For some products,
and in some countries, government regulation is significant and, in general,
there is a trend to more stringent regulation.  The Company devotes
significant time, effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental
regulatory requirements applicable to its business.  Governmental regulatory
actions can result in the recall or seizure of products, suspension or
revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product,
and other civil and criminal sanctions.

In the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic, food and cosmetic
industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation
by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to product
manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.  Assuring compliance
with appropriate laws and regulations requires increasing expenditures of time
and resources.

In addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other
countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in
some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate
drug utilization.  Government regulation in these areas already exists in some
countries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other
countries in the future.

While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may
be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its
substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and
restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development of
new and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within this
environment.

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

Reference is made to Note 16 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K Annual
Report.

The Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
(MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in a number
of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various
types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related
company.  Of the more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against the
Company in direct lawsuits or through registration in the national class
action Revised Settlement Program (described below), most have been dealt with
through the Revised Settlement, other settlements, or trial.  As of January 1,
1999, the Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims
was limited to residual unpaid Revised Settlement Program obligations and to
roughly 6,000 remaining opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims
in court.

As of December 31, 1998, approximately 15,000 United States and 1,300 foreign
breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and
state courts in the United States and in certain courts in Canada and
Australia.  These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are in the
process of being settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about 10,200
U.S. and 400 foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement.  The
lawsuits of the 4,800 U.S. plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected to be
dismissed since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000 women with MEC
implants who chose to participate in the nationwide settlement.  Of the
remaining opt-out plaintiffs, some have claims based upon products that were
not manufactured and sold by MEC; many others have claims that are in the
process of being settled.  Under the terms of the Revised Settlement Program,
additional opt-outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for U.S.
class members to opt out has passed.  In addition, the Company's remaining
obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are limited because most
payments to "Current Claimants" (see below) have already been made, no
additional "Current Claims" may be filed without court approval, and payments
of claims to so-called "Other Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited
by the terms of the Revised Settlement Program.  The Company believes it will
be able to address remaining opt-out claims as well as expected remaining
obligations under the Revised Settlement Program within its reserves
described below.

                               9
<PAGE>

Breast implants were manufactured by several companies, including MEC, which
the Company acquired in 1982. Until 1991, MEC manufactured two types of breast
implants, polyurethane-covered silicone breast implants and smooth-walled
silicone breast implants.  In these lawsuits, plaintiffs typically contend
that silicone in breast implants causes systemic disease and/or local
complications.  Some plaintiffs with polyurethane-covered silicone breast
implants contend that the polyurethane component causes injury, including
cancer.  Most of the disease claims involve non-specific complaints such as
chronic fatigue, aches and pains and other symptoms that commonly affect the
population at large.  Many women claim local complications such as rupture,
hardening or contracture, and disfigurement or scarring.  The plaintiffs
typically seek compensatory damages for alleged medical conditions and
emotional distress as well as punitive damages.  The defendants have based
their defense in part on the lack of credible scientific evidence that breast
implants cause disease.  Many large scale epidemiological studies have found
no connection between breast implants and the alleged diseases.  Defendants
also contend that warnings set forth in the product literature adequately
advised physicians and surgeons of the risks of local complications.

The Company is a participant in the national class action Revised Settlement
Program approved on December 22, 1995, by the Honorable Sam C. Pointer, Jr.,
Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama (Lindsey, et al., v. Dow Corning, et al., CV-94-P-11558-S), before
whom all federal breast implant cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes.
The Revised Settlement arises out of the class action settlement approved by
the Court on September 1, 1994.  All appeals from the Order approving the
Revised Settlement have been dismissed.  On January 16, 1996, the Company,
Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter International (collectively, Baxter),
and Minnesota, Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) (hereinafter, the
Settling Defendants) each paid $125 million into a court-established fund as
an initial reserve to pay claims under the Revised Settlement.  The Company
has made and will make additional contributions to the court-established fund.

The fifteen-year Revised Settlement provides benefits to those U.S. breast
implant recipients who have had at least one breast implant manufactured by
one of the Settling Defendants (or their related companies).  Several kinds
of benefits are available for eligible participants with breast implants made
by companies affiliated with the Company, Baxter and 3M:  (1) for Current
Claimants, compensation generally ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 based on
disease and disability definitions of the original settlement, plus
supplemental benefits of an additional $15,000 to $50,000 for claimants with
ruptured implants; (2) for Current Claimants seeking higher benefits and for
Other and Late Registrants, compensation ranging from $75,000 to $250,000
based on more stringent disease and disability definitions (Long-Term
Benefits); and (3) although the Settling Defendants are not recommending
removal of implants absent some specific medical reason, a $3,000 payment for
those class members (other than Late Registrants) who seek removal of implants.
Current Claimants are eligible for an advance payment of $5,000, and Other
Registrants are eligible for an advance payment of $1,000.  Other Registrants
who receive their $1,000 advance payment by June 15, 1999, are eligible for
an additional $2,500 payment if they relinquish their rights to further
benefits under the Revised Settlement and provide a full release of their
breast implant claims.  For Current Claimants, benefits are payable regardless
of the number of claimants seeking compensation, and regardless of the total
dollar value of approved claims.  For Other and Late Registrants, benefits are
subject to an aggregate $725 million limit for the three Settling Defendants
over the fifteen-year life of the program.  The Company's individual aggregate
limit for such benefits is $400 million.  In the event the dollar value of the
claims subject to the limit were to exceed this amount, claimants may be
afforded additional opt-out rights but without the right to assert punitive or
other statutory multiple damage claims.  The Company's obligations to make
payments under the Revised Settlement are not affected by the number of class
members electing to opt out of the settlement or the number of class members
making claims under it except to the extent of the above-mentioned dollar
limits.


                                     10
<PAGE>

In addition to individual suits and the Lindsey class action, the Company
continues as a defendant, together with other defendants, in two other class
action proceedings.  On April 11, 1996, a class action on behalf of all women
in the Canadian province of British Columbia was certified in the provincial
court of British Columbia on the single issue of whether silicone gel breast
implants are reasonably fit for their intended purpose (Harrington v. Dow
Corning Corporation et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, C954330).  Also,
there is an action pending on behalf of children allegedly exposed to silicone
in utero and through breast milk (Feuer, et al., v. McGhan, et al., U.S.D.C.,
E.D.N.Y., 93-0146), which has not been certified as a class action, and which
names all breast implant manufacturers as defendants and seeks to establish a
medical monitoring fund.

The Company entered into several other settlements of breast implant-related
claims.  In July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million
(U.S. funds) class action settlement with plaintiff representatives in the
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.  The class includes persons who have or had
MEC breast implants and who reside in Ontario and Quebec or who received their
MEC implants there.  The settlement, which had minimal opt-outs, has been
approved by the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec.  In May of 1996, the
Company, together with other Settling Defendants in the Revised Settlement
Program, entered into a $50 million settlement of claims asserted by certain
health insurers based upon payments made or benefits provided by insurers and
represented health plans to participating registrants that allegedly involve
or relate to silicone gel breast implants.  The Company has contributed $22.5
million to the settlement, which extinguishes the potential claims of the
majority of the U.S. commercial and non-governmental health care insurer
market against both the defendants and settlement class members.  In November
1996, the benefits of the Revised Settlement were extended, with certain
modifications, to foreign breast implant recipients.  Pursuant to this
settlement, the Settling Defendants paid (on an equal basis) an aggregate of
$25 million into a court-approved settlement fund as an initial reserve for
payment of foreign claims.

The Company's insurers were notified of the breast implant claims and the
Revised Settlement, and a number reserved their rights or declined coverage.
The Company reached settlement with many of these insurers in connection with
coverage litigation filed by it in state court in Texas.  In 1993, the Company
offset its breast implant product liability special charges by $1.0 billion of
expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance Recoverable). The Company
now believes that it will obtain additional amounts of insurance proceeds
above that amount and has recorded an additional Insurance Recoverable in the
fourth quarter of 1998 of approximately $100 million.

While there have been a few large judgments, defendants have won more trials
than they have lost, and the Company's trial experience has been mostly
favorable.  The Company has maintained throughout this litigation that breast
implants do not cause disease, and medical and scientific data support the
Company's position.  The Company's view has found support in the trial courts.
Courts in several states have ruled to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs'
experts concerning a causal link between silicone gel breast implants and
systemic illness on the ground that it fails to satisfy standards for
reliability under current U.S. Supreme Court guidelines.  A national science
panel of four independent experts appointed by Judge Pointer has recently
issued its unanimous report, based on a comprehensive review of the medical
and scientific literature, that there is no evidence linking silicone breast
implants and systemic disease.  The Company intends to dispose of the claims
of remaining opt-outs by continuing to implement its plan to settle cases at
values it deems acceptable, and to wage a vigorous defense, including taking
cases to trial, of those cases that do not settle at such values.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million
before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.
The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,
offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters
of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750
million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes
($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product
liability claims.  In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded an
additional special charge to earnings in the amount of $800 million before
taxes and increased its insurance receivable in the amount of $100 million,
resulting in a net charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect
of breast implant product liability claims.

Infant Formula Matters
- ----------------------

The Company, one of its subsidiaries, and others have been defendants in a
number of antitrust actions in various states filed on behalf of purported
statewide classes of indirect purchasers of infant formula products and by
the Attorneys General of Louisiana, Minnesota and Mississippi, alleging a
price fixing conspiracy and other violations of state antitrust or deceptive
trade practice laws and seeking penalties and other relief.  The Company has
resolved all of these cases, except for a private action in Louisiana.  On
November 6, 1997, the court in Louisiana dismissed the plaintiffs' case.  The
plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit. The Company believes that this action is without merit and
that its ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

As of December 31, 1998, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains and
independent drugstores, suing individually.  These cases, which have been
coordinated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, seek treble damages and injunctive relief on
account of an alleged antitrust conspiracy concerning the pricing and
marketing of brand name prescription drugs in violation of the Sherman Act
and also assert claims of unlawful price discrimination under the Robinson-
Patman Act.  The Company and a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers
previously settled a class action case brought against it and other
pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers that made similar claims under
the Sherman Act and has also settled claims brought by some of the in
dividual plaintiffs who opted out of the retailer class action.  On August 4,
1998, the court denied motions made in the individual retailer cases by
manufacturer defendants, including the Company, for partial summary judgment
dismissing the plaintiffs' Sherman Act damage claims to the extent based on
purchases from wholesalers that occurred more than four years prior to
November 20, 1997, when the court permitted those plaintiffs to amend their
complaints to name wholesalers as defendants.  On December 15, 1998, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit declined to accept an
interlocutory appeal from the ruling denying partial summary judgment.  A
trial in the class action case against the manufacturer and wholesaler
defendants who had not settled the class action commenced on September 14,
1998, and ended on November 30, 1998, when the court granted the defendants'
motion for a directed verdict.  The class plaintiffs have appealed from that
ruling.  Cases brought by retail pharmacies in state court under state law
alleging similar grounds are pending in Alabama, California and Mississippi.
Settlements of cases brought as class actions in state court on behalf of
consumers in those states have received final approval in Arizona, the
District of Columbia, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New York,
North Carolina and Wisconsin; settlements of such cases are subject to final
court approval in California and Tennessee.  A purported class action on
behalf of consumers in Alabama and eight other states that was brought in
state court in Alabama against the Company and other pharmaceutical
manufacturers remains pending; on December 29, 1998, activity in that case
was stayed pending resolution of certain appeals, including an appeal in the
Alabama retailer case, by the Supreme Court of Alabama.  On June 16, 1998, a
purported class action on behalf of consumers in Tennessee and 12 other states
was filed in state court in Tennessee against the Company and other
pharmaceutical manufacturers.  On July 6, 1998, a class consisting of
consumers in Tennessee and the other states was conditionally certified,
without notice to the defendants.  By order dated November 13, 1998, the court
in that action denied the defendants' motion to vacate the conditional class
certification and also stayed all further proceedings pending further order of
the court.  On March 9, 1999, a purported class action on behalf of consumers
in North Dakota was brought in state court in North Dakota against the Company
and other pharmaceutical manufacturers.  In the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Company recorded a special charge to earnings in the amount of $100 million
before taxes ($62 million after taxes) in respect of prescription drug
litigation.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------


The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in,
a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency or
comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or comparable state laws
directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.  While it is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, the Company believes
that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or
consolidated financial position.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Summary

In 1998, Bristol-Myers Squibb achieved record levels of sales, with all four
of the Company's business segments reporting sales increases, excluding the
effects of foreign exchange and divestitures. Worldwide sales grew to $18.3
billion, a 9% increase over 1997.  Domestic sales, which represent 61% of
worldwide sales, increased 15% to $11.1 billion, while international sales
increased 2% to $7.2 billion.  Sales growth resulted from a 10% increase due
to volume and a 2% increase from changes in selling prices.  Exchange rate
fluctuations had an unfavorable effect of 3% on worldwide sales and 7% on
international sales, primarily due to Asian and Latin American currencies.

In 1998, the Company's most important products, most of which experienced
double-digit sales increases on a worldwide basis, made significant
contributions to the Company's sales growth.  Two products, PRAVACHOL* and
TAXOL*(R) (paclitaxel), exceeded $1 billion in sales for 1998.  An additional
seven products exceeded over a half billion dollars in annual sales.  By the
end of 1998, Bristol-Myers Squibb had 64 product lines with more than $50
million in annual sales, 36 of which had more than $100 million in annual
sales.

Earnings before income taxes, excluding the 1998 special charge, increased 13%
to $5.1 billion in 1998.  Net earnings, on this basis, increased 13% to $3.6
billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.83 and
$1.79, respectively.  Net earnings and diluted earnings per share, excluding
special charges, have both increased at a compound annual growth rate of 10%
over the past five years.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong.  At December 31,
1998, the Company held $2.5 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable
securities.  Cash provided by operating activities reached an all time high
of $4.1 billion.  Returns to shareholders included dividend distributions of
$1.6 billion and treasury stock repurchases of $1.6 billion.  Dividends per
common share were $.78 in 1998, increasing from $.76 per share paid in 1997.
The Company's payout ratio was 43%, 47% and 53% of net income in 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively, excluding the 1998 special charge.  In December 1998,
the Company announced another dividend increase, the 27th consecutive year
that dividends have increased.  The 1999 indicated annual payment is $.86 per
share, a 10% increase over 1998.  Bristol-Myers Squibb's strong financial
position is evidenced further by its triple-A credit rating from both Moody's
and Standard & Poor's, making Bristol-Myers Squibb one of only eight U.S.
industrial companies with this distinction.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's priorities over the past five years have been focused
on growth, productivity and a dynamic operating culture.  In 1997, the Company
established a long-term strategic objective to be the number one company in
earnings per share growth year after year within its competitive universe.
To help achieve this objective, the Company is making strategic investments
behind a number of high priority projects.  During the year, progress was made
in a number of areas in these projects, including:


                                 22

<PAGE>

    * All goals for pharmaceutical research and development were exceeded.
      Eleven major regulatory approvals were obtained and nine major dossiers
      were filed during the year.
    * PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-lowering agent, was shown to provide
      additional cardiovascular benefits in addition to the established
      reduction in deaths from coronary heart disease and the risk of heart
      attacks.
    * TAXOL*, the Company's leading anti-cancer agent, received a new
      indication in combination with cisplatin for first-line ovarian cancer.
    * GLUCOPHAGE, the leading branded oral medication for treatment of
      non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes, was shown to have an excellent
      therapeutic efficacy profile in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is
      the leader in the U.S. Oral Anti-diabetic market.
    * HERBAL ESSENCES* became number two in the U.S. shampoo/conditioner
      category after only three years on the market.
    * The Company's productivity for growth program contributed more than $600
      million in incremental benefits.


Total equity market capitalization was $133 billion as of December 31, 1998,
a 42% increase over last year.  1997 equity market capitalization was $94
billion, an increase of 72% over 1996.  Total return to stockholders, share
price appreciation together with reinvested dividends, was 43.0% for 1998,
77.0% for 1997 and 32.1% for 1996.  The 1998 return compares favorably to the
28.6% return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.


On December 1, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split of the common stock of the Company, effective February 1999.
This is the second stock split in the past two years.  The Board of Directors
also recommended that an amendment be considered for stockholder approval at
the annual meeting of stockholders to increase the number of authorized shares
of common stock from 2.25 billion to 4.5 billion. All share and per share
information presented herein has been adjusted for the effect of the stock
split.

Net Sales and Earnings

Worldwide sales increased 9% in 1998 to $18.3 billion, compared with increases
of 11% and 9% in 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The consolidated sales growth
resulted from a 10% increase due to volume, a 3% decrease due to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations and a 2% increase due to changes in selling prices.
In 1997, the 11% increase in sales reflected a 14% increase due to volume, a
3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and no changes overall
from pricing activity.  In 1996, the 9% increase in sales reflected an 11%
increase due to volume, a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and no changes overall from pricing activity. Domestic sales
increased 15% in 1998, 14% in 1997 and 10% in 1996, while international sales
increased 2% in 1998 (9% excluding foreign exchange), 7% in 1997 (15%
excluding foreign exchange) and 9% in 1996 (13% excluding foreign exchange).
In general, the businesses of the Company's industry segments are not seasonal.

As described in Notes 2 and 16 to the financial statements, the Company has
determined the final cost of its breast implant product liability (related to
a previously discontinued business of a subsidiary) and the cost of litigation
for prescription drug pricing cases.  Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of
1998, the Company recorded a special charge of $800 million before taxes, $495
million after taxes, or $.24 per diluted share, to augment the reserve for
breast implant liability and for the prescription drug pricing litigation,
offset by expected insurance recoveries.  The breast implant component of the
charge is $700 million before taxes ($800 million of liability offset by
insurance receivables of $100 million), and the prescription drug pricing
component is $100 million before taxes.  As a result of the special charge,
1998 net earnings were $3,141 million, basic earnings per share were $1.58
and diluted earnings per share were $1.55.


                                23

<PAGE>

Net earnings, excluding the special charge, were $3,636 million, a 13%
increase over the prior year.  Basic earnings per share were $1.83 and diluted
earnings per share were $1.79, both increasing 14% over 1997.  In 1997, net
earnings of $3,205 million increased 12% from $2,850 million in 1996.  Basic
and diluted earnings per share of $1.61 and $1.57, respectively, increased 13%
and 12%, from $1.42 and $1.40, respectively, in 1996.  Net earnings margins,
excluding the special charge, increased to 19.9% in 1998 from 19.2% in 1997
and 18.9% in 1996.

The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 28.3% in
1998, excluding the special charge, compared to 28.5% and 29.0% in 1997 and
1996, respectively.  The effective income tax rate has decreased since 1996
due to increased income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.

As described in Note 4 to the financial statements, in 1998 the Company
completed the acquisition of Redmond Products, Inc., a leading hair care
manufacturer in the United States.  The Company also, in 1998, acquired
Phytoervas, a line of premium retail hair care products in Brazil, and Dong-A
Biotech Co., Ltd., a marketer and distributor of pharmaceutical products in
South Korea.  In 1997, the Company acquired Abeefe S.A., Peru's largest
pharmaceutical manufacturer and marketer.  The Company also, in 1997, acquired
CHOCO MILK*, Mexico's leading milk-based nutritional supplement, and
SAL DE UVAS PICOT*, a leading effervescent antacid product in Mexico.
In 1996, the Company acquired Pharmavit, one of Hungary's leading
manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, nutritional products and generic
pharmaceuticals.  The Company also, in 1996, acquired Argentia S.A., one of
Argentina's largest manufacturers and marketers of ethical pharmaceuticals,
and completed the acquisition of Oncology Therapeutics Network, a
specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products.

As described in Note 4 to the financial statements, in the first quarter of
1998, the Company divested its BAN brand of anti-perspirants and deodorants.
In the second quarter of 1998, the Company divested A/S GEA, a Denmark-based
generic drug business, and Hexachimie, a specialty chemical manufacturer based
in France.  In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company divested Linvatec
Corporation, its arthroscopy and surgical powered instrument business.
These divestitures resulted in gains before taxes of $201 million in 1998
and $225 million in 1997.

The Company recorded restructuring charges of $201 million in 1998 and $225
million in 1997.  These restructuring charges consist primarily of asset
write-downs and employee-related costs related to the consolidation and
closure of plants and facilities.


Expenses

Total costs and expenses as a percentage of sales, excluding the special
charge, were 72.3% in 1998 compared with 73.2% in 1997 and 73.4% in 1996.

As a percentage of sales, cost of products sold remained relatively unchanged
at 26.6% in 1998 compared to 26.7% in 1997.  In 1997, cost of products sold
as a percentage of sales increased to 26.7% from 26.3% in 1996, principally
due to incremental lower margin Oncology Therapeutics Network sales,
partially offset by increased sales of higher margin promoted pharmaceutical
products.

Following a 15% increase in advertising and promotion expenses in 1997 due
to product launches and direct-to-consumer campaigns for our high priority
pharmaceutical products, 1998 expenses increased 3% to $2,312 million from
$2,241 million.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,
decreased to 24.2% in 1998 from 25.0% in 1997 and 26.1% in 1996.  This
decreasing trend is a direct result of the Company's productivity programs
partially offset by increases in pharmaceutical sales force personnel.

The Company's investment in research and development totaled $1,577 million
in 1998, an increase of 14% over 1997, and as a percentage of sales,
increased to 8.6% in 1998 from 8.3% in 1997.  This spending level reflects
the Company's commitment to research over a broad range of therapeutic areas
and to clinical development in support of new products. Over the past 10
years, research and development expenses have increased at a compound annual
growth rate of 9%.  In 1998, research and development spending dedicated to
the research and development of pharmaceutical products increased 16%, and
was 12.4% of pharmaceutical sales compared to 12.0% and 12.3% in 1997 and
1996, respectively.  In 1998, the Company initiated filings with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for ORZEL, the first oral agent for colorectal
cancer in the U.S., and TEQUIN, a broad-spectrum oral quinolone antibiotic.
Additional filings are expected in 1999 for omapatrilat, a novel
antihypertensive.  During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company entered into a
number of research alliances, licensing agreements and biotechnology
collaborations.  These agreements are providing important new products,
early-stage compounds for further development and new processes that will help
the Company screen for new drugs more effectively.

Business Segments

All four of the Company's business segments - Medicines, Nutritionals, Medical
Devices and Beauty Care - reported sales increases, excluding foreign exchange
and divestitures, during the year.

Sales in the Medicines Segment (Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Medicines), which
is the Company's largest segment at 69% of the total Company, increased 12%
to $12,573 million in 1998.  Sales growth resulted from a 13% increase due to
volume and a 2% increase from selling prices, offset by a 3% decrease due to
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Domestic sales increased
20% and international sales increased 8%, excluding foreign exchange,
primarily due to volume growth.

Sales of PRAVACHOL*, the Company's largest-selling product, were $1.6 billion,
an increase of 14%. Domestic sales increased 17% to $1,022 million.  In
November 1998, results from the landmark LIPID trial were published in the
New England Journal of Medicine showing that PRAVACHOL* improved total
mortality, improved results for patients with unstable angina and reduced
total hospitalizations. In July 1998, additional findings of the Cholesterol
and Recurrent Events (CARE) Trial were published in the Journal of the
American College of Cardiology, demonstrating cardiovascular protection in
women, the subgroup studied, as well as for a broad range of patients.  In
June 1998, the FDA cleared enhanced drug interaction labeling for PRAVACHOL*,
for reduced potential to interact with some commonly prescribed medications.
In March 1998, the FDA cleared PRAVACHOL* for use in reducing the risk of
stroke in patients who have had a heart attack and have normal cholesterol
levels. PRAVACHOL* is the only drug of its type indicated to reduce the risk
of a heart attack in patients with and without established coronary heart
disease.  Sales of MONOPRIL*, a second generation angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with once-a-day dosing, increased 16% to $380 million,
with strong growth in both domestic and international markets and strong
acceptance among managed care organizations in the United States.  Products
from the Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi S.A. joint venture, AVAPRO and
PLAVIX, were launched in the fourth quarter of 1997 and first quarter of
1998, respectively. PLAVIX, a platelet aggregation inhibitor for the reduction
of stroke, heart attack and vascular death in atherosclerotic patients,
reached sales of $144 million for the year, and AVAPRO, an angiotensin II
receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, had sales of $120 million.
Sales of cardiovascular drugs, the largest product group in the Medicines
segment, increased 11% to $3,210 million.  Due to the loss of patent
exclusivity in several European countries in the first quarter of 1997, and
in the United States in February 1996, sales of captopril, an ACE inhibitor
sold primarily under the trademark CAPOTEN*, declined 20% to $636 million.
Excluding CAPOTEN* sales, cardiovascular drug sales increased 22%.

                            25

Sales of anti-cancer drugs increased 21% to $2,925 million.  Sales of TAXOL*
increased 28% to $1,206 million. In September 1998, the FDA approved
Genentech Inc.'s product, Herceptin(R), as a first-line therapy in combination
with TAXOL* for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.  Also
in September, the European Community approved a TAXOL* indication for
non-small cell lung cancer.  In May 1998, a U.S.-based cooperative group
study, sponsored under the Bristol-Myers Squibb Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement with the National Cancer Institute, showed that by
adding TAXOL* to a regimen with other commonly used chemotherapy drugs, the
risk of death for women with early-stage breast cancer was reduced by 26%.
This study, which enrolled over 3,000 women, was the first to show such a
significant survival benefit in early-stage breast cancer in over 20 years.
In April 1998, TAXOL*, in combination with cisplatin, was approved by the FDA
for first line treatment of ovarian cancer.  Sales of PARAPLATIN*, which is
used in combination therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 20%
to $525 million.  Sales by the Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN) were $657
million.

Anti-infective drug sales were $2,412 million, an increase of 8% over the
prior year.  Sales of ZERIT*, an antiretroviral agent, increased 38% to $551
million, and sales of VIDEX* grew 7% to $162 million.  ZERIT* is the most
commonly prescribed thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in
HIV therapy in the United States.  In June 1998, the Company announced a large
phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing of
VIDEX*, as Bristol-Myers Squibb seeks to develop a more convenient dosing
regimen for HIV patients.  Sales of CEFZIL*, an oral cephalosporin used in
the treatment of respiratory infections and sinusitis, and MAXIPIME*, a fourth
generation injectable cephalosporin, also contributed to the growth of
anti-infectives.

Sales of central nervous system drugs increased 15% to $1,099 million, due
to the strong growth of BUSPAR*, the Company's novel anti-anxiety agent, and
SERZONE*, an antidepressant.  Sales of BUSPAR* increased 20% to $531 million,
while sales of SERZONE* increased 39% to $257 million.

GLUCOPHAGE continued to experience strong growth, with sales increasing 49%
to $861 million.  In September 1998, results of the United Kingdom Prospective
Diabetes Study demonstrated the excellent therapeutic efficacy profile of
GLUCOPHAGE in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Sales of EXCEDRIN* increased 17% to $241 million following clearance by the
FDA in January 1998 to market EXCEDRIN* Migraine, the first and only
non-prescription medication approved for relief of migraine pain.

In 1997, Medicines Segment sales increased 14% over 1996 levels.  Increases in
sales of PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PARAPLATIN*, ZERIT*, MONOPRIL*, BUSPAR*, CEFZIL*,
GLUCOPHAGE, SERZONE*, VIDEX* and volume growth of EFFERALGAN* and ASPIRINE
UPSA* from the UPSA Group were partially offset by decreases in sales of
CAPOTEN*.

The margin on earnings before taxes decreased slightly to 27.8% in 1998 from
27.9% in 1997, as increases, as a percentage of sales, in research and
development expenditures and sales force expenditures were offset
by decreases in advertising and promotional spending and general
administrative expenses, In 1997, the margin on earnings before taxes
decreased to 27.9% from 28.0% in 1996 due to increased investment in
advertising and promotion expenses in support of high priority products and
lower margin sales for OTN.

Sales in the Medical Devices Segment, excluding the December 1997 divestiture
of Zimmer's arthroscopy and surgical powered instrument business, increased 7%
over prior year levels to $1,647 million, reflecting a 10% increase due to
volume, a 3% decrease due the effect of foreign exchange and no effect from
selling prices.  Domestic sales increased 9% and international sales increased
6% (11% excluding the effect of foreign exchange).  Including the divestiture,
Medical Device sales decreased 9%. The Company's ConvaTec division is the
worldwide market share leader in ostomy and advanced wound care products.
Sales of ostomy and wound care products increased 5% and 9%, respectively,
excluding foreign exchange.  Worldwide sales of knee prosthetic joint implants
increased 1% and hip replacement sales decreased 2%, excluding the effect of
foreign exchange.

In 1997, worldwide sales of Medical Devices decreased 3%, an increase of
1% excluding foreign exchange.

The margin on earnings before taxes in the Medical Devices Segment improved
to 20.5% in 1998, from 19.5% in 1997 due to decreases, as a percentage of
sales, in other marketing and general administrative expenses, partially
offset by increases in cost of products sold due to higher costs for products
sold under a distribution agreement with the acquirer of Linvatec.  The
margin on earnings before taxes in the Medical Devices Segment decreased to
19.5% in 1997 from 22.5% in 1996, due to incremental manufacturing costs in
connection with recently introduced products.

Sales in the Nutritionals Segment decreased 2% to $1,759 million, reflecting
a 2% increase due to volume, a 6% decrease due to the effect of foreign
exchange rate fluctuations primarily in Asia and a 2% increase due to changes
in selling prices.   International sales decreased 7% (an increase of 7%
excluding the effect of foreign exchange), and domestic sales increased 2%.
Mead Johnson continues to be the leader in the worldwide and U.S. infant
formula markets.  Total infant formula sales decreased 1% to $1,203 million
(an increase of 2% excluding foreign exchange).  Sales of ENFAMIL*, the
Company's largest selling infant formula, decreased 3% to $649 million
worldwide (a decrease of 1% excluding foreign exchange).  Gains were recorded
for NUTRAMIGEN* and LACTO FREE* specialty infant formulas.  BOOST*, an adult
nutritional beverage, and CHOCO MILK*, a milk-based nutritional supplement
acquired in July 1997, also contributed to sales growth.

In 1997, worldwide sales of Nutritionals increased 6% from 1996 levels,
primarily due to growth of NUTRAMIGEN*, LACTO FREE* and PROSOBEE* specialty
infant formulas, and adult consumer nutritionals.

The margin on earnings before taxes improved to 21.4% in 1998 from 20.6% in
1997, primarily due to a decrease, as a percentage of sales, in cost of
products sold, resulting from improved manufacturing efficiencies and
productivity programs. The margin on earnings before taxes in the Nutritionals
Segment decreased to 20.6% in 1997 from 21.1% in 1996.

                             27

Sales in the Beauty Care Segment increased 22% in 1998 to $2,305 million,
reflecting a 22% increase due to volume, a 3% increase due to pricing and a
3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Excluding the effect
of foreign exchange, international sales increased 26% over 1997, while
domestic sales increased 25%. The Company's Clairol division continues to be
the number one hair products company in the United States.  Sales of the
Company's hair care products were especially strong, increasing 49% in 1998,
primarily due to sales of the HERBAL ESSENCES* complete line of shampoos,
conditioners, styling aids and body wash, which increased 60% to $561 million.
HERBAL ESSENCES* is the number two brand in the total shampoo and conditioner
market in the U.S. after only three years on the market, and number three in
body wash after less than two years on the market.  The Redmond AUSSIE* brand,
acquired in January 1998, has added more than $100 million in sales for the
year. DAILY DEFENSE* and VITAL NUTRIENTS*, both launched in September 1997,
contributed $82 million and $34 million, respectively, in sales for the year.
Haircoloring product sales increased 6%, benefiting from the continued success
of HYDRIENCE*, NATURAL INSTINCTS*, salon haircolorings and the launch of
REVITALIQUE*, a new premium permanent haircolor.

In 1997, sales in the Beauty Care Segment increased 14% from 1996 levels,
primarily due to increased sales of hair care products, led by HERBAL
ESSENCES*.

The margin on earnings before taxes in 1998 improved to 15.7% from 14.8%
in 1997 and 14.4% in 1996, primarily due to higher volumes and manufacturing
efficiencies due to productivity programs, partially offset by investment
spending behind new product introductions.

Geographic Areas

Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in
the world; its largest markets are the United States, France, Japan,
Germany and Canada.

Sales in the U.S., net of inter-area sales, increased 15% in 1998.
Sales in the Medicines and Beauty Care Segments, comprised 68% and 15%,
respectively, of the region's sales.  Products with strong growth in the
region included GLUCOPHAGE, TAXOL*, PRAVACHOL*, HERBAL ESSENCES*, BUSPAR*,
PARAPLATIN*, and initial sales of PLAVIX and AUSSIE* hair care products.
The margin on earnings before taxes increased to 26.2% in 1998 from 24.5% in
1997 primarily due to decreases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of products
sold, advertising and general administrative expenses. In 1997, sales in
the U.S. increased 14%, net of inter-area sales, primarily due to anti-cancer
and anti-infective drugs from the Medicines Segment, specialty infant formulas
from the Nutritionals Segment and hair care products from the Beauty Care
Segment. The margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 24.5% in 1997 from
26.0% in 1996 primarily due to increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost
of products sold and advertising and promotion expenses.

Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased
4% (6% excluding foreign exchange). Medicines Segment comprise nearly 77%
of sales in the region.  Products with strong growth in the region included
TAXOL*, ZERIT*, PRAVACHOL*, HERBAL ESSENCES* and initial sales of AVAPRO.
Increases in sales of these products were partially offset by decreases in
sales of CAPOTEN* of $104 million due to the loss of exclusivity in several
European countries in early 1997.  The margin on earnings before taxes
decreased to 23.4% in 1998 from 23.8% in 1997 primarily due to increases,
as a percentage of sales, in promotional expenses.  In 1997, sales in Europe,
Mid-East and Africa, net of inter-area sales, increased 2% (12% excluding
foreign exchange), due to sales growth of products from the Medicines Segment
including anti-cancer, antiretroviral and analgesic products, and the
introductions of HERBAL ESSENCES* and HYDRIENCE* from the Beauty Care segment.
These increases were partially offset by decreases in sales of CAPOTEN* due
to loss of exclusivity.  The margin on earnings before taxes increased to
23.8% in 1997 from 21.9% in 1996 due to manufacturing efficiencies as a result
of the Company's productivity programs.

                            28
<PAGE>

Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,
increased 11% in 1998 (20% excluding foreign exchange).  Medicines and Beauty
Care Segments comprised nearly 62% and 18%, respectively, of the region's
sales.  Products with strong growth included HERBAL ESSENCES* and CHOCO MILK*,
due to their recent introductions into the region.  The margin on earnings
before taxes decreased to 12.8% in 1998 from 14.2% in 1997 reflecting
increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of products sold.  In 1997,
sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries, net of inter-area sales,
increased 25% (26% excluding foreign exchange), due to increased sales of
cardiovascular, anti-cancer and anti-infective drugs from the Medicines
Segment, introductory sales of HYDRIENCE* and HERBAL ESSENCES* from the Beauty
Care Segment, and sales from the acquisitions of CHOCO MILK* and SAL DE UVAS
PICOT*.  The margin on earnings before taxes increased to 14.2% in 1997 from
11.1% in 1996, reflecting improved gross margins due to manufacturing
efficiencies.

Sales in the Pacific region increased 5% in 1998, net of inter-area sales
and excluding the effect of foreign exchange.  Including foreign exchange,
sales decreased 11% primarily due to currency fluctuations in Japan, the
Philippines, Thailand and Australia and economic downturns in the region.
Medicines and Nutritionals Segments comprised 45% and 22%, respectively, of
the region's sales.  Increases in TAXOL* and HERBAL ESSENCES* (launched in
the region in 1997) were offset in part by decreases in infant formulas and
CAPOTEN*, which lost patent exclusivity in Japan in 1997.  As a result of
economic downturns and unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates, earnings
before taxes in the Pacific region were minimal in 1998.  In 1997, sales in
the Pacific region, net of inter-area sales, increased 5% (13% excluding
foreign exchange), as a result of increased sales from pharmaceuticals, skin
care products, infant formulas and the launch of HERBAL ESSENCES*.  The
margin on earnings before taxes decreased to 3.2% in 1997 from 4.4% in 1996,
primarily as a result of increases, as a percentage of sales, in cost of
products sold and sales force expenses.

Financial Instruments


Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled
$2.5 billion at December 31, 1998, compared to $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Working capital was $3.0 billion
at December 31, 1998, compared to $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents, time
deposits and marketable securities, and the conversion of other working
capital items are expected to fund near-term operations of the Company.

The Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in currency exchange
rates and interest rates.  To reduce these risks, the Company enters into
certain derivative financial instruments where available on a cost-effective
basis to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are
managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take
advantage of any natural offsets.

It is the Company's policy to hedge certain underlying economic exposures to
reduce foreign exchange and interest rate risk.  Derivative financial
instruments are not used for trading purposes.  Gains and losses on hedging
transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being
hedged.

                                    29
<PAGE>

Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts
are used to hedge anticipated transactions.  The Company's primary foreign
currency exposures in relation to the U.S. dollar are the French franc,
Deutsche mark and Japanese yen.

The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option
contracts as of December 31, 1998.  The fair value of option contracts,
which will change over time, is estimated based on forward currency rates
and other relevant market factors.  The fair value of option contracts
should be viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged
transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 31, 1997, the Company held right to sell option contracts with an
aggregate notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $1,035 million,
$17 million and $48 million, respectively.  These contracts primarily related
to option contracts with the right to sell French francs and Deutsche marks.
The Company also held right to buy option contracts, primarily to buy Japanese
yen for U.S. dollars and Japanese yen for Deutsche marks, with an aggregate
notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $244 million, $5 million
and $7 million, respectively.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable
securities with various financial institutions.  These financial institutions
are located primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and Company policy is designed
to limit exposure to any one financial institution.

Recently Issued Accounting Standard

On June 15, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
(FAS 133), which becomes effective for financial statements beginning
January 1, 2000.  FAS 133 requires that companies recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these
instruments at fair value. The Company is currently evaluating this statement
and its impact on the Company's existing accounting policies and financial
reporting disclosures.

                                  30

Year 2000

The Company has reviewed its information systems for Year 2000 compliance.
The Year 2000 problem arises because many computer systems use only two
digits to represent the year. These programs may not process dates beyond
1999, which may cause miscalculations or system failures.

The Company has a comprehensive compliance program to assess the Year 2000
problem in the processing of data in the Company's information technology
(IT) and non-IT systems, including manufacturing, and research and
development systems. With regard to IT systems, this program has been
implemented, and the assessment as well as the required corrective actions
and testing are substantially complete. With regard to the critical
manufacturing, and research and development systems, the assessment has been
completed, with corrective actions and testing to be substantially completed
by mid-year 1999.

In connection with this compliance program, the Company also has asked
critically important vendors, customers, suppliers, governmental regulatory
authorities and financial institutions, whose incomplete or untimely
resolution of the Year 2000 problem could potentially have a significant
impact on the Company's operations, to assess their Year 2000 readiness.
This assessment has been substantially completed.

Contingency plans are being prepared, where necessary, to minimize any
significant exposures from the failures of these third parties to be Year
2000 compliant. These plans will be substantially completed by mid-year 1999,
and include development of backup procedures, identification of alternate
suppliers, and possible increases in inventory levels.

The Company does not expect the Year 2000 problem, as well as the cost of
the compliance program, to have a material impact on the Company's results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, there can be no
absolute assurance that third parties will convert their systems in a timely
manner and in a way that is compatible with the Company's systems.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, certain members of the European Union established fixed
conversion rates between their existing currencies and the European Union's
common currency, known as the Euro. The transition period for the introduction
of the Euro will be between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2002. It is
planned that by July 1, 2002, the participating countries will withdraw all
currencies and use the Euro exclusively.

The Company has committed resources to conduct assessments and to take
corrective actions to ensure it is prepared for the introduction of the Euro.
The Company is currently evaluating methods to address the many areas involved
with the introduction of the Euro, including information management, finance,
legal and tax. This review includes the conversion of information technology,
business and financial systems, evaluating currency risk and the effect on
the Company's financial instruments as well as the impact on the pricing and
the distribution of the Company's products.

The Company believes the effect of the introduction of the Euro, as well as
any related cost of conversion, will not have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Financial Position

Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at
December 31, 1998 were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar instruments with
near-term maturities.  The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents
was 4.7% at December 31, 1998 while interest yields on time deposits and
marketable securities averaged 4.5% at December 31, 1998.

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 1998 are denominated
primarily in U.S. dollars; however, a subsidiary of the Company had $167
million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 1998. This commercial
paper has original maturities not exceeding 270 days.  $116 million is
denominated in ECU's (Euros) and $51 million is denominated in U.S. dollars.
Also included is Japanese yen long-term debt of $284 million.

During 1998, the Company entered into two credit facilities, aggregating
$500 million, with a syndicate of lenders as support for its commercial paper
program.  The credit facilities consist of a $250 million, 364-day credit
facility which may be renewed annually with the consent of the lenders for
an additional 364-day period and a $250 million, 5-year credit facility,
extendible at each anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. There
were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities at December 31,
1998.  In addition, the Company has unused short-term lines of credit with
foreign banks of $494 million.

Disclosures related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt are included
in the notes to the financial statements.

Internally generated cash provided by operations was $4.1 billion in 1998,
$2.5 billion in 1997 and $2.6 billion in 1996.  Cash provided by operations
continued to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating
needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment.  As part of the Company's
ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research
facilities, the Company has invested over $2.1 billion in capital expansion
over the past three years.

Cash provided by operations also was used to pay dividends of over $4.5
billion over the past three years, to fund acquisitions at a cost of $663
million over the past three years, and to finance the share repurchase
program.  The Company's share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of
common stock from time to time in the open market or through private
transactions as market conditions permit.  During 1998, the Company purchased
30.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.6 billion, bringing the
total shares acquired since the program's inception to 277 million.  During
the past three years, the Company has repurchased 101 million shares at a
cost of $3.6 billion.

Employment levels at December 1998 increased to 54,700 from 53,600 at December
1997, with increases primarily in pharmaceutical sales force and research and
development personnel.

Return on Stockholders' Equity continued to improve over the last three years
and was 49.2% in 1998, excluding the special charge, 46.5% in 1997 and 46.0%
in 1996.

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                         (dollars in millions)


Note 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------

Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include
securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase,
recorded at cost, which approximates market.

Time Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable
securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which
approximates cost.

Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not
in excess of market.

Capital Assets and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and
betterments are capitalized at cost.  Depreciation is generally computed by
the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related
assets.

Excess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net tangible
assets received in business acquisitions is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods not exceeding 40 years.

Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per common share are computed using the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted
earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the year, plus the incremental shares outstanding
assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options.


Note 2  SPECIAL CHARGE
- ----------------------

As described in Note 16, the Company has determined the final cost of its
breast implant product liability (related to a previously discontinued
business of a subsidiary) and the cost of litigation for prescription drug
pricing cases. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company
recorded a special charge of $800 million before taxes, $495 million after
taxes, or $.24 per diluted share, to augment the reserve for breast implant
liability and for the prescription drug pricing litigation, offset by expected
insurance recoveries. The breast implant component of the charge is $700
million before taxes ($800 million of liability offset by insurance
receivables of $100 million), and the prescription drug pricing component is
$100 million before taxes.

The Company has settled its United States Federal income tax returns with the
Internal Revenue Service through 1991.

United States Federal income taxes have not been provided on substantially
all of the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since it is
management's practice and intent to reinvest such earnings in the operations
of these subsidiaries.  The total amount of the net unremitted earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $3.2 billion at December 31, 1998.

Note 9  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT
- ------------------------------------------------

Included in short-term borrowings were amounts due to banks, primarily
foreign banks, of $272 million, $524 million and $440 million at December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and current installments of long-term debt
of $43 million, $19 million and $73 million at December 31, 1998, 1997, and
1996, respectively.  Also included in short-term borrowings at December 31,
1998, was $167 million of commercial paper outstanding issued by a subsidiary
of the Company.  This commercial paper has original maturities not exceeding
270 days and is denominated in ECUs (Euros) and U.S. dollars.  The average
interest rate on short-term borrowings was 8.84% and on current installments
of long-term debt was 6.56% at December 31, 1998.

During 1998, the Company entered into two credit facilities, aggregating
$500 million, with a syndicate of lenders as support for its commercial paper
program.  The credit facilities consist of a $250 million, 364-day credit
facility, which may be renewed annually with the consent of the lenders for
an additional 364-day period and a $250 million, 5-year credit facility,
extendible at each anniversary date with the consent of the lenders.  There
were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities at December 31,
1998.  In addition, the Company has unused short-term lines of credit with
foreign banks of $494 million.

Each share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into 16.96 shares
of common stock and is callable at the Company's option.  The reductions in
the number of issued shares of preferred stock in 1998, 1997 and 1996 were
due to conversions into shares of common stock.

Dividends per common share were $.78 in 1998, $.76 in 1997 and $.75 in 1996.

Stock Compensation Plans
- ------------------------

Under the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, officers, directors and key
employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at
no less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is granted.
Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25% per year on each
of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a
maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the plan provides for the granting
of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may surrender exercisable
options and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess of the
market price of the common stock over the option exercise price.  The plan
also provides for the granting of performance-based stock options to certain
key executives.

Under the terms of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, additional
shares are authorized in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per
year through 2002.  The plan incorporates the Company's long-term performance
awards.

In addition, the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of up
to 20,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to restrictions
as to continuous employment except in the case of death or normal retirement.
Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period from date of grant.
Compensation expense is recognized over the restricted period.  At December 31,
1998, a total of 2,536,364 restricted shares were outstanding under the plan.

Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding key
executives, meeting certain years of service requirements are granted options
to purchase the Company's common stock at the market price on the date the
options are granted.  The Company has authorized 60,000,000 shares for
issuance under the plan.  As of December 31, 1998, a total of 59,482,400
options were granted under the plan with generally 800 options granted to
each eligible employee.  Individual grants generally become exercisable on or
after the third anniversary of the grant date.  As of December 31, 1998,
18,841,100 shares have been exercised under the plan.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for
its plans.  Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted stock and
performance-based awards.  Had compensation cost for the Company's other stock
option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for
awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, the Company's net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced by approximately $136 million, or $.07 per common
share, basic and diluted, in 1998, $85 million, or $.04 per common share,
basic and diluted, in 1997 and $55 million, or $.03 per common share, basic
and diluted, in 1996.  The fair value of the options granted during 1998, 1997
and 1996 was estimated as $11.80 per common share, $6.41 per common share and
$4.26 per common share, respectively, on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Note 11  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
- ------------------------------

Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts,
are used to hedge anticipated transactions.

The Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities, which approximated $2,310 million, $2,070 million and $1,640
million at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, primarily in
Deutsche marks, French francs, Italian lire and Japanese yen.  The Company
mitigates the effect of these exposures through third-party borrowings.

The risk of loss associated with the types of foreign exchange option
contracts entered into by the Company is limited to premium amounts paid for
the option contracts.  Premiums are deferred in Prepaid Expenses and amortized
in the consolidated statement of earnings (in the Other caption) over the
time frame of the underlying hedged transaction.  Gains and losses related
to the option contracts, which qualify as hedges of foreign currency
anticipated transactions, are recognized in earnings when the hedged
transactions are recognized.  Gains and losses on foreign exchange forward
contracts are recognized in the basis of the underlying transaction being
hedged.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                              (dollars in millions)

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets were $288 million, $230 million and
$40 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1998, $271 million, $208 million
and $37 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1997, and $272 million,
$202 million and $38 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1996.  This
is primarily attributable to an unfunded benefit equalization plan.

In 1998, the increase in total projected benefit obligation was due to a lower
discount rate.

The principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings
and Investment Program.  The Company's contribution is based on employee
contributions and the level of company match.  Company contributions to the
plan were $45 million in 1998, $40 million in 1997 and $39 million in 1996.


Note 15  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
- ---------------------------------------------------------

The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits to
substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company's
comprehensive medical and group life plans.  The medical plan is contributory.
Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the
original retiring company.  The life insurance plan is non-contributory.  Plan
assets principally consist of equity securities and fixed income securities.

Cost for the Company's postretirement benefit plans included the following
components:

For measurement purposes, an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits of 7.2% for participants under age 65 and
6.7% for participants age 65 and over was assumed for 1999; the rate was
assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% in 2007 and to remain at that level
thereafter.

A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would
have the following effects:

In 1998, the increase in total benefit obligation was due to a lower
discount rate.


Note 16  CONTINGENCIES
- ----------------------

Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its
businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
The most significant of these are described below.  Reference is made to
Item 3 Legal Proceedings in Part 1 of this Form 10-K Annual Report.

Breast Implant Litigation
- -------------------------

The Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation
(MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in a number
of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various
types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled
breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related company.  Of the
more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against the Company in direct

lawsuits or through registration in the nationwide class action settlement
approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham, Alabama (the Revised
Settlement), most have been dealt with through the Revised Settlement, other
settlements, or trial.  It is expected that as of January 1, 1999, the
Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims will be
limited to residual unpaid Revised Settlement obligations and to roughly 6,000
remaining opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court.

As of December 31, 1998, approximately 15,000 United States and 1,300 foreign
breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and
state courts in the United States and in certain courts in Canada and
Australia.  These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are in the
process of being settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about 10,200
U.S. and 400 foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement.  The
lawsuits of the 4,800 U.S. plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected to be
dismissed since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000 women with MEC
implants who chose to participate in the nationwide settlement.  Of the
remaining opt-out plaintiffs, some have claims based upon products that were
not manufactured and sold by MEC; many others have claims that are in the
process of being settled.  Under the terms of the Revised Settlement,
additional opt-outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for U.S.
class members to opt out has passed. In addition, the Company's remaining
obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are limited because most
payments to "Current Claimants" already have been made, no additional
"Current Claims" may be filed without court approval, and because payments
of claims to so-called "Other Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited
by the terms of the Revised Settlement.  Separate class action settlements
have been approved in the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an
agreement has been reached under which other foreign breast implant recipients
may settle their claims.  The Company believes it will be able to address
remaining opt-out claims as well as expected remaining obligations under
the Revised Settlement Program within its reserves described below.

In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million
before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant cases.
The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses,
offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds.  In the fourth quarters
of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750
million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950 million before taxes
($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product
liability claims. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded an
additional special charge to earnings in the amount of $800 million before
taxes and increased its insurance receivable in the amount of $100 million,
resulting in a net charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect
of breast implant product liability claims.  At December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996 the amount of insurance recoverable was $523 million, $619 million and
$853 million, respectively, and included in current and other liabilities
for product liability claims was $1,121 million, $1,036 million and $1,831
million, respectively.

Prescription Drug Litigation
- ----------------------------

As of December 31, 1998, the Company is a defendant in over 100 actions
brought against the Company and more than 30 other pharmaceutical
manufacturers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers in various
federal district courts by certain chain drugstores, supermarket chains
and independent drug stores, which opted out of a nationwide class (previously
settled by the Company) and are suing individually.  These cases have been
coordinated for pretrial purposes and all seek treble damages and injunctive
relief on account of alleged antitrust violations in the pricing and marketing
of brand name prescription drugs.  Cases brought by retail pharmacies in state
court under state law alleging similar grounds are pending in California,
Alabama and Mississippi.  Purported class actions, some

purportedly multistate in reach, brought by consumers in state court under
state law alleging similar grounds have been settled, subject to court
approval, in California and remain pending in Alabama and Tennessee.  In the
fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a special charge to earnings in
the amount of $100 million before taxes ($62 million after taxes) in respect
of this prescription drug litigation.  While it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management
that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating
results, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company



In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14(a)(1) and (2) on page 63 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                         BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
                          1997 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
                      (as amended as of November 3, 1998)




1. Purpose: The purpose of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan is to secure for the
Company and its stockholders the benefits of the incentive inherent in common
stock ownership by the officers and key employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates who will be largely responsible for the Company's
future growth and continued financial success and by providing long-term
incentives in addition to current compensation to certain key executives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who contribute significantly
to the long-term performance and growth of the Company and such Subsidiaries
and Affiliates. It is intended that the former purpose will be effected through
the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents
and/or restricted stock under the Plan and that the latter purpose will be
effected through an award conditionally granting performance units or
performance shares under the Plan, either independently or in conjunction with
and related to a nonqualified stock option grant under the Plan.

2. Definitions: For purposes of this Plan:

   (a) "Affiliate" shall mean any entity in which the Company has an ownership
        interest of at least 20%.

   (b) "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

   (c) "Common Stock" shall mean the Company's common stock (par value $.10
        per share).

        its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.

   (e) "Disability" or "Disabled" shall mean qualifying for and receiving

        or Affiliate.

        as amended.

   (g) "Fair Market Value" shall mean the average of the high and low sale
        prices of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
        composite tape on the date of measurement or on any date as determined
        by the Committee and if there were no trades on such date, on the day
        on which a trade occurred next preceding such date.

   (h) "Issuer" shall mean the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

   (i) "Prior Plan" shall mean the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 1983 Stock
        Option Plan as amended and restated effective as of September 10, 1996.

   (j) "Retirement" shall mean termination of the employment of an employee
        with the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate on or after (i) the
        employee's 65th birthday or (ii) the employee's 55th birthday if the
        employee has completed 10 years of service with the Company, its
        Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates. For purposes of this Section 2(j)
        and all other purposes of this Plan, Retirement shall also mean
        termination of employment of an employee with the Company or a
        Subsidiary or Affiliate for any reason (other than the employee's
        death, disability, resignation, willful misconduct or activity deemed
        detrimental to the interests of the Company) where, on termination,
        the employee's age plus years of service (rounded up to the next
        higher whole number) equals at least 70 and the employee has completed
        10 years of service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
        Affiliates.

<PAGE>

   Furthermore, an employee who makes an election to retire under Article 19
of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan (the "Retirement
Income Plan") shall have any additional years of age and service which are
credited under Article 19 of the Retirement Income Plan taken into account
when determining such employee's age and service under this Section 2(j). Such
election shall be deemed a Retirement for purposes of this Section 2(j) and
all other purposes of this Plan.

   (k) "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation which at the time qualifies as a
        subsidiary of the Company under the definition of "subsidiary

not made subject to a grant or award in such prior year and (iii) the number
of shares that were subject to options or awards granted hereunder or under
the Prior Plan, which options or awards terminated or expired in the prior
year without being exercised. No individual may be granted options or awards
under Sections 6, 7 or 8 in the aggregate, in respect of more than 1,500,000
shares of the Company's Common Stock in a calendar year; upon a change in
stock the maximum number of shares shall be adjusted in number and kind
pursuant to Section 10. Aggregate shares issued under performance share
awards made pursuant to Section 7 and restricted stock awards made pursuant
to Section 8 may not exceed 10,000,000 shares over the life of the Plan.
Common Stock issued hereunder may be authorized and reissued shares or issued
shares acquired by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the market or otherwise.

4. Administration: The Plan shall be administered under the supervision of the
Board of Directors of the Company which shall exercise its powers, to the
extent herein provided, through the agency of a Compensation and Management
Development Committee (the "Committee") which shall be appointed by the Board
of Directors of the Company. The Committee shall consist of not less than
three (3) members of the Board who meet the definition of "outside director"
under the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code and the definition of
"non-employee directors" under the provisions of the Exchange Act or rules
or regulations promulgated thereunder. No member of the Committee shall have
been within one year prior to appointment to, or while serving on, the
Committee granted or awarded equity securities of the Company pursuant to this
or any other plan of the Company except to the extent that participation in
any such plan or receipt of any such grant or award would not adversely affect
the Committee member's status as a "nonemployee director" or as an "outside
director".

   The Committee, from time to time, may adopt rules and regulations
("Regulations") for carrying out the provisions and purposes of the Plan and
make such other determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan,
as the Committee shall deem appropriate. The interpretation and construction
of any provision of the Plan by the Committee shall, unless otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors, be final and conclusive.

   The Committee shall maintain a written record of its proceedings. A majority
of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the acts of a majority of the
members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, or acts
unanimously approved in writing, shall be the acts of the Committee.

5. Eligibility: Options and awards may be granted only to present or future
officers and key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
including Subsidiaries and Affiliates which become such after the adoption of
the Plan. Any officer or key employee of the Company or of any such Subsidiary
or Affiliate shall be eligible to receive one or more options or awards under
the Plan. Any director who is not an officer or employee of the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and any member of the Committee, during the

                                 E-1-2
<PAGE>

time of the member's service as such or thereafter, shall be ineligible to
receive an option or award under the Plan. The adoption of this Plan shall not
be deemed to give any officer or employee any right to an award or to be
granted an option to purchase Common Stock of the Company, except to the
extent and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the
Committee.

6. Stock Options: Stock options under the Plan shall consist of incentive
stock options under Section 422 of the Code or nonqualified stock options
(options not intended to qualify as incentive stock options), as the Committee
shall determine. In addition, the Committee may grant stock appreciation
rights in conjunction with an option, as set forth in Section 6(b)(11), or
may grant awards in conjunction with an option, as set forth in Section
6(b)(10) (an "Associated Option").

   Each option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

   (a) Grant of Options. The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key
       employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom
       options may from time to time be granted, (2) determine whether
       incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options are to be granted,
       (3) determine the number of shares to be covered by each option so
       granted, (4) determine the terms and conditions (not inconsistent with
       the Plan) of any option granted hereunder (including but not limited
       to restrictions upon the options, conditions of their exercise, or on
       the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise thereof), (5)
       determine whether nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options
       granted under the Plan shall include stock appreciation rights and,
       if so, shall determine the terms and conditions thereof in accordance
       with Section 6(b)(11) hereof, (6) determine whether any nonqualified
       stock options granted under the Plan shall be Associated Options, and
       (7) prescribe the form of the instruments necessary or advisable in the
       administration of options.

   (b) Terms and Conditions of Option. Any option granted under the Plan shall
       be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement executed by the Company and the
       optionee, in such form as the Committee shall approve, which agreement
       shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain
       such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan, and
       in the case of an incentive stock option not inconsistent with the
       provisions of the Code applicable to incentive stock options, as the
       Committee shall prescribe:

       (1) Number of Shares Subject to an Option. The Stock Option Agreement
           shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
           Agreement. If the option is an Associated Option, the number of
           shares of Common Stock subject to such Associated Option shall
           initially be equal to the number of performance units or performance
           shares subject to the award, but one share of Common Stock shall be
           canceled for each performance unit or performance share paid out
           under the award.

       (2) Option Price. The purchase price per share of Common Stock
           purchasable under an option will be determined by the Committee but
           will be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common
           Stock on the date of the grant of such option.

       (3) Option Period. The period of each option shall be fixed by the
           Committee, but no option shall be exercisable after the expiration
           of ten years from the date the option is granted.

       (4) Consideration. Each optionee, as consideration for the grant of an
           option, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or of
           one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year from
           the date of the granting of such option, and no option shall be
           exercisable until after the completion of such one year period of
           employment by the optionee.

                                        E-1-3
<PAGE>

       (5) Exercise of Option. An option may be exercised in whole or in part
           from time to time during the option period (or, if determined by
           the Committee, in specified installments during the option period)
           by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the
           number of shares to be purchased, such notice to be accompanied by
           payment in full of the purchase price and Withholding Taxes (as
           defined in Section 11 hereof), unless an election to defer receipt
           of shares is made under Section 12, due either by certified or bank
           check, or in shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the
           optionee having a Fair Market Value at the date of exercise equal to
           such purchase price, or in a combination of the foregoing; provided,
           however, that payment in shares of Common Stock of the Company will
           not be permitted unless at least 100 shares of Common Stock are
           required and delivered for such purpose. No shares shall be issued
           until full payment therefor has been made. An optionee shall have
           the rights of a stockholder only with respect to shares of stock
           for which certificates have been issued to the optionee.

       (6) Nontransferability of Options. No option or stock appreciation right
           granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee
           otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution,
           and such option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable,
           during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may set forth in a
           Stock Option Agreement at the time of grant or thereafter, that the
           options (other than Incentive Stock Options) may be transferred to
           members of the optionee's immediate family, to trusts solely for the
           benefit of such immediate family members and to partnerships in
           which such family members and/or trusts are the only partners. For
           this purpose, immediate family means the optionee's spouse, parents,
           children, stepchildren, grandchildren and legal dependants. Any
           transfer of options made under this provision will not be effective
           until notice of such transfer is delivered to the Company.

       (7) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or
           Disability. If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the Company
           or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason (other than
           termination of employment by reason of death or Disability) after
           the optionee shall have been continuously so employed for one year
           after the granting of the option, the option shall be exercisable
           only to the extent that the optionee was otherwise entitled to
           exercise it at the time of such cessation of employment with the
           Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, but in no event after the
           expiration of the option period set forth therein except that in the
           case of cessation of employment other than by reason of Retirement
           or death, the option shall in no event be exercisable after the date
           three months next succeeding such cessation of employment. The Plan
           does not confer upon any optionee any right with respect to
           continuation of employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
           or Affiliates.

       (8) Disability of Optionee. An optionee who ceases to be employed by
           reason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee
           remained in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate
           until the earlier of (i) cessation of payments under a disability
           pay plan of the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, (ii) the
           optionee's death, or (iii) the optionee's 65th birthday.

       (9) Death of Optionee.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (13),
           in the event of the optionee's death (i) while in the employ of the
           Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) while
           Disabled as described in subsection (8) or (iii) after cessation
           of employment due to Retirement, the option shall be fully
           exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees or
           distributees of the optionee's estate, as the case may be, at any
           time following such death.  In the event of the optionee's death
           after cessation of employment for any reason other than Disability
           or Retirement, the option shall be exercisable by the executors,
           administrators, legatees or distributees of the optionee's estate,
           as the case may be, at any time during the twelve month period
           following such death.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
           shall an option be exercisable unless the optionee shall have been
           continuously employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
           Affiliates for a period of at least one year after the option grant,
           and no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of the
           option period set forth in the Stock Option Agreement.  In the event

                                      E-1-4
<PAGE>

           any option is exercised by the executors, administrators, legatees
           or distributees of the estate of a deceased optionee, the Company
           shall be under no obligation to issue stock thereunder unless and
           until the Company is satisfied that the person or persons exercising
           the option are the duly appointed legal representatives of the
           deceased optionee's estate or the proper legatees or distributees
           thereof.

       (10) Long-Term Performance Awards. The Committee may from time to time
           grant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with
           and related to an award of performance units or performance shares
           made under a Long-Term Performance Award as set forth in Section
           7(b)(11). In such event, notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
           (i) the number of shares to which the Associated Option applies
           shall initially be equal to the number of performance units or
           performance shares granted by the award, but such number of shares
           shall be reduced on a one-share-for-one unit or share basis to the
           extent that the Committee determines pursuant to the terms of the
           award, to pay to the optionee or the optionee's beneficiary the
           performance units or performance shares granted pursuant to such
           award; and (ii) such Associated Option shall be cancelable in the
           discretion of the Committee, without the consent of the optionee,
           under the conditions and to the extent specified in the award.

       (11) Stock Appreciation Rights. In the case of any option granted under
           the Plan, either at the time of grant or by amendment of such option
           at any time after such grant there may be included a stock
           appreciation right which shall be subject to such terms and
           conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee shall
           impose, including the following:

          (A) A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable to the extent,
              and only to the extent, that the option in which it is included
              is at the time exercisable, and may be exercised within such
              period only at such time or times as may be determined by the
              Committee;

          (B) A stock appreciation right shall entitle the optionee (or any
              person entitled to act under the provisions of subsection (9)
              hereof) to surrender unexercised the option in which the stock
              appreciation right is included (or any portion of such option)
              to the Company and to receive from the Company in exchange
              therefor that number of shares having an aggregate value equal
              to (or, in the discretion of the Committee, less than) the excess
              of the value of one share (provided such value does not exceed
              such multiple of the option price per share as may be specified
              by the Committee) over the option price per share specified in
              such option times the number of shares called for by the option,
              or portion thereof, which is so surrendered. The Committee shall
              be entitled to cause the Company to settle its obligation,
              arising out of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, by
              the payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares
              the Company would otherwise be obligated to deliver or partly
              by the payment of cash and partly by the delivery of shares. Any
              such election shall be made within 30 business days after the
              receipt by the Committee of written notice of the exercise of
              the stock appreciation right. The value of a share for this
              purpose shall be the Fair Market Value thereof on the last
              business day preceding the date of the election to exercise the
              stock appreciation right;

          (C) No fractional shares shall be delivered under this subsection
              (11) but in lieu thereof a cash adjustment shall be made;

          (D) If a stock appreciation right included in an option is exercised,
              such option shall be deemed to have been exercised to the extent
              of the number of shares called for by the option or portion
              thereof which is surrendered on exercise of the stock
              appreciation right and no new option may be granted covering
              such shares under this Plan; and

                                           E-1-5
<PAGE>


          (E) If an option which includes a stock appreciation right is
              exercised, such stock appreciation right shall be deemed to have
              been canceled to the extent of the number of shares called for
              by the option or portion thereof is exercised and no new stock
              appreciation rights may be granted covering such shares under
              this Plan.


       (12) Incentive Stock Options. In the case of any incentive stock option
            granted under the Plan, the aggregate Fair Market Value of the
            shares of Common Stock of the Company (determined at the time of
            grant of each option) with respect to which incentive stock options
            granted under the Plan and any other plan of the Company or its
            parent or a Subsidiary which are exercisable for the first time by
            an employee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000 or
            such other amount as may be required by the Code. In any year, the
            maximum number of shares with respect to which incentive stock
            options may be granted shall not exceed 4,000,000 shares.


   (13) Rights of Transferee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
        if an option has been transferred in accordance with Section 6(b)(6),
        the option shall be exercisable solely by the transferee. The option
        shall remain subject to the provisions of the Plan, including that it
        will be exercisable only to the extent that the optionee or optionee's
        estate would have been entitled to exercise it if the optionee had not
        transferred the option.  In the event of the death of the optionee
        prior to the expiration of the right to exercise the transferred
        option, the period during which the option shall be exercisable will
        terminate on the date one year following the date of the optionee's
        death.  In the event of the death of the transferee prior to the
        expiration of the right to exercise the option, the period during
        which the option shall be exercisable by the executors, administrators,
        legatees and distributees of the transferee's estate, as the case may
        be, will terminate on the date one year following the date of the
        transferee's death.  In no event will be the option be exercisable
        after the expiration of the option period set forth in the Stock Option
        Agreement.  The option shall be subject to such other rules as the
        Committee shall determine.

7. Long-term Performance Awards: Awards under the Plan shall consist of the
conditional grant to the participants of a specified number of performance
units or performance shares. The conditional grant of a performance unit to
a participant will entitle the participant to receive a specified dollar value,
variable under conditions specified in the award, if the performance objectives
specified in the award are achieved and the other terms and conditions thereof
are satisfied. The conditional grant of a performance share to a participant
will entitle the participant to receive a specified number of shares of Common
Stock of the Company, or the equivalent cash value, if the objective(s)
specified in the award are achieved and the other terms and conditions thereof
are satisfied.

   Each award will be subject to the following terms and conditions:

   (a) Grant of Awards. The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key
       executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom
       awards may from time to time be granted, (2) determine the number of
       performance units or performance shares covered by each award, (3)
       determine the terms and conditions of each performance unit or
       performance share awarded and the award period and performance
       objectives with respect to each award, (4) determine the periods
       during which a participant may request the Committee to approve
       deferred payment of a percentage (not less than 25%) of an award
       (the "Deferred Portion") and the interest or rate of return thereon or
       the basis on which such interest or rate of return thereon is to be
       determined, (5) determine whether payment with respect to the portion
       of an award which has not been deferred (the "Current Portion") and
       the payment with respect to the Deferred Portion of an award shall be
       made entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and
       partially in Common Stock, (6) determine whether the award is to be
       made independently of or in conjunction with a nonqualified stock option
       granted under the Plan, and (7) prescribe the form of the instruments
       necessary or advisable in the administration of the awards.

                                      E-1-6
<PAGE>


   (b) Terms and Conditions of Award. Any award conditionally granting
       performance units or performance shares to a participant shall be
       evidenced by a Performance Unit Agreement or Performance Share
       Agreement, as applicable, executed by the Company and the participant,
       in such form as the Committee shall approve, which Agreement shall
       contain in substance the following terms and conditions applicable to
       the award and such additional terms and conditions as the Committee
       shall prescribe:

       (1) Number and Value of Performance Units. The Performance Unit
           Agreement shall specify the number of performance units
           conditionally granted to the participant. If the award has been
           made in conjunction with the grant of an Associated Option, the
           number of performance units granted shall initially be equal to
           the number of shares which the participant is granted the right
           to purchase pursuant to the Associated Option, but one
           performance unit shall be canceled for each share of the Company's
           Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Associated Option or
           for each stock appreciation right included in such option that has
           been exercised. The Performance Unit Agreement shall specify the
           threshold, target and maximum dollar values of each performance
           unit and corresponding performance objectives as provided under
           Section 6(b)(5). No payout under a performance unit award to an
           individual Participant may exceed 0.15% of the pre-tax earnings
           of the Company for the fiscal year which coincides with the final
           year of the performance unit period.

       (2) Number and Value of Performance Shares. The Performance Share
           Agreement shall specify the number of performance shares
           conditionally granted to the participant. If the award has been
           made in conjunction with the grant of an Associated Option, the
           number of performance shares granted shall initially be equal to
           the number of shares which the participant is granted the right to
           purchase pursuant to the Associated Option, but one performance
           share shall be canceled for each share of the Company's Common
           Stock purchased upon exercise of the Associated Option or for each
           stock appreciation right included in such option that has been
           exercised. The Performance Share Agreement shall specify that each
           Performance Share will have a value equal to one (1) share of
           Common Stock of the Company.

       (3) Award Periods. For each award, the Committee shall designate an
           award period with a duration to be determined by the Committee in
           its discretion but in no event less than three calendar years within
           which specified performance objectives are to be attained. There
           may be several award periods in existence at any one time and the
           duration of performance objectives may differ from each other.

       (4) Consideration. Each participant, as consideration for the award of
           performance units or performance shares, shall remain in the
           continuous employ of the Company or of one of its Subsidiaries or
           Affiliates for at least one year after the date of the making of
           such award, and no award shall be payable until after the
           completion of such one year of employment by the participant.

       (5) Performance Objectives. The Committee shall establish performance
           objectives with respect to the Company for each award period on the
           basis of such criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the
           Committee may from time to time determine. Performance criteria
           for awards under the Plan may include one or more of the following
           measures of the operating performance:

            a. Earnings                        d. Financial return ratios
            b. Revenue                         e. Total Shareholder Return
            c. Operating or net cash flows     f. Market share


                                      E-1-7
<PAGE>

       The Committee shall establish the specific targets for the selected
       criteria. These targets may be set at a specific level or may be
       expressed as relative to the comparable measure at comparison companies
       or a defined index. These targets may be based upon the total Company
       or upon a defined business unit which the executive has responsibility
       for or influence over.

       (6) Determination and Payment of Performance Units or Performance Shares
           Earned. As soon as practicable after the end of an award period, the
           Committee shall determine the extent to which awards have been
           earned on the basis of the Company's actual performance in relation
           to the established performance objectives as set forth in the
           Performance Unit Agreement or Performance Share Agreement and
           certify these results in writing. The Performance Unit Agreement
           or Performance Share Agreement shall specify that as soon as
           practicable after the end of each award period, the Committee shall
           determine whether the conditions of Sections 7(b)(4) and 7(b)(5)
           hereof have been met and, if so, shall ascertain the amount payable
           or shares which should be distributed to the participant in respect
           of the performance units or performance shares. As promptly as
           practicable after it has determined that an amount is payable or
           should be distributed in respect of an award, the Committee shall
           cause the Current Portion of such award to be paid or distributed
           to the participant or the participant's beneficiaries, as the case
           may be, in the Committee's discretion, either entirely in cash,
           entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and partially in
           Common Stock. The Deferred Portion of an award shall be
           contingently credited and payable to the participant over a
           deferred period and shall be credited with interest, rate of
           return, or other valuation as determined by the Committee. The
           Committee, in its discretion, shall determine the conditions upon,
           and method of, payment of such Deferred Portions and whether such
           payment will be made entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or
           partially in cash and partially in Common Stock.


       In making the payment of an award in Common Stock hereunder, the cash
       equivalent of such Common Stock shall be determined by the Fair Market
       Value of the Common Stock on the day the Committee designates the
       performance units shall be payable.

       (7) Nontransferability of Awards and Designation of Beneficiaries. No
           award under this Section of the Plan shall be transferable by the
           participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and
           distribution, except that a participant may designate a beneficiary
           pursuant to the provisions hereof.

       If any participant or the participant's beneficiary shall attempt to
       assign the participant's rights under the Plan in violation of the
       provisions thereof, the Company's obligation to make any further
       payments to such participant or the participant's beneficiaries shall
       forthwith terminate.

       A participant may name one or more beneficiaries to receive any payment
       of an award to which the participant may be entitled under the Plan in
       the event of the participant's death, on a form to be provided by the
       Committee. A participant may change the participant's beneficiary
       designation from time to time in the same manner.

       If no designated beneficiary is living on the date on which any payment
       becomes payable to a participant's beneficiary, or if no beneficiary
       has been specified by the participant, such payment will be payable to
       the person or persons in the first of the following classes of
       successive preference:

           (i)   Widow or widower, if then living,
           (ii)  Surviving children, equally,
           (iii) Surviving parents, equally,
           (iv)  Surviving brothers and sisters, equally,
           (v)   Executors or administrators

                                     E-1-8
<PAGE>

       and the term "beneficiary" as used in the Plan shall include such person
       or persons.

       (8) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other Than by Death or
           Disability. In the event of the Retirement prior to the end of an
           award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year
           employment requirement of Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an award
           prior to Retirement, the participant, or his estate, shall be
           entitled to a payment of such award at the end of the award period,
           pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the participant's Performance
           Unit Agreement or Performance Share Agreement, provided, however,
           that the participant shall be deemed to have earned that proportion
           (to the nearest whole unit or share) of the value of the performance
           units or performance shares granted to the participant under such
           award as the number of months of the award period which have
           elapsed since the first day of the calendar year in which the award
           was made to the end of the month in which the participant's
           Retirement occurs, bears to the total number of months in the
           award period, subject to the attainment of performance objectives
           associated with the award as certified by the Committee. The
           participant's right to receive any remaining performance units or
           performance shares shall be canceled and forfeited.

       Subject to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, the Performance Unit Agreement or
       Performance Share Agreement shall specify that the right to receive the
       performance units or performance shares granted to such participant
       shall be conditional and shall be canceled, forfeited and surrendered
       if the participant's continuous employment with the Company and its
       Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall terminate for any reason, other than
       the participant's death, Disability or Retirement prior to the end of
       the award period.


       (9) Disability of Participant. For the purposes of any award a
           participant who becomes Disabled shall be deemed to have suspended
           active employment by reason of Disability commencing on the date
           the participant becomes entitled to receive payments under a
           disability pay plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
           and continuing until the date the participant is no longer entitled
           to receive such payments. In the event a participant becomes
           Disabled during an award period but only if the participant has
           satisfied the one year employment requirement of Section 7(b)(4)
           with respect to an award prior to becoming Disabled, upon the
           determination by the Committee of the extent to which an award has
           been earned pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) the participant shall be
           deemed to have earned that proportion (to the nearest whole unit)
           of the value of the performance units granted to the participants
           under such award as the number of months of the award period in
           which the participant was not Disabled bears to the total number
           of months in the award period subject to the attainment of the
           performance objectives associated with the award as certified by
           the Committee. The participant's right to receive any remaining
           performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

       (10) Death of Participant. In the event of the death prior to the end
            of an award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year
            employment requirement with respect to an award prior to the date
            of death, the participant's beneficiaries or estate, as the case
            may be, shall be entitled to a payment of such award upon the end
            of the award period, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the
            participant's Performance Unit Agreement or Performance Share
            Agreement, provided, however, that the participant shall be deemed
            to have earned that proportion (to the nearest whole unit or share)
            of the value of the performance units or performance shares granted
            to the participant under such award as the number of months of the
            award period which have elapsed since the first day of the calendar
            year in which the award was made to the end of the month in which
            the participant's death occurs, bears to the total number of months
            in the award period. The participant's right to receive any
            remaining performance units or performance shares shall be canceled
            and forfeited.

       The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such
       cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units or performance
       shares.

                                        E-1-9

       (11) Grant of Associated Option. If the Committee determines that the
            conditional grant of performance units or performance shares under
            the Plan is to be made to a participant in conjunction with the
            grant of a nonqualified stock option under the Plan, the Committee
            shall grant the participant an Associated Option under the Plan
            subject to the terms and conditions of this subsection (11). In
            such event, such award under the Plan shall be contingent upon
            the participant's being granted such an Associated Option pursuant
            to which: (i) the number of shares the optionee may purchase shall
            initially be equal to the number of performance units or
            performance shares conditionally granted by the award, (ii) such
            number of shares shall be reduced on a one-share-for-one-unit or
            share basis to the extent that the Committee determines, pursuant
            to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, to pay to the participant or the
            participant's beneficiaries the performance units or performance
            shares conditionally granted pursuant to the award, and (iii) the
            Associated Option shall be cancelable in the discretion of the
            Committee, without the consent of the participant, under the
            conditions and to the extent specified herein and in Section
            7(b)(6) hereof.


       If no amount is payable in respect of the conditionally granted
       performance units or performance shares, the award and such performance
       units or performance shares shall be deemed to have been canceled,
       forfeited and surrendered, and the Associated Option, if any, shall
       continue in effect in accordance with its terms. If any amount is
       payable in respect of the performance units or performance shares and
       such units or shares were granted in conjunction with an Associated
       Option, the Committee shall, within 30 days after the determination of
       the Committee referred to in the first sentence of Section 7(b)(6),
       determine, in its sole discretion, either:

            (a) to cancel in full the Associated Option, in which event the
                value of the performance units or performance shares payable
                pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5) and (6) shall be paid or the
                performance shares shall be distributed;

            (b) to cancel in full the performance units or performance shares,
                in which event no amount shall be paid to the participant in
                respect thereof and no shares shall be distributed but the
                Associated Option shall continue in effect in accordance with
                its terms; or

            (c) to cancel some, but not all, of the performance units or
                performance shares, in which event the value of the performance
                units payable pursuant to Sections 7(b)(5) and (6) which have
                not been canceled shall be paid and/or the performance shares
                shall be distributed and the Associated Option shall be
                canceled with respect to that number of shares equal to the
                number of conditionally granted performance units or
                performance shares that remain payable.

            Any action taken by the Committee pursuant to the preceding
            sentence shall be uniform with respect to all awards having the
            same award period. If the Committee takes no such action, it shall
            be deemed to have determined to cancel in full the award in
            accordance with clause (b) above.

8. Restricted Stock: Restricted stock awards under the Plan shall consist of
grants of shares of Common Stock of the Issuer subject to the terms and
conditions hereinafter provided.

   (a) Grant of Awards: The Committee shall (i) select the officers and key
       employees to whom Restricted Stock may from time to time be granted,
       (ii) determine the number of shares to be covered by each award granted,
       (iii) determine the terms and conditions (not inconsistent with the
       Plan) of any award granted hereunder, and (iv) prescribe the form of
       the agreement, legend or other instrument necessary or advisable in the
       administration of awards under the Plan.

                                        E-1-10
<PAGE>


   (b) Terms and Conditions of Awards: Any restricted stock award granted
       under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Agreement
       executed by the Issuer and the recipient, in such form as the Committee
       shall approve, which agreement shall be subject to the following terms
       and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions
       not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee shall prescribe:

       (1) Number of Shares Subject to an Award: The Restricted Stock Agreement
           shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
           Award.

       (2) Restriction Period: The period of restriction applicable to each
           Award shall be established by the Committee but may not be less
           than one year. The Restriction Period applicable to each Award
           shall commence on the Award Date.

       (3) Consideration: Each recipient, as consideration for the grant of
           an award, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company for
           at least one year from the date of the granting of such award, and
           any shares covered by such an award shall lapse if the recipient
           does not remain in the continuous employ of the Company for at
           least one year from the date of the granting of the award.

       (4) Restriction Criteria: The Committee shall establish the criteria
           upon which the restriction period shall be based. Restrictions may
           be based upon either the continued employment of the recipient or
           upon the attainment by the Company of one or more of the following
           measures of the operating performance:

            a. Earnings                         d. Financial return ratios
            b. Revenue                          e. Total Shareholder Return
            c. Operating or net cash flows      f. Market share


       The Committee shall establish the specific targets for the selected
       criteria. These targets may be set at a specific level or may be
       expressed as relative to the comparable measure at comparison companies
       or a defined index. Performance objectives may be established in
       combination with restrictions based upon the continued employment of
       the recipient. These targets may be based upon the total Company or
       upon a defined business unit which the executive has responsibility
       for or influence over.

       In cases where objective performance criteria are established, the
       Committee shall determine the extent to which the criteria have been
       achieved and the corresponding level to which restrictions will be
       removed from the Award or the extent to which a participant's right to
       receive an Award should be lapsed in cases where the performance
       criteria have not been met and shall certify these determinations in
       writing. The Committee may provide for the determination of the
       attainment of such restrictions in installments where deemed
       appropriate.

   (c) Terms and Conditions of Restrictions and Forfeitures: The shares of
       Common Stock awarded pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to the
       following restrictions and conditions:

       (1) During the Restriction Period, the participant will not be permitted
           to sell, transfer, pledge or assign Restricted Stock awarded under
           this Plan.

       (2) Except as provided in Section 8(c)(i), or as the Committee may
           otherwise determine, the participant shall have all of the rights
           of a stockholder of the Issuer, including the right to vote the
           shares and receive dividends and other distributions provided that
           distributions in the form of stock shall be subject to the same
           restrictions as the underlying Restricted Stock.


                                     E-1-11
<PAGE>

       (3) In the event of a participant's retirement, death or disability
           prior to the end of the Restriction Period for a participant who
           has satisfied the one year employment requirement of Section
           7(c)(iii) with respect to an award prior to Retirement, death or
           Disability, the participant, or his/her estate, shall be entitled
           to receive that proportion (to the nearest whole share) of the
           number of shares subject to the Award granted as the number of
           months of the Restriction Period which have elapsed since the Award
           date to the date at which the participant's retirement, death or
           disability occurs, bears to the total number of months in the
           Restriction Period. The participant's right to receive any
           remaining shares shall be canceled and forfeited and the shares
           will be deemed to be reacquired by the Issuer.

       (4) In the event of a participant's retirement, death, disability or in
           cases of special circumstances as determined by the Committee, the
           Committee may, in its sole discretion when it finds that such an
           action would be in the best interests of the Company, accelerate or
           waive in whole or in part any or all remaining time based
           restrictions with respect to all or part of such participant's
           Restricted Stock.

       (5) Upon termination of employment for any reason during the
           restriction period, subject to the provisions of paragraph (iii)
           above or in the event that the participant fails promptly to pay
           or make satisfactory arrangements as to the withholding taxes as
           provided in the following paragraph, all shares still subject to
           restriction shall be forfeited by the participant and will be
           deemed to be reacquired by the Company.

       (6) A participant may, at any time prior to the expiration of the
           Restriction Period, waive all right to receive all or some of the
           shares of a Restricted Stock Award by delivering to the Company a
           written notice of such waiver.

       (7) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7, the
           Committee may adopt rules which would permit a gift by a participant
           of restricted shares to members of his/her immediate family (spouse,
           parents, children, stepchildren, grandchildren or legal dependants)
           or to a Trust whose beneficiary or beneficiaries shall be either
           such a person or persons or the participant.

       (8) Any attempt to dispose of Restricted Stock in a manner contrary to
           the restrictions shall be ineffective.

9. Determination of Breach of Conditions: The determination of the Committee
as to whether an event has occurred resulting in a forfeiture or a termination
or reduction of the Company's obligations in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan shall be conclusive.

10. Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock: In the event of changes in
the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of stock dividends,
recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, split-ups, combinations or exchanges
of shares and the like, the aggregate number and class of shares available
under the Plan, and the number, class and the price of shares subject to
outstanding options and/or awards and the number of performance units and/or
the dollar value of each unit shall be appropriately adjusted by the
Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive.

11. Taxes: Each participant shall, no later than the Tax Date (as defined
below), pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee
regarding payment of, any Withholding Tax (as defined below) with respect to
an Option or Award, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law,
have the right to deduct such amount from any payment of any kind otherwise
due to the participant. The Company shall also have the right to retain or
sell without notice, or to demand surrender of, shares of Common Stock in
value sufficient to cover the amount of any Withholding Tax (that is that
portion of any Applicable Tax, as defined below, required by any governmental
entity to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect to such
Award), and to make payment (or to reimburse itself for payment made) to the
appropriate taxing authority of an amount in cash equal to the amount of such

                              E-1-12
<PAGE>

Withholding Tax, remitting any balance to the participant. For purposes of
the paragraph, the value of shares of Common Stock so retained or surrendered
shall be the average of the high and low sales prices per share on the New
York Stock Exchange composite tape on the date that the amount of the
Withholding Tax is to be determined (the "Tax Date") and the value of
shares of Common Stock so sold shall be the actual net sale price per
share (after deduction of commissions) received by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the stock options have been transferred,
the optionee shall provide the Company with funds sufficient to pay such
Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.  Furthermore, if such optionee does not
satisfy his tax payment obligation and the stock options have been
transferred, the transferee may provide the funds sufficient to enable
the Company to pay such taxes.  However, if the stock options have been
transferred, the Company shall have no right to retain or sell without
notice, or to demand surrender from the transferee of, shares of Common
Stock in order to pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.

   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the participant shall be entitled to satisfy
the obligation to pay any Withholding Tax or to satisfy the obligation to pay
any tax to any governmental entity in respect of such Award, including any
Federal, state or local income tax up to an amount determined on the basis
of the highest marginal tax rate applicable to such participant, Federal
Insurance Contribution Act taxes or other governmental impost or levy (an
"Applicable Tax"), in whole or in part, by providing the Company with funds
sufficient to enable the Company to pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable
Tax or by requiring the Company to retain or to accept upon delivery thereof
by the participant shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value sufficient
to cover the amount of such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax or in a greater
amount as deemed appropriate by the Company. Each election by a participant to
have shares retained or to deliver shares for this purpose shall be subject to
the following restrictions: (i) the election must be in writing and be made on
or prior to the Tax Date; (ii) the election must be irrevocable; (iii) the
election shall be subject to the disapproval of the Committee.

12. Deferral Election: Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11, any
optionee or participant may elect, with the concurrence of the Committee
and consistent with any rules and regulations established by the Committee,
to defer the delivery of the proceeds of the exercise of any stock option
not transferred under the provisions of Section 6(b)(6) or stock appreciation
rights.

   (a) Election Timing: The election to defer the delivery of the proceeds
       from any eligible award must be made at least six months prior to the
       date such award is exercised or at such other time as the Committee may
       specify. Deferrals will only be allowed for exercises which occur
       while the optionee or participant is an active employee of the Company.
       Any election to defer the delivery of proceeds from an eligible award
       shall be irrevocable as long as the optionee or participant remains
       an employee of the Company.

   (b) Stock Option Deferral: The deferral of the proceeds of stock options
       may be elected by an optionee subject to the Regulations established
       by the Committee. The proceeds from such an exercise shall be credited
       to the optionee's deferred stock option account as the number of
       deferred share units equivalent in value to those proceeds. Deferred
       share units shall be valued at the Fair Market Value on the date of
       exercise. Subsequent to exercise, the deferred share units shall be
       valued at the Fair Market Value of Common Stock of the Company. Deferred
       share units shall accrue dividends at the rate paid upon the Company's
       Common Stock credited in the form of additional deferred share units.
       Deferred share units shall be distributed in shares of Company Stock
       upon the termination of employment of the participant or at such other
       date as may be approved by the Committee over a period of no more than
       10 years.

   (c) Stock Appreciation Right Deferral: Upon such exercise, the Company will
       credit the optionee's deferred stock option account with the number of
       deferred share units equivalent in value to the difference between the
       Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date and
       the exercise price of the Stock Appreciation Right multiplied by the
       number of shares exercised. Deferred share units shall be valued at
       the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise. Subsequent to exercise,

                                   E-1-13
<PAGE>

       the deferred share units shall be valued at the Fair Market Value of
       Common Stock of the Company. Deferred share units shall accrue
       dividends at the rate paid upon the Company's Common Stock credited
       in the form of additional deferred share units. Deferred share units
       shall be distributed in shares of Common Stock upon the termination of
       employment of the participant or at such other date as may be approved
       by the Committee over a period of no more than 10 years.

   (d) Accelerated Distributions: The Committee may, at its sole discretion,
       allow for the early payment of an optionee's or participant's deferred
       share units account in the event of an "unforeseeable emergency" or
       in the event of the death or disability of the optionee or participant.
       An "unforeseeable emergency" is defined as an unanticipated emergency
       caused by an event beyond the control of the optionee or participant
       that would result in severe financial hardship if the distribution were
       not permitted. Such distributions shall be limited to the amount
       necessary to sufficiently address the financial hardship. Any
       distributions under this provision shall be consistent with the
       Regulations established under the Code. Additionally, the Committee
       may use its discretion to cause deferred share unit accounts to be
       distributed when continuing the Program is no longer in the best
       interest of the Company.

   (e) Assignability: No rights to deferred share unit accounts may be
       assigned or subject to any encumbrance, pledge or charge of any nature
       except that an optionee or participant may designate a beneficiary
       pursuant to any rules established by the Committee.

13. Amendment of the Plan: The Board of Directors may amend or suspend the Plan
at any time and from time to time. No such amendment of the Plan may, however,
increase the maximum number of shares to be offered under options or awards,
or change the manner of determining the option price, or change the designation
of employees or class of employees eligible to receive options or awards, or
permit the transfer or issue of stock before payment therefor in full, or,
without the written consent of the optionee or participant, alter or impair
any option or award previously granted under the Plan or Prior Plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an option has been transferred in accordance
with Section 6(b)(6), written consent of the transferee (and not the optionee)
shall be necessary to alter or impair any option or award previously granted
under the Plan.

14. Miscellaneous:

   (a) By accepting any benefits under the Plan, each optionee or participant
       and each person claiming under or through such optionee or participant
       shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated acceptance and
       ratification of, and consent to, any action taken or made to be taken
       or made under the Plan by the Company, the Board, the Committee or any
       other Committee appointed by the Board.

   (b) No participant or any person claiming under or through him shall have
       any right or interest, whether vested or otherwise, in the Plan or
       in any option, or stock appreciation right or award thereunder,
       contingent or otherwise, unless and until all of the terms,
       conditions and provisions of the Plan and the Agreement that affect
       such participant or such other person shall have been complied with.

   (c) Nothing contained in the Plan or in any Agreement shall require the
       Company to segregate or earmark any cash or other property.

                                 E-1-14
<PAGE>


   (d) Neither the adoption of the Plan nor its operation shall in any
       way affect the rights and powers of the Company or any of its
       Subsidiaries or Affiliates to dismiss and/or discharge any employee
       at any time.

   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, neither the
       Board nor the Committee shall have any authority to take any action
       under the Plan where such action would affect the Company's ability to
       account for any business combination as a "pooling of interests."

15. Term of the Plan: The Plan, if approved by stockholders, will be
effective May 6, 1997. The Plan shall expire on May 31, 2002 unless suspended
or discontinued by action of the Board of Directors. The expiration of the
Plan, however, shall not affect the rights of Optionees under options
theretofore granted to them or the rights of participants under awards
theretofore granted to them, and all unexpired options and awards shall
continue in force and operation after termination of the Plan except as
they may lapse or be terminated by their own terms and conditions.

                      BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
                         1983 STOCK OPTION PLAN
              (as amended effective as of November 3, 1998)



1. Purpose:  The purpose of the 1983 Stock Option Plan (as amended effective
as of November 3, 1998) (the "Plan") is to secure for the Company and its
stockholders the benefits of the incentive inherent in common stock ownership
by the officers and key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates who will be largely responsible for the Company's future growth
and continued financial success and by providing long-term incentives in
addition to current compensation to certain key executives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates who contribute significantly to the long-term
performance and growth of the Company and such Subsidiaries and Affiliates.
It is intended that the former purpose will be effected through the grant of
stock options and stock appreciation rights under the Plan and that the latter
purpose will be effected through an award conditionally granting performance
units under the Plan, either independently or in conjunction with and related
to a nonqualified stock option grant under the Plan.  The Bristol-Myers
Squibb Company Long-Term Performance Award Plan (as amended to January 17,
1983 and in effect as of December 31, 1992) ("LTPAP") has been merged into
and consolidated with the Plan as of January 1, 1993.  As used herein, the
term "Prior Plan" shall mean the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company 1983 Stock
Option Plan (as amended through May 1, 1991 and in effect as of December 31,
1992) prior to its amendment and restatement as of January 1, 1993.

2. Definitions:  For purposes of this Plan:

   (a) "Affiliate" shall mean any entity in which the Company has an
        ownership interest of at least 20%.

   (b) "Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

   (c) "Common Stock" shall mean the Company's common stock (par value $.10
        per share).

   (d) "Company" shall mean Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

   (e) "Disability" or "Disabled" shall mean qualifying for and receiving
        payments under a disability pay plan of the Company or any Subsidiary
        or Affiliate.

   (f) "Exchange Act" shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
        amended.

   (g) "Fair Market Value" shall mean the average of the high and low sale
        prices of a share of Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
        composite tape on the date of measurement or on any date as determined
        by the Committee and if there were no trades on such date, on the day
        on which a trade occurred next preceding such date.

   (h) "Retirement" shall mean termination of the employment of an employee
        with the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate on or after (i) the
        employee's 65th birthday or (ii) the employee's 55th birthday if the
        employee has completed 10 years of service with the Company, its
        Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates.  For purposes of this Section 2(h)
        and all other purposes of this Plan, Retirement shall also mean
        termination of employment of an employee with the Company or a
        Subsidiary or Affiliate for any reason (other than the employee's
        death, disability, resignation, willful misconduct or activity deemed
        detrimental to the interests of the Company) where, on termination,
        the employee's age plus years of service (rounded up to the next
        higher whole number) equals at least 70 and the employee has completed
        10 years of service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its
        Affiliates.

   Furthermore, an employee who makes an election to retire under Article 19
   of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan (the "Retirement
   Income Plan") shall have any additional years of age and service which are
   credited under Article 19 of the Retirement Income Plan taken into account
   when determining such employee's age and service under this Section 2(h).
   Such election shall be deemed a Retirement for purposes of this Section 2(h)
   and all other purposes of this Plan.

                                   E-2-1

       (i) "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation which at the time qualifies
           as a subsidiary of the Company under the definition of "subsidiary
           corporation" in Section 424 of the Code.

3. Amount of Stock:  The amount of stock which may be made subject to grants
of options or awards of performance units under the Plan in calendar year 1993
shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) 0.9% of the outstanding shares of the
Company's Common Stock on January 1, 1993, plus (ii) the amount of shares
available for, and not made subject to, grants of options under the Prior Plan
as of January 1, 1993, less (iii) the number of shares subject to options
granted in 1993 under the Prior Plan and (iv) the number of shares
corresponding to awards of performance units outstanding under the LTPAP on
the date the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company.  With
respect to each succeeding year, the amount of stock which may be made subject
to grants of options or awards of performance units under the Plan shall not
exceed an amount equal to (i) 0.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company's
Common Stock on January 1 of such year plus, subject to this Section 3, (ii)
in any year the number of shares equal to the amount of shares that were
available for grants and awards in the prior year but were not made subject
to a grant or award in such prior year and (iii) the number of shares that
were subject to options or awards granted hereunder or under the Prior Plan,
which options or awards terminated or expired in the prior year without being
exercised.  Common Stock issued hereunder may be authorized and reissued shares
or issued shares acquired by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the market or
otherwise.

4. Administration:  The Plan shall be administered under the supervision of
the Board of Directors of the Company which shall exercise its powers, to the
extent herein provided, through the agency of a Compensation and Management
Development Committee (the "Committee") which shall be appointed by the Board
of Directors of the Company and shall consist of not less than three directors
who shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.  No member of the Committee
shall have been within one year prior to appointment to, or while serving
on, the Committee granted or awarded equity securities of the Company pursuant
to this or any other plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
except to the extent that participation in any such plan or receipt of any
such grant or award would not adversely affect the Committee member's status
as a non-employee director for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

   The Committee, from time to time, may adopt rules and regulations for
carrying out the provisions and purposes of the Plan and make such other
determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee
shall deem appropriate.  The interpretation and construction of any provision
of the Plan by the Committee shall, unless otherwise determined by the Board
of Directors, be final and conclusive.

   The Committee shall maintain a written record of its proceedings.  A
majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and the acts of a
majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present,
or acts unanimously approved in writing, shall be the acts of the Committee.

5. Eligibility:  Options and awards may be granted only to present or future
officers and key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
including Subsidiaries and Affiliates which become such after the adoption of
the Plan.  Any officer or key employee of the Company or of any such
Subsidiary or Affiliate shall be eligible to receive one or more options
or awards under the Plan.  Any director who is not an officer or employee
of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and any member of
the Committee, during the time of the member's service as such or thereafter,
shall be ineligible to receive an option or award under the Plan.  The
adoption of this Plan shall not be deemed to give any officer or employee
any right to an award or to be granted an option to purchase Common Stock
of the Company, except to the extent and upon such terms and conditions as
may be determined by the Committee.


                                E-2-2
<PAGE>

6. Stock Options:  Stock options under the Plan shall consist of incentive
stock options under Section 422 of the Code or nonqualified stock options
(options not intended to qualify as incentive stock options), as the Committee
shall determine.  In addition, the Committee may grant stock appreciation
rights in conjunction with an option, as set forth in Section 6(b)(11), or
may grant awards in conjunction with an option, as set forth in Section
6(b)(10) (an "Associated Option").

   Each option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

   (a) Grant of Options.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and
       key employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom
       options may from time to time be granted, (2) determine whether
       incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, are to be
       granted, (3) determine the number of shares to be covered by each
       option so granted, (4) determine the terms and conditions (not
       inconsistent with the Plan) of any option granted hereunder (including
       but not limited to restrictions upon the options, conditions of their
       exercise, or on the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
       thereof), (5) determine whether nonqualified stock options or incentive
       stock options granted under the Plan shall include stock appreciation
       rights and, if so, shall determine the terms and conditions thereof in
       accordance with Section 6(b)(11) hereof, (6) determine whether any
       nonqualified stock options granted under the Plan shall be Associated
       Options, and (7) prescribe the form of the instruments necessary or
       advisable in the administration of options.

   (b) Terms and Conditions of Option.  Any option granted under the Plan
       shall be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement executed by the Company
       and the optionee, in such form as the Committee shall approve, which
       agreement shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and
       shall contain such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent
       with the Plan, and in the case of an incentive stock option not
       inconsistent with the provisions of the Code applicable to incentive
       stock options, as the Committee shall prescribe:

       (1) Number of Shares Subject to an Option.  The Stock Option Agreement
           shall specify the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
           Agreement.  If the option is an Associated Option, the number of
           shares of Common Stock subject to such Associated Option shall
           initially be equal to the number of performance units subject to the
           award, but one share of Common Stock shall be canceled for each
           performance unit paid out under the award.

       (2) Option Price.  The purchase price per share of Common Stock
           purchasable under an option will be determined by the Committee
           but will be not less than the Fair Market Value of a share of
           Common Stock on the date of the grant of such option.

       (3) Option Period.  The period of each option shall be fixed by
           the Committee, but no option shall be exercisable after the
           expiration of ten years from the date the option is granted.

       (4) Consideration.  Each optionee, as consideration for the grant of
           an option, shall remain in the continuous employ of the Company or
           of one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least one year
           from the date of the granting of such option, and no option shall
           be exercisable until after the completion of such one year period
           of employment by the optionee.

       (5) Exercise of Option.  An option may be exercised in whole or in part
           from time to time during the option period (or, if determined by
           the Committee, in specified installments during the option period)
           by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the
           number of shares to be purchased, such notice to be accompanied by
           payment in full of the purchase price and Withholding Taxes (as
           defined in Section 10 hereof) due either by certified or bank
           check, or in shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by the
           optionee having a Fair Market Value at the date of exercise equal
           to such purchase price and Withholding Taxes due, or in a
           combination of the foregoing; provided, however, that payment in
           shares of Common Stock of the Company will not be permitted unless
           at least 100 shares of Common Stock are required and delivered for
           such purpose.  No shares shall be issued until full payment
           therefor has been made.  An optionee shall have the rights of a
           stockholder only with respect to shares of stock for which
           certificates have been issued to the optionee.


                                        E-2-3
<PAGE>

       (6) Nontransferability of Options.  No option or stock appreciation
           right granted under the Plan shall be transferable by the optionee
           otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution,
           and such option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable,
           during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may set forth in a
           Stock Option Agreement at the time of grant or thereafter, that the
           options may be transferred to members of the optionee's immediate
           family, to trusts solely for the benefit of such immediate family
           members and to partnerships in which such family members and/or
           trusts are the only partners.  For this purpose, immediate family
           members means the optionee's spouse, parents, children,
           stepchildren, grandchildren and legal dependents.  Any transfer
           of options made under this provision will not be effective until
           notice of such transfer is delivered to the Company.

       (7) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other than by Death or
           Disability.  If an optionee shall cease to be employed by the
           Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any reason
           (other than termination of employment by reason of death or
           Disability) after the optionee shall have been continuously so
           employed for one year after the granting of the option, the option
           shall be exercisable only to the extent that the optionee was
           otherwise entitled to exercise it at the time of such cessation
           of employment with the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, but in
           no event after the expiration of the option period set forth
           therein except that in the case of cessation of employment other
           than by reason of Retirement or death, the option shall in no
           event be exercisable after the date three months next succeeding
           such cessation of employment.  The Plan does not confer upon
           any optionee any right with respect to continuation of employment
           by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

       (8) Disability of Optionee.  An optionee who ceases to be employed
           by reason of Disability shall be treated as though the optionee
           remained in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate
           until the earlier of (i) cessation of payments under a disability
           pay plan of the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate, (ii) the
           optionee's death, or (iii) the optionee's 65th birthday.

       (9) Death of Optionee. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (13),
           in the event of the optionee's death (i) while in the employ of the
           Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) while
           Disabled as described in subsection (8) or (iii) after cessation
           of employment due to Retirement, the option shall be fully
           exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees or
           distributees of the optionee's estate, as the case may be, at any
           time following such death.  In the event of the optionee's death
           after cessation of employment for any reason other than Disability
           or Retirement, the option shall be exercisable by the executors,
           administrators, legatees or distributees of the optionee's estate,
           as the case may be, at any time during the twelve month period
           following such death.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
           shall an option be exercisable unless the optionee shall have
           been continuously employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
           or Affiliates for a period of at least one year after the option
           grant, and no option shall be exercisable after the expiration of
           the option period set forth in the Stock Option Agreement.  In the
           event any option is exercised by the executors, administrators,
           legatees or distributees of the estate of a deceased optionee,
           the Company shall be under no obligation to issue stock thereunder
           unless and until the Company is satisfied that the person or
           persons exercising the option are the duly appointed legal
           representatives of the deceased optionee's estate or the proper
           legatees or distributees thereof.

       (10) Long Term Performance Awards.  The Committee may from time to time
           grant nonqualified stock options under the Plan in conjunction with
           and related to an award of performance units made under a Long Term
           Performance Award as set forth in Section 7(b)(11).  In such event,
           notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (i) the number of
           shares to which the Associated Option applies shall initially be
           equal to the number of performance units granted by the award, but
           such number of shares shall be reduced on a one share-for-one unit
           basis to the extent that the Committee determines pursuant to the
           terms of the award, to pay to the optionee or the optionee's
           beneficiary the performance units granted pursuant to such award;
           and (ii) such Associated Option shall be cancelable in the
           discretion of the Committee, without the consent of the optionee,
           under the conditions and to the extent specified in the award.


                                    E-2-4

       (11) Stock Appreciation Rights.  In the case of any option granted
           under the Plan, either at the time of grant or by amendment of such
           option at any time after such grant there may be included a stock
           appreciation right which shall be subject to such terms and
           conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee
           shall impose, including the following:

           (A) A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable to the extent,
               and only to the extent, that the option in which it is included
               is at the time exercisable, and may be exercised within such
               period only at such time or times as may be determined by
               the Committee;

           (B) A stock appreciation right shall entitle the optionee (or any
               person entitled to act under the provisions of subsection (9)
               hereof) to surrender unexercised the option in which the stock
               appreciation right is included (or any portion of such option)
               to the Company and to receive from the Company in exchange
               therefor that number of shares having an aggregate value equal
               to (or, in the discretion of the Committee, less than) the
               excess of the value of one share (provided such value does not
               exceed such multiple of the option price per share as may be
               specified by the Committee) over the option price per share
               specified in such option times the number of shares called for
               by the option, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered.  The
               Committee shall be entitled to cause the Company to settle its
               obligation, arising out of the exercise of a stock appreciation
               right, by the payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of
               the shares the Company would otherwise be obligated to deliver
               or partly by the payment of cash and partly by the delivery
               of shares.  Any such election shall be made within 30 business
               days after the receipt by the Committee of written notice of
               the exercise of the stock appreciation right.  The value of a
               share for this purpose shall be the Fair Market Value thereof
               on the last business day preceding the date of the election to
               exercise the stock appreciation right;

           (C) No fractional shares shall be delivered under this subsection
               (11) but in lieu thereof a cash adjustment shall be made;

           (D) If a stock appreciation right included in an option is
               exercised, such option shall be deemed to have been exercised
               to the extent of the number of shares called for by the option
               or portion thereof which is surrendered on exercise of the
               stock appreciation right and no new option may be granted
               covering such shares under this Plan; and

           (E) If an option which includes a stock appreciation right is
               exercised, such stock appreciation right shall be deemed to
               have been canceled to the extent of the number of shares called
               for by the option or portion thereof is exercised and no new
               stock appreciation rights may be granted covering such shares
               under this Plan.

       (12) Incentive Stock Options.  In the case of any incentive stock
            option granted under the Plan, the aggregate Fair Market Value of
            the shares of Common Stock of the Company (determined at the time
            of grant of each option) with respect to which incentive stock
            options granted under the Plan and any other plan of the Company
            or its parent or a Subsidiary which are exercisable for the first
            time by an employee during any calendar year shall not exceed
            $100,000 or such other amount as may be required by the Code.
            In any year, the maximum number of shares with respect to which
            incentive stock options may be granted shall not exceed 4,000,000
            shares.

       (13) Rights of Transferee.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
            herein, if an option has been transferred in accordance with
            Section 6(b)(6), the option shall be exercisable solely by the
            transferee.  The option shall remain subject to the provisions of
            the Plan, including that it will be exercisable only to the extent
            that the optionee or optionee's estate would have been entitled
            to exercise it if the optionee had not transferred the option.
            In the event of the death of the optionee prior to the expiration
            of the right to exercise the transferred option, the period during
            which the option shall be exercisable will terminate on the date
            one year following the date of the optionee's death.  In the event
            of the death of the transferee prior to the expiration of the right
            to exercise the option, the period during which the option shall
            be exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees and
            distributees of the transferee's estate, as the case may be, will

                                         E-2-5
<PAGE>

            terminate on the date one year following the date of the
            transferee's death.  In no event will the option be exercisable
            after the expiration of the option period set forth in the Stock
            Option Agreement.  The option shall be subject to such other rules
            as the Committee shall determine.

7. Long-term Performance Awards:  Awards under the Plan shall consist of the
conditional grant to the participants of a specified number of performance
units.  The conditional grant of a performance unit to a participant will
entitle the participant to receive a specified dollar value, variable under
conditions specified in the award, if the performance objectives specified
in the award are achieved and the other terms and conditions thereof are
satisfied.

   Each award will be subject to the following terms and conditions:

   (a) Grant of Awards.  The Committee shall (1) select the officers and key
       executives of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to whom
       awards may from time to time be granted, (2) determine the number of
       performance units covered by each award, (3) determine the terms and
       conditions of each performance unit awarded and the award period and
       performance objectives with respect to each award, (4) determine the
       periods during which a participant may request the Committee to approve
       deferred payment of a percentage (50% or 100%) of an award (the
       "Deferred Portion") and the interest or rate of return thereon or the
       basis on which such interest or rate of return thereon is to be
       determined, (5) determine whether payment with respect to the portion
       of an award which has not been deferred (the "Current Portion") and the
       payment with respect to the Deferred Portion of an award shall be made
       entirely in cash, entirely in Common Stock or partially in cash and
       partially in Common Stock, (6) determine whether the award is to be
       made independently of or in conjunction with a nonqualified stock
       option granted under the Plan, and (7) prescribe the form of the
       instruments necessary or advisable in the administration of the awards.

   (b) Terms and Conditions of Award.  Any award conditionally granting
       performance units to a participant shall be evidenced by a Performance
       Unit Agreement executed by the Company and the participant, in such
       form as the Committee shall approve, which Agreement shall contain
       in substance the following terms and conditions and such additional
       terms and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe:

       (1) Number of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall
           specify the number of performance units conditionally granted to
           the participant.  If the award has been made in conjunction with
           the grant of an Associated Option, the number of performance units
           granted shall initially be equal to the number of shares which the
           participant is granted the right to purchase pursuant to the
           Associated Option, but one performance unit shall be canceled for
           each share of the Company's Common Stock purchased upon exercise of
           the Associated Option or for each stock appreciation right included
           in such option that has been exercised.

       (2) Value of Performance Units.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall
           specify the threshold, target and maximum dollar values of each
           performance unit and corresponding performance objectives as
           provided under Section 7(b)(5).

       (3) Award Periods.  For each award, the Committee shall designate an
           award period with a duration to be determined by the Committee
           in its discretion but in no event less than three calendar years
           within which specified performance objectives are to be attained.
           There may be several award periods in existence at any one time
           and the duration of performance objectives may differ from each
           other.


                                    E-2-6
<PAGE>

       (4) Consideration.  Each participant, as consideration for the award
           of performance units, shall remain in the continuous employ of the
           Company or of one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for at least
           one year after the date of the making of such award, and no award
           shall be payable until after the completion of such one year of
           employment by the participant.

       (5) Performance Objectives.  The Committee shall establish performance
           objectives with respect to the Company for each award period on the
           basis of such criteria and to accomplish such objectives as the
           Committee may from time to time determine.  Performance objectives
           may include objective and subjective criteria.  During any award
           period, the Committee may adjust the performance objectives for
           such award period as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual
           or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, changes in applicable
           tax laws or accounting principles, or such other factors as the
           Committee may determine.

       (6) Determination and Payment of Performance Units Earned.  As soon as
           practicable after the end of an award period, the Committee shall
           determine the extent to which awards have been earned on the basis
           of the Company's actual performance in relation to the established
           performance objectives as set forth in the Performance Unit
           Agreement.  The Performance Unit Agreement shall specify that as
           soon as practicable after the end of each award period, the
           Committee shall determine whether the conditions of Sections 7(b)(4)
           and 7(b)(5) hereof have been met and, if so, shall ascertain the
           amount payable to the participant in respect of the performance
           units.  As promptly as practicable after it has determined that an
           amount is payable in respect of an award, the Committee shall cause
           the Current Portion of such award to be paid to the participant or
           the participant's beneficiaries, as the case may be, in the
           Committee's discretion, either entirely in cash, entirely in Common
           Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common Stock.  The
           Deferred Portion of an award shall be contingently credited and
           payable to the participant over a deferred period and shall be
           credited with interest or a rate of return, as determined by the
           Committee.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall determine the
           conditions upon, and method of, payment of such deferred portions
           and whether such payment will be made entirely in cash, entirely in
           Common Stock or partially in cash and partially in Common Stock.

       In making the payment of an award in Common Stock hereunder, the cash
       equivalent of such Common Stock shall be determined by the Fair Market
       Value of the Common Stock on the day the Committee designates the
       performance units shall be paid.

       (7) Nontransferability of Awards and Designation of Beneficiaries.  No
           award under the Plan shall be transferable by the participant other
           than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, except
           that a participant may designate a beneficiary pursuant to the
           provisions hereof.

       If any participant or the participant's beneficiary shall attempt to
       assign the participant's rights under the Plan in violation of the
       provisions thereof, the Company's obligation to make any further
       payments to such participant or the participant's beneficiaries shall
       forthwith terminate.

       A participant may name one or more beneficiaries to receive any payment
       of an award to which the participant may be entitled under the Plan
       in the event of the participant's death, on a form to be provided by
       the Committee.  A participant may change the participant's beneficiary
       designation from time to time in the same manner.

       If no designated beneficiary is living on the date on which any payment
       becomes payable to a participant's beneficiary, such payment will be
       payable to the person or persons in the first of the following classes
       of successive preference:

           (i)   Widow or widower, if then living,
           (ii)  Surviving children, equally,
           (iii) Surviving parents, equally,
           (iv)  Surviving brothers and sisters, equally,
           (v)   Executors or administrators


                              E-2-7
<PAGE>

       and the term "beneficiary" as used in the Plan shall include such
       person or persons.


       (8) Retirement and Termination of Employment Other Than by Death or
           Disability.  In the event of the Retirement prior to the end of
           an award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year
           employment requirement of Section 7(b)(4) with respect to an
           award prior to Retirement, the participant, or his estate, shall
           be entitled to a payment of such award at the end of the award
           period, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the participant's
           Performance Unit Agreement, provided, however, that the participant
           shall be deemed to have earned that proportion (to the nearest
           whole unit) of the value of the performance units granted to the
           participant under such award as the number of months of the award
           period which have elapsed since the first day of the calendar year
           in which the award was made to the end of the month in which the
           participant's Retirement occurs, bears to the total number of
           months in the award period.  The participant's rights in any
           remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

       Subject to Section 7(b)(6) hereof, the Performance Unit Agreement
       shall specify that the rights of the participant in the performance
       units granted to such participant shall be conditional and shall be
       canceled, forfeited and surrendered if the participant's continuous
       employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall
       terminate for any reason, other than the participant's death,
       Disability or Retirement prior to the end of the award period.

       The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part,
       the cancellation, forfeiture and surrender of any performance units.

       (9) Disability of Participant.  For the purposes of any award a
           participant  who becomes Disabled shall be deemed to have suspended
           active employment by reason of Disability commencing on the date
           the participant becomes entitled to receive payments under a
           disability pay plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
           and continuing until the date the participant is no longer entitled
           to receive such payments.  In the event a participant becomes
           Disabled during an award period but only if the participant has
           satisfied the one year employment requirement of Section 7(b)(4)
           with respect to an award prior to becoming Disabled, upon the
           determination by the Committee of the extent to which an award has
           been earned pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) the participant shall be
           deemed to have earned that proportion (to the nearest whole unit)
           of the value of the performance units granted to the participants
           under such award as the number of months of the award period in
           which the participant was not Disabled bears to the total number of
           months of the award period.  The participant's rights in any
           remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

       The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such
       cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.

       (10) Death of Participant.  In the event of the death prior to the end
            of an award period of a participant who has satisfied the one year
            employment requirement with respect to an award prior to the date
            of death, the participant's beneficiaries or estate, as the case
            may be, shall be entitled to a payment of such award upon the end
            of the award period, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the
            participant's Performance Unit Agreement, provided, however, that
            the participant shall be deemed to have earned that proportion
            (to the nearest whole unit) of the value of the performance units
            granted to the participant under such award as the number of months
            of the award period which have elapsed since the first day of the
            calendar year in which the award was made to the end of the month
            in which the participant's death occurs, bears to the total number
            of months in the award period.  The participant's rights in any
            remaining performance units shall be canceled and forfeited.

       The Committee may, in its discretion, waive, in whole or in part, such
       cancellation and forfeiture of any performance units.


                                       E-2-8
<PAGE>

       (11) Grant of Associated Option.  If the Committee determines that the
            conditional grant of performance units under the Plan is to be made
            to a participant in conjunction with the grant of a nonqualified
            stock option under the Plan, the Committee shall grant the
            participant an Associated Option under the Plan subject to the
            terms and conditions of this subsection (11).  In such event,
            such award under the Plan shall be contingent upon the
            participant's being granted such an Associated Option pursuant
            to which:  (i) the number of shares the optionee may purchase
            shall initially be equal to the number of performance units
            conditionally granted by the award, (ii) such number of shares
            shall be reduced on a one share-for-one unit basis to the extent
            that the Committee determines, pursuant to Section 7(b)(6) hereof,
            to pay to the participant or the participant's beneficiaries the
            performance units conditionally granted pursuant to the award, and
            (iii) the Associated Option shall be cancelable in the discretion
            of the Committee, without the consent of the participant, under
            the conditions and to the extent specified herein and in
            Section 7(b)(6) hereof.

       If no amount is payable in respect of the conditionally granted
       performance units, the award and such performance units shall be deemed
       to have been canceled, forfeited and surrendered, and the Associated
       Option, if any, shall continue in effect in accordance with its terms.
       If any amount is payable in respect of the performance units and such
       units were granted in conjunction with an Associated Option, the
       Committee shall, within 30 days after the determination of the
       Committee referred to in the first sentence of Section 7(b)(6),
       determine, in its sole discretion, either:

           (A) to cancel in full the Associated Option, in which event the
               value of the performance units payable pursuant to Sections
               7(b)(5) and (6) shall be paid;

           (B) to cancel in full the performance units, in which event no
               amount shall be paid to the participant in respect thereof but
               the Associated Option shall continue in effect in accordance
               with its terms; or

           (C) to cancel some, but not all, of the performance units, in which
               event the value of the performance units payable pursuant to
               Sections 7(b)(5) and (6) which have not been canceled shall be
               paid and the Associated Option shall be canceled with respect
               to that number of shares equal to the number of conditionally
               granted performance units that remain payable.

           Any action taken by the Committee pursuant to the preceding
           sentence shall be uniform with respect to all awards having the
           same award period.  If the Committee takes no such action, it
           shall be deemed to have determined to cancel in full the award
           in accordance with clause (B) above.

8. Determination of Breach of Conditions:  The determination of the Committee
as to whether an event has occurred resulting in a forfeiture or a termination
or reduction of the Company's obligations in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan shall be conclusive.

9. Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock:  In the event of changes in
the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of stock dividends,
recapitalization, mergers, consolidations, split-ups, combinations or
exchanges of shares and the like, the aggregate number and class of shares
available under the Plan, and the number, class and the price of shares
subject to outstanding options and/or awards and the number of performance
units and/or the dollar value of each unit shall be appropriately adjusted
by the Committee, whose determination shall be conclusive.

10. Taxes:  In connection with the transfer of shares of Common Stock to an
optionee, subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as the result of the
exercise of a nonqualified stock option or a stock appreciation right, or
to a participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, upon payment of
an award, the Company shall have the right to retain or sell without notice,
or to demand surrender of, shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value
(taking into account any commissions or other expenses the Company may incur
upon the sale of such shares) on the date that the amount required by any
governmental entity to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid with respect
to such transfer ("Withholding Tax") is to be determined (the "Tax Date")
sufficient to cover the amount of any Applicable Tax (the amount of W
ithholding Tax plus the incremental amount determined on the basis of the
highest marginal tax rate applicable to such optionee or participant, Federal
Insurance Contribution Act taxes or other governmental impost or levy), and
to make payment (or to reimburse itself for payment made) to the appropriate
taxing authority of an amount in cash equal to the amount of such Applicable
Tax, remitting any balance to the optionee or participant.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the stock options have been transferred, the optionee shall
provide the Company with funds sufficient to pay such Withholding or
Applicable Tax.  Furthermore, if such optionee does not satisfy his

                              E-2-9
<PAGE>

withholding obligation, the transferee may provide the funds sufficient to
enable the Company to pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax.  However,
if the stock options have been transferred, the Company shall have no right
to retain or sell without notice, or to demand surrender from the transferee
of, shares of Common Stock in order to pay such Withholding Tax or Applicable
Tax.

   An optionee or participant who is not an executive officer of the Company
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be entitled to satisfy the
obligation to pay any Withholding Tax or Applicable Tax, by providing the
Company with funds sufficient to enable the Company to pay such Withholding
Tax or Applicable Tax or by requiring the Company to retain or to accept upon
delivery thereof by the optionee or participant shares of Common Stock
sufficient in value (determined in accordance with the last sentence of the
preceding paragraph), to cover the amount of such Withholding Tax or
Applicable Tax.  Each election by an optionee or participant to have shares
retained or to deliver shares for this purpose shall be subject to the
following restrictions:  (i) the election must be in writing and be made
on or prior to the Tax Date; (ii) the election must be irrevocable; (iii)
the election shall be subject to the disapproval of the Committee.

11. Amendment of the Plan: The Board of Directors may amend or suspend the
Plan at any time and from time to time.  No such amendment of the Plan may,
however, increase the maximum number of shares to be offered under options or
awards, or change the manner of determining the option price, or change the
designation of employees or class of employees eligible to receive options
or awards, or permit the transfer or issue of stock before payment therefor
in full, or, without the written consent of the optionee or participant,
alter or impair any option or award previously granted under the Plan, Prior
Plan or LTPAP.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an option has been
transferred in accordance with Section 6(b)(6), written consent of the
transferee (and not the optionee) shall be necessary to alter or impair any
option or award previously granted under the Plan.

12. Amendment of Options Outstanding Under the Prior Plan:  The Prior Plan and
certain nonqualified options granted and outstanding thereunder are hereby
amended to provide that any nonqualified option which is outstanding on the
date this Plan is adopted by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
of the Company's Common Stock and $2.00 Convertible Preferred Stock present in
person or by proxy at a duly held shareholders meeting at which a quorum
representing a majority of all outstanding voting stock is present shall be
exercisable in accordance with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(b)(9), except that for
the purpose of such options "Retirement" shall additionally mean termination
of the employment of an employee after completing 35 years of service with
the Company or its Subsidiaries.

   Furthermore, an employee who makes an election to retire under Article 19
of the Retirement Income Plan shall have any additional years of age and
service which are credited under Article 19 of the Retirement Income Plan
taken into account when determining such employee's age and years of service
with the Company or its Subsidiaries under this Section 12.  Such election
shall be deemed a Retirement for purposes of this Section 12 and all other
purposes of this Plan.

13. Miscellaneous:  By accepting any benefits under the Plan, each optionee
or participant and each person claiming under or through such optionee or
participant shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated acceptance and
ratification of, and consent to, any action taken or made to be taken or made
under the Plan by the Company, the Board, the Committee or any other Committee
appointed by the Board.  No participant or any person claiming under or
through him shall have any right or interest, whether vested or otherwise,
in the Plan or in any option, or stock appreciation right or award thereunder,
contingent or otherwise, unless and until all of the terms, conditions and
provisions of the Plan and the Agreement that affect such participant or such
other person shall have been complied with.  Nothing contained in the Plan or
in any Agreement shall require the Company to segregate or earmark any cash or
other property.  Neither the adoption of the Plan nor its operation shall in
any way affect the rights and powers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to dismiss and/or discharge any employee at any time.


                                E-2-10
<PAGE>

14. Term of the Plan:  The Plan shall become effective as of January 1, 1993
by action of the Board of Directors conditioned on and subject to approval of
the Plan, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock
and $2.00 Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company present in person or by
proxy at a duly held shareholders meeting at which a quorum representing a
majority of all outstanding voting stock is present.  The Plan shall terminate
on December 31, 2002, or at such earlier date as may be determined by the
Board of Directors.  Termination of the Plan, however, shall not affect the
rights of optionees under options theretofore granted to them or the rights
of participants under awards theretofore granted to them, and all unexpired
options and awards shall continue in force and operation after termination
of the Plan except as they may lapse or be terminated by their own terms
and conditions.

                        BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
                 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK OPTION PLAN

                    AMENDED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 12, 1999



1. Purpose:

The purpose of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Non-Employee Directors' Stock
Option Plan ("the Plan") is to secure for Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
("the Company") and its stockholders the benefits of the incentive inherent
in increased common stock ownership by the members of the Board of Directors
("the Board") of the Company who are Eligible Directors as defined in the Plan.


2. Administration:

The Plan shall be administered by the Board.  The Board shall have all the
powers vested in it by the terms of the Plan, such powers to include authority
(within the limitations described herein) to prescribe the form of the
agreement embodying awards of stock options made under the Plan ("Options").
The Board shall, subject to the provisions of the Plan, grant Options under
the Plan and shall have the power to construe the Plan, to determine all
questions arising thereunder and to adopt and amend such rules and regulations
for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable.  Any decision of
the Board in the administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall be
final and conclusive.  The Board may act only by a majority of its members in
office, except that the members thereof may authorize any one or more of their
number or the Secretary or any other officer of the Company to execute and
deliver documents on behalf of the Board.  No member of the Board shall be
liable for anything done or omitted to be done by such member or by any other
member of the Board in connection with the Plan, except for such member's own
willful misconduct or as expressly provided by statute.


3. Amount of Stock:

The stock which may be issued and sold under the Plan will be the Common
Stock (par value $.10 per share) of the Company, of a total number not
exceeding 500,000 shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph
6 below.  The stock to be issued may be either authorized and unissued
shares or issued shares acquired by the Company or its subsidiaries.  In
the event that Options granted under the Plan shall terminate or expire
without being exercised in whole or in part, new Options may be granted
covering the shares not purchased under such lapsed Options.


4. Eligible Directors:

The members of the Board who are eligible to participate in the Plan are
persons who serve as directors of the Company after the effective date of
the Plan and:


                                E-3-1
<PAGE>

   (a) who are not current or former employees of the Company and

   (b) who are not and, in the past, have not been eligible to receive Options
       on Company stock by participation as an employee in another plan
       sponsored by the Company or under a contractual arrangement with the
       Company.


5.  Terms and Conditions of Options:

Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an agreement in such
form as the Board shall prescribe from time to time in accordance with the
Plan and shall comply with the following terms and conditions:

   (a) The Option exercise price shall be the fair market value of the Common
       Stock shares subject to such Option on the date the Option is granted,
       which shall be the average of the high and the low sales prices of a
       Common Stock share on the date of grant as reported on the New York
       Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Tape or, if the New York Stock
       Exchange is closed on that date, on the last preceding date on which
       the New York Stock Exchange was open for trading.

   (b) Each year, as of the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the
       Company, each Eligible Director who has been elected or reelected or
       who is continuing as a member of the Board as of the adjournment of
       the Annual Meeting shall automatically receive an Option for 2,500
       shares of Common Stock on a post-split basis.

   (c) The Option shall not be transferable by the optionee otherwise than by
       will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable
       during his lifetime only by him.

   (d) No Option or any part of an Option shall be exercisable:

       (I) before the Eligible Director has served one term-year as a member
           of the Board since the date the Option was granted (as used herein,
           the term "term-year" means that period from one Annual Meeting to
           the subsequent Annual Meeting),

          (ii) after the expiration of ten years from the date the Option was
               granted,

          (iii) unless, written notice of the exercise is delivered to the
               Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased and
               payment in full is made for the shares of Common Stock being
               acquired thereunder at the time of exercise; such payment shall
               be made

               (A) in United States dollars by certified check, or bank draft
                   or


                                      E-3-2
<PAGE>

               (B) by tendering to the Company Common Stock shares owned by the
                   person exercising the Option and having a fair market value
                   equal to the cash exercise price applicable to such Option,
                   such fair market value to be the average of the high and
                   low sales prices of a Common Stock share on the date of
                   exercise as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
                   Composite Transactions Tape, or, if the New York Stock
                   Exchange is closed on that date, on the last preceding date
                   on which the New York Stock Exchange was open for trading,
                   or

                   by a combination of United States dollars and Common Stock
                   shares as aforesaid; and

          (iv) unless the person exercising the Option has been, at all times
               during the period beginning with the date of grant of the Option
               and ending on the date of such exercise, an Eligible Director
               of the Company, except that

               (A) if such a person shall cease to be such an Eligible Director
                   for reasons other than retirement or death, while holding an
                   Option that has not expired and has not been fully
                   exercised, such person, at any time within one year after
                   the date he ceases to be such an Eligible Director (but in
                   no event after the Option has expired under the provisions
                   of subparagraph 5(d) (ii) above), may exercise the Option
                   with respect to any Common Stock shares as to which such
                   person has not exercised the Option on the date the person
                   ceased to be such an Eligible Director; or

               (B) if such person shall cease to be such an Eligible Director
                   by reason of retirement or death while holding an Option
                   that has not expired and has not been fully exercised, such
                   person, or in the case of death, the executors,
                   administrators or distributees, as the case may be, may at
                   any time within five years after the date such person ceased
                   to be such an Eligible Director (but in no event after the
                   Option has expired under the provisions of subparagraph 5(d)
                   (ii) above), exercise the Option with respect to any shares
                   of Common Stock as to which such person has not exercised
                   the Option on the date the person ceased to be such an
                   Eligible Director, notwithstanding the provisions of
                   subparagraph 5(e) below.

                   if any person who has ceased to be such an Eligible
                   Director for reasons other than death, shall die holding
                   an Option that has not been fully exercised, such person's
                   executors, administrators, heirs or distributees, as the
                   case may be, may, at any time within the greater of (1) one
                   year after the date of death or (2) the remainder for the
                   period in which such person could have exercised the Option
                   had the person not died, (but in no event (under either (1)
                   or (2) after the Option has expired under the provisions of
                   subparagraph 5(d) (ii) above)), exercise the Option with
                   respect to any shares as to which the decedent could have
                   exercised the Option at the time of death.


                                       E-3-3
<PAGE>

                   In the event any Option is exercised by the executors,
                   administrators, legatees or distributees of the estate of
                   a deceased optionee, the Company shall be under no
                   obligation to issue stock thereunder unless and until the
                   Company is satisfied that the person or persons exercising
                   the Option are the duly appointed legal representatives of
                   the deceased optionee's estate or the proper legatees or
                   distributees thereof.

   (e) Subject to subparagraph 5(d) (I) above, one-quarter (25%) of the total
       number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Option shall become
       exercisable beginning on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary date
       of the grant of the Option or (b) the completion of one term-year
       following the grant of the Option; thereafter an additional one-quarter
       (25%) of the shares shall become exercisable annually on the earlier of
       (a) the anniversary date of the grant of the Option or (b) the
       completion of an additional term-year of service as a member of the
       Board.


6. Adjustment in the Event of Change in Stock:

In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by
reason of stock dividends, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations,
split-ups, combinations or exchanges of shares and the like, the aggregate
number and class of shares available under the Plan, and the number, class
and the price of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Options shall
be appropriately adjusted by the Board, whose determination shall be
conclusive.


7. Miscellaneous Provisions:

   (a) Except as expressly provided for in the Plan, no Eligible Director or
       other person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Option under
       the Plan.  Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be
       construed as giving any Eligible Director any right to be retained in
       the service of the Company.

   (b) An optionee's rights and interest under the Plan may not be assigned
       or transferred in whole or in part either directly or by operation of
       law or otherwise (except in the event of an optionee's death, by will
       or the laws of descent and distribution), including, but not by way of
       limitations, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge,
       bankruptcy or in any other manner, and no such right or interest of
       any participant in the Plan shall be subject to any obligation or
       liability of such participant.

   (c) No Common Stock shares shall be issued hereunder unless counsel for
       the Company shall be satisfied that such issuance will be in compliance
       with applicable federal, state and other securities laws and
       regulations.

   (d) It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue
       Common Stock shares upon exercise of an Option, that the optionee (or
       any beneficiary or person entitled to act under subparagraph 5(d) (iv)
       above) pay to the Company, upon its demand, such amount as may be
       requested by the Company for the purpose of satisfying any liability
       to withhold federal, state, local or foreign income or other taxes.
       If the amount requested is not paid, the Company may refuse to issue
       Common Stock shares.


                                 E-3-4
<PAGE>

   (e) The expenses of the Plan shall be borne by the Company.

   (f) The Plan shall be unfunded.  The Company shall not be required to
       establish any special or separate fund or to make any other
       segregation of assets to assure the issuance of shares upon exercise
       of any Option under the Plan and issuance of shares upon exercise of
       Options shall be subordinate to the claims of the Company's general
       creditors.

   (g) By accepting any Option or other benefit under the Plan, each optionee
       and each person claiming under or through such person shall be
       conclusively deemed to have indicated his acceptance and ratification
       of, and consent to, any action taken under the Plan by the Company
       or the Board.


8. Amendment or Discontinuance:

The Plan may be amended at any time and from time to time by the Board as the
Board shall deem advisable, including, but not limited to amendments necessary
to qualify for any exemption or to comply with applicable law or regulations
provided, however, that except as provided in Paragraph 6 above, the Board
may not, without further approval by the shareholders of the Company in
accordance with Paragraph 10 below, increase the maximum number of shares
of Common Stock as to which Options may be granted under the Plan, increase
the number of shares subject to an Option, reduce the minimum Option
exercise price described in subparagraph 5(a) above, extend the period during
which Options may be granted or exercised under the Plan or change the class
of persons eligible to receive Options under the Plan.  No amendment of the
Plan shall materially and adversely affect any right of any optionee with
respect to any Option theretofore granted without such optionee's written
consent.


9. Termination:

This Plan shall terminate upon the earlier of the following dates or events
to occur:

   (a) upon the adoption of a resolution of the Board terminating the Plan; or

   (b) ten years from the date the Plan is initially approved and adopted by
       the shareholders of the Company in accordance with Paragraph 10 below.


10. Effective Date of Plan:

The Plan shall become effective as of May 1, 1990 or such later date as the
Board may determine, provided that the Company stockholders shall have adopted
the Plan at the Company's 1990 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

                                                    March 12, 1999



Mr. Charles A. Heimbold, Jr.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
345 Park Avenue
New York, New York 10154-0037

Dear Charlie:

Over the period since you assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer, your
leadership has significantly contributed to the Company's success, as
reflected in the substantial increase in the value of the Company by
approximately $100 billion as of year-end 1998.  In light of this, the
Compensation and Management Development Committee has approved the following
in exchange for your agreement to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer until December 31, 2001, or such earlier date as the Board of
Directors may appoint your successor. This new agreement, the provisions
of which are detailed below, replaces the original agreement dated
March 25, 1998.


* You are granted a Restricted Stock Award of 300,000 shares which will
vest upon your retirement on December 31, 2001, or such earlier date as
the Board of Directors may appoint your successor.

* Your annual bonus target will be determined by the Board but will not be
less than 170% of your base salary, and your base salary will not be less
than in 1998.

* After your retirement you will be provided with the benefits, support and
agreements similar to those historically provided to other retiring executives
who served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

* You are granted a Restricted Stock Award of 100,000 shares which will vest
on January 1, 2002.  In the event the Board of Directors appoints your
successor prior to December 31, 2001, and you elect to retire prior to
December 1, 2001, you may elect to have this Restricted Stock Award vest
at the time you elect to retire.

* Your Retirement Income Plan Benefit will be calculated on the basis of your
three-year final average pay (salary plus bonus) instead of the five-year
final average pay normally provided under the Plan.


                               E-4-1

<PAGE>


In calculating your pension benefit, the pension formula will be increased
to reflect an additional ten percentage points above that provided by the
normal formula for retirement benefits (It is estimated that the benefit
earned under the Plan will approximate 77% of your final average pay upon
retirement at the end of 2001.  This additional benefit would increase your
total retirement benefit to approximately 87% of final average pay).



                                      Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

                                                             ------------

Cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements made by the Company,
intended to have the benefit of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The Company is hereby filing a cautionary statement identifying important
factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially
from those projected in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Company.  There are several communications made by or on behalf of the
Company (including the Company's Annual Report to Stockholders and Form 10-K)
which contain statements relating to goals, plans and projections regarding
its financial position, results of operations, market position and product
development, among other things, which are based on current expectations that
involve inherit risks and uncertainties including factors that would delay,
divert or change one of them in the next several years.

These important factors include --

New government laws and regulations, such as (i) health care initiatives,
(ii) changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes which
may cause delays in approving new products, (iii) tax changes such as the
phasing out of tax benefits heretofore available in the United States and
certain foreign countries.

Difficulties in developing new products; new products developed by competitors
which have lower prices or superior performance features or which are
otherwise competitive with the Company's current products; and generic
competition as the Company's products go off patent, as well as possible
problems with licensors.

Legal difficulties including negative results relating to patents; adverse
decisions in litigation including the breast implant cases and other product
liability cases; the inability to obtain adequate insurance with respect to
this type of liability; recalls of pharmaceutical products or forced closings
of manufacturing plants.

Increasing pricing pressures worldwide from managed care buyers and
institutional and governmental purchasers; the impact of Year 2000 problems;
and changes of business and economic conditions including, but not limited to,
changes in interest rates and fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates.

No assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward looking
statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made.  The
Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward
looking statements as a result of future events or developments.
