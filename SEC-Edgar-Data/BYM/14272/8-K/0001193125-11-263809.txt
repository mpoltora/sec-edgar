limitation, a requirement to maintain a long term debt rating from a certain credit rating agency. There are no financial covenants in the Agreement. The Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment
of obligations under the Agreement, violation of covenants in the Agreement, breach or default of agreements related to debt equal to or greater than $100 million, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, certain judgments equal to or greater
than $100 million, or a change in control (as defined in the Agreement) of the Company. Certain of the defaults are subject to exceptions, materiality qualifiers and grace periods customary for credit facilities of this type. The Agreement provides
for borrowings by the Company, its U.S. subsidiaries and its non-U.S. subsidiaries. All borrowings by subsidiaries are guaranteed by the Company. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
