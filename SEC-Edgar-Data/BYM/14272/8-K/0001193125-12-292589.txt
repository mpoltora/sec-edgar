Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Bristol-Myers Squibb&#148;), B&amp;R Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;) and Amylin Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Amylin&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will commence a tender offer (the &#147;Offer&#148;) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Amylin (the &#147;Shares&#148;) at a price of $31.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash but subject to any required withholding taxes (the &#147;Offer Price&#148;). </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub will commence the Offer within 7 business days after June&nbsp;29, 2012, and that the Offer will remain
open for at least 20 business days. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, after the consummation of the Offer, and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Amylin (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with Amylin surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Upon completion of the Merger, each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the &#147;Effective Time&#148;) (other than Shares that are held by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merger Sub, Amylin in treasury or stockholders exercising their appraisal rights under
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;)) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash (without interest). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On June&nbsp;29, 2012, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, each of Daniel M. Bradbury, Mark G. Folleta, Orville G. Kolterman and Mark J. Gergen entered into a Tender and Support
Agreement (the &#147;Support Agreement&#148;) with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merger Sub and, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, Amylin. Collectively, these stockholders have ownership of an aggregate of 4,823,527 Shares (including Shares
represented by vested and unvested options they hold), or approximately 3% of the Shares (taking into account, for purposes of determining the aggregate Shares, Amylin&#146;s outstanding Shares and assuming the exercise of only the vested and
unvested options held by the stockholders who entered into the Support Agreement). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If Merger Sub holds 90% or more of the outstanding Shares
immediately following consummation of the Offer, Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merger Sub will take necessary and appropriate actions to effect a &#147;short-form&#148; merger under the DGCL as promptly as reasonably practicable without
additional approval by Amylin&#146;s stockholders. Otherwise, Amylin will hold a special stockholders&#146; meeting to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered into the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and there being validly tendered into the Offer (and not properly withdrawn prior to any then scheduled expiration of the Offer) a number of Shares that
constitutes at least a majority of the total number of the issued and outstanding Shares determined on a fully-diluted basis (such condition, the &#147;Minimum Condition&#148;). The Minimum Condition may be waived by Bristol-Myers Squibb or Merger
Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. The consummation of the Offer is not subject to any financing condition. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition,
subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Amylin has granted Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the &#147;Top-Up Option&#148;), exercisable only after Merger Sub has accepted and purchased Shares tendered in the Offer and on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to purchase from Amylin that number of Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares held by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merger Sub at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, will constitute one Share more than 90% of the total Shares then outstanding (determined after giving effect to the issuance of the Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merger Sub. The Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course
until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time. The Company has also agreed not to solicit or initiate discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire Amylin and to certain restrictions on its
ability to respond to any such proposals. </FONT></P>

materially from current expectations. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Among other risks, there can be no guarantee that the acquisition will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the anticipated time period
or that the expected benefits of the acquisition will be realized. The actual financial impact of this transaction may differ from the expected financial impact described in this press release. In addition, the compounds described in this release

it will close within the anticipated time period or that the expected benefits of the acquisition will be realized. The actual financial impact of this transaction may differ from the expected financial impact described in this press release. In
addition, the compounds described in this release are subject to all the risks inherent in the drug development process, and there can be no assurance that the development of these compounds will be commercially successful. Forward-looking
statements in the press release should be evaluated together with the many uncertainties that affect Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s business, particularly those identified in the cautionary factors discussion in Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s Annual
