STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">On November&nbsp;5, 2009 Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (&#147;MJN&#148;), an indirect subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the
&#147;Company&#148;), issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Notes due 2014 (the &#147;2014 Notes&#148;), $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.90% Notes due 2019 (the &#147;2019 Notes&#148;) and $300.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 5.90% Notes due 2039 (the &#147;2039 Notes&#148; and, together with the 2014 Notes and the 2019 Notes, the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture (the &#147;Base Indenture&#148;), dated as of
November&nbsp;1, 2009, by and between MJN and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture (the &#147;Supplemental Indenture&#148;), dated as of
November&nbsp;5, 2009, by and among MJN, Mead Johnson&nbsp;&amp; Company (&#147;MJC&#148;), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of MJN, and the Trustee. The Notes were issued in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Prior to the offer, MJC owed approximately $1,744.2 million in aggregate principal amount
to a subsidiary of the Company under intercompany notes (the &#147;Intercompany Debt&#148;). MJN used the net proceeds of the offering, which were approximately $1,482.7 million, to partly repay the Intercompany Debt on November 5, 2009. On November
10, 2009, MJN borrowed $200.0 million under its revolving credit agreement and used such proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay all but $50 million of the remaining balance of the Intercompany Debt. The Intercompany Debt that remains
outstanding is a portion of the floating rate note due 2014. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under their terms, the 2014 Notes bear interest at a rate of
3.50%&nbsp;per year, the 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.90%&nbsp;per year and the 2039 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.90%&nbsp;per year. MJN will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually on May&nbsp;1 and November&nbsp;1 of each year,
beginning May&nbsp;1, 2010. The 2014 Notes will mature on November&nbsp;1, 2014, the 2019 Notes will mature on November&nbsp;1, 2019 and the 2039 Notes will mature on November&nbsp;1, 2039. The Notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of
MJN&#146;s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by MJC. The Notes contain certain customary events of default and covenants, including limitations on consolidation, mergers, and sales of assets, limitations on the
incurrence of certain liens, and limitations on certain sale and leaseback transactions. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">At MJN&#146;s option, it may redeem
some or all of the Notes, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)&nbsp;100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of the redemption and
(ii)&nbsp;the sum of the net present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed discounted to the date of redemption at a specified rate, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount
to be redeemed to the date of the redemption. Additionally, if a change of control triggering event occurs, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require MJN to purchase all or a portion of such holder&#146;s Notes, at a purchase price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with the issuance of the Notes,
on November&nbsp;5, 2009, MJN and MJC entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley&nbsp;&amp; Co. Incorporated. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, MJN agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the Notes for freely tradable notes issued by MJN that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to the Notes. If MJN is unable to effect the exchange offer, MJN will use its reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a shelf registration statement relating to resales of the Notes. MJN will
be obligated to pay additional interest on the Notes if it does not complete the exchange offer (or, if required, the shelf registration is not declared effective) within 270 days after the issue date of the Notes. </FONT></P> <P

time liable as lessee and at any date as of which the amount thereof is to be determined, the total net obligations of the lessee for rental payments during the remaining term of the lease (including any period for which such lease has been extended
or may, at the option of the lessor, be extended) discounted from the respective due dates thereof to such determination date at a rate per annum equivalent to the greater of (a)&nbsp;the weighted-average interest rate of the Outstanding Securities,
such average being weighted by the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series and (b)&nbsp;the interest rate inherent in such lease (as determined in good faith by the Company), both to be compounded semi-annually. The total net
obligations of the lessee for rental payments under any such lease for any such periods shall be the aggregate amount of the rent payable by the lessee with respect to such period after excluding amounts required to be paid on account of maintenance
and repairs, services, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates and similar charges and contingent rents (such as those based on sales or monetary inflation). If any lease is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty and under the
terms of the lease the termination right is not exercisable until after the determination date and the amount of such penalty discounted to the determination date as provided above is less than the net amount of rentals payable after the time as of
which such termination could occur (the &#147;termination time&#148;) discounted to the determination date as provided above, then such discounted penalty amount shall be used instead of such discounted amount of net rentals payable after the
termination time in calculating the Attributable Debt for such lease. If any lease is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty and such termination right is exercisable on the determination date and the amount of the net rentals
payable under such lease after the determination date discounted to the determination date as provided above is greater than the amount of such penalty, the &#147;Attributable Debt&#148; for such lease as of such determination date shall be equal to
the amount of such penalty. If as of the determination date any Original Issue Discount Securities are Outstanding, then, for purposes of calculating Attributable Debt, the interest rate of the Original Issue Discount Securities shall be a rate
equal to the yield to maturity on such Securities, calculated at the time of the issuance of such Securities, and the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be equal to the aggregate amount that would then be payable upon
the acceleration of the maturity of such Securities pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.2 hereof. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
